The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1145(7 to 5), 1147(12 to 5), 1150(8 to 4), 1152(8 to 3), 1153(10 to 7), 1184(3 to 7), 1207(11 to 1), 1210(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1147: 50.000000), (1153: 10.000000), (1207: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1145: 3), (1147: 6), (1153: 3), (1207: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
