The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(7 to 5), 208(12 to 5), 211(8 to 4), 213(8 to 3), 214(10 to 7), 250(3 to 7), 278(11 to 1), 283(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(208: 50.000000), (214: 10.000000), (250: 35.000000), (278: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 4), (208: 6), (211: 2), (213: 8), (214: 4), (250: 4), (278: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
