The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
838(7 to 5), 840(12 to 5), 844(8 to 4), 846(8 to 3), 847(10 to 7), 880(3 to 7), 904(11 to 1), 907(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(847: 10.000000), (904: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(838: 4), (840: 4), (847: 6), (904: 3), (907: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
