The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
853(7 to 5), 855(12 to 5), 859(8 to 4), 861(8 to 3), 862(10 to 7), 898(3 to 7), 918(11 to 1), 920(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(859: 120.000000), (861: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(853: 8), (855: 4), (859: 3), (861: 6), (862: 4), (898: 1), (920: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
