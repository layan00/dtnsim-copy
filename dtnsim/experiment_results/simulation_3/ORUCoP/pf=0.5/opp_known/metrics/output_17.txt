The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
795(7 to 5), 797(12 to 5), 802(8 to 4), 804(8 to 3), 805(10 to 7), 841(3 to 7), 864(11 to 1), 868(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(805: 10.000000), (841: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(795: 8), (797: 4), (805: 4), (841: 4), (868: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
