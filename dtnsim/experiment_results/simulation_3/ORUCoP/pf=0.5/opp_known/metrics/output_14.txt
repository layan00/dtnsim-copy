The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1481(7 to 5), 1483(12 to 5), 1489(8 to 4), 1491(8 to 3), 1492(10 to 7), 1525(3 to 7), 1549(11 to 1), 1556(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1491: 130.000000), (1492: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1481: 4), (1483: 2), (1489: 5), (1491: 6), (1492: 4), (1549: 1), (1556: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
