The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(7 to 5), 203(12 to 5), 207(8 to 4), 209(8 to 3), 210(10 to 7), 246(3 to 7), 270(11 to 1), 275(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 10.000000), (246: 35.000000), (270: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 2), (203: 4), (207: 2), (209: 2), (210: 6), (246: 4), (270: 3), (275: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
