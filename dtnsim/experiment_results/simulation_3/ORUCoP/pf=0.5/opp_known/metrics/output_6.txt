The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
521(7 to 5), 524(12 to 5), 531(8 to 4), 534(8 to 3), 535(10 to 7), 576(3 to 7), 602(11 to 1), 605(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(524: 50.000000), (535: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(521: 6), (524: 6), (531: 2), (534: 2), (535: 10), (602: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
