The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1182(7 to 5), 1184(12 to 5), 1189(8 to 4), 1191(8 to 3), 1192(10 to 7), 1225(3 to 7), 1252(11 to 1), 1263(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1191: 70.000000), (1192: 50.000000), (1225: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1182: 2), (1184: 4), (1189: 6), (1191: 6), (1192: 5), (1225: 4), (1252: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
