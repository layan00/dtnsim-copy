The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1496(7 to 5), 1498(12 to 5), 1503(8 to 4), 1505(8 to 3), 1506(10 to 7), 1551(3 to 7), 1576(11 to 1), 1583(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1505: 130.000000), (1506: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1496: 6), (1498: 4), (1503: 5), (1505: 6), (1506: 8), (1576: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
