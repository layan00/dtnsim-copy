The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(7 to 5), 220(12 to 5), 224(8 to 4), 226(8 to 3), 227(10 to 7), 259(3 to 7), 289(11 to 1), 296(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(217: 60.000000), (220: 50.000000), (227: 50.000000), (259: 35.000000), (289: 80.000000), (296: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 6), (220: 6), (227: 5), (259: 4), (289: 3), (296: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
