The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
537(7 to 5), 540(12 to 5), 545(8 to 4), 548(8 to 3), 549(10 to 7), 581(3 to 7), 608(11 to 1), 611(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(537: 60.000000), (540: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(537: 9), (540: 6), (549: 2), (581: 1), (608: 1), (611: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
