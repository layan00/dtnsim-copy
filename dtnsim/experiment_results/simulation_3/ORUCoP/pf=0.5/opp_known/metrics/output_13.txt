The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1157(7 to 5), 1159(12 to 5), 1164(8 to 4), 1166(8 to 3), 1167(10 to 7), 1202(3 to 7), 1233(11 to 1), 1238(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1159: 50.000000), (1167: 10.000000), (1202: 35.000000), (1238: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1157: 2), (1159: 6), (1167: 10), (1202: 4), (1233: 2), (1238: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
