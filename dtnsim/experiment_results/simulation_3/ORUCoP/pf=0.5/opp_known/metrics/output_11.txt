The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
530(7 to 5), 533(12 to 5), 536(8 to 4), 538(8 to 3), 539(10 to 7), 564(3 to 7), 591(11 to 1), 594(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(533: 50.000000), (539: 10.000000), (591: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(530: 3), (533: 6), (539: 4), (591: 3), (594: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
