The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1449(7 to 5), 1451(12 to 5), 1456(8 to 4), 1458(8 to 3), 1459(10 to 7), 1504(3 to 7), 1524(11 to 1), 1527(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1459: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1449: 6), (1451: 4), (1456: 2), (1458: 8), (1459: 8), (1524: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
