The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(7 to 5), 201(12 to 5), 208(8 to 4), 211(8 to 3), 212(10 to 7), 237(3 to 7), 260(11 to 1), 263(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 50.000000), (212: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 6), (201: 3), (212: 3), (260: 1), (263: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
