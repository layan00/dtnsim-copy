The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1176(7 to 5), 1179(12 to 5), 1183(8 to 4), 1186(8 to 3), 1187(10 to 7), 1217(3 to 7), 1239(11 to 1), 1244(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1187: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1176: 6), (1179: 4), (1187: 5), (1239: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
