The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(7 to 5), 236(12 to 5), 242(8 to 4), 244(8 to 3), 245(10 to 7), 276(3 to 7), 305(11 to 1), 310(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 120.000000), (244: 90.000000), (245: 10.000000), (305: 80.000000), (310: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 10), (236: 4), (242: 4), (244: 3), (245: 4), (276: 6), (305: 5), (310: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 545 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
