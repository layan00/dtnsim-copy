The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
865(7 to 5), 867(12 to 5), 871(8 to 4), 873(8 to 3), 874(10 to 7), 900(3 to 7), 926(11 to 1), 930(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(867: 50.000000), (873: 90.000000), (874: 10.000000), (900: 35.000000), (930: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(865: 4), (867: 3), (871: 2), (873: 3), (874: 4), (900: 4), (930: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
