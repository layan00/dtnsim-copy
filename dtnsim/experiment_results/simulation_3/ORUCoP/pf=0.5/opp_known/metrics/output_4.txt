The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1488(7 to 5), 1491(12 to 5), 1498(8 to 4), 1500(8 to 3), 1501(10 to 7), 1533(3 to 7), 1555(11 to 1), 1561(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1498: 120.000000), (1500: 90.000000), (1501: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1488: 3), (1491: 4), (1498: 7), (1500: 6), (1501: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
