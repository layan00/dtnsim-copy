The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
531(7 to 5), 534(12 to 5), 541(8 to 4), 544(8 to 3), 545(10 to 7), 580(3 to 7), 603(11 to 1), 605(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(534: 50.000000), (541: 120.000000), (544: 90.000000), (545: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(531: 7), (534: 6), (541: 3), (544: 6), (545: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
