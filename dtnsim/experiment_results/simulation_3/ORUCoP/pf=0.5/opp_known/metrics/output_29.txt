The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1508(7 to 5), 1510(12 to 5), 1516(8 to 4), 1518(8 to 3), 1519(10 to 7), 1553(3 to 7), 1574(11 to 1), 1577(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1508: 60.000000), (1510: 50.000000), (1516: 120.000000), (1518: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1508: 5), (1510: 6), (1516: 4), (1518: 3), (1519: 2), (1553: 1), (1574: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
