The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
494(7 to 5), 497(12 to 5), 502(8 to 4), 504(8 to 3), 505(10 to 7), 530(3 to 7), 550(11 to 1), 552(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(497: 50.000000), (504: 130.000000), (505: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(494: 3), (497: 3), (502: 1), (504: 10), (505: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
