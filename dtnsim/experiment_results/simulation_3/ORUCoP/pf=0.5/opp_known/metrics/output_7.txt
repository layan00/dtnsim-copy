The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
840(7 to 5), 843(12 to 5), 849(8 to 4), 852(8 to 3), 853(10 to 7), 881(3 to 7), 901(11 to 1), 904(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(849: 120.000000), (852: 90.000000), (853: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(840: 6), (843: 4), (849: 3), (852: 3), (853: 4), (901: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
