The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1116(7 to 5), 1118(12 to 5), 1126(8 to 4), 1128(8 to 3), 1129(10 to 7), 1170(3 to 7), 1193(11 to 1), 1200(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1128: 130.000000), (1129: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1116: 8), (1118: 4), (1126: 5), (1128: 8), (1129: 3), (1170: 1), (1193: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
