The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
850(7 to 5), 852(12 to 5), 859(8 to 4), 861(8 to 3), 862(10 to 7), 888(3 to 7), 912(11 to 1), 915(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(852: 50.000000), (861: 130.000000), (862: 10.000000), (915: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(850: 3), (852: 3), (859: 1), (861: 10), (862: 3), (912: 2), (915: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
