The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
559(7 to 5), 562(12 to 5), 567(8 to 4), 570(8 to 3), 571(10 to 7), 605(3 to 7), 626(11 to 1), 628(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(570: 130.000000), (571: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(559: 7), (562: 4), (567: 1), (570: 10), (571: 5), (628: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
