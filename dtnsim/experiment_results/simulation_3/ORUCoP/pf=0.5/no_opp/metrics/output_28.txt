The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
455(7 to 5), 457(12 to 5), 463(8 to 4), 465(8 to 3), 466(10 to 7), 483(3 to 7), 494(11 to 1), 499(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(466: 70.000000), (483: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(457: 1), (463: 2), (465: 2), (466: 6), (483: 3), (494: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
