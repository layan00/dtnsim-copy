The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
324(7 to 5), 326(12 to 5), 332(8 to 4), 334(8 to 3), 335(10 to 7), 342(3 to 7), 350(11 to 1), 353(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(332: 120.000000), (334: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(332: 3), (334: 2), (335: 2), (342: 1), (350: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
