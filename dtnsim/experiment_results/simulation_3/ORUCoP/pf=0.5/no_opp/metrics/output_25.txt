The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(7 to 5), 68(12 to 5), 75(8 to 4), 78(8 to 3), 79(10 to 7), 94(3 to 7), 105(11 to 1), 107(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(68: 4), (75: 2), (78: 2), (79: 2), (94: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 68: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 94: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6:
