The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
333(7 to 5), 335(12 to 5), 340(8 to 4), 343(8 to 3), 344(10 to 7), 353(3 to 7), 360(11 to 1), 362(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(340: 120.000000), (343: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(335: 3), (340: 3), (343: 2), (362: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2:
