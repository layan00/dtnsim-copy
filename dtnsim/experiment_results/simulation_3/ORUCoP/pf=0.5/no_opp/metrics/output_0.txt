The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
92(7 to 5), 98(12 to 5), 106(8 to 4), 111(8 to 3), 112(10 to 7), 129(3 to 7), 141(11 to 1), 146(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(106: 120.000000), (111: 90.000000), (141: 80.000000), (146: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(92: 8), (98: 6), (106: 6), (111: 4), (129: 3), (141: 6), (146: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 79 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
