The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
74(7 to 5), 76(12 to 5), 79(8 to 4), 81(8 to 3), 82(10 to 7), 97(3 to 7), 112(11 to 1), 116(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(112: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(76: 2), (79: 2), (81: 2), (82: 5), (112: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
