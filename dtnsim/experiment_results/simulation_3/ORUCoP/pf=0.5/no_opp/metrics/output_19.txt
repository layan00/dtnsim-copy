The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
555(7 to 5), 557(12 to 5), 563(8 to 4), 565(8 to 3), 566(10 to 7), 582(3 to 7), 595(11 to 1), 599(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(565: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(563: 4), (565: 4), (566: 5), (582: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
