The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
592(7 to 5), 594(12 to 5), 600(8 to 4), 602(8 to 3), 603(10 to 7), 621(3 to 7), 634(11 to 1), 639(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(603: 70.000000), (621: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(594: 3), (600: 2), (602: 2), (603: 4), (621: 3), (634: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
