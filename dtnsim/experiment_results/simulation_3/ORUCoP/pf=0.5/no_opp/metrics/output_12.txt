The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
320(7 to 5), 322(12 to 5), 326(8 to 4), 328(8 to 3), 329(10 to 7), 342(3 to 7), 354(11 to 1), 359(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(354: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(322: 2), (329: 4), (342: 2), (354: 3), (359: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
