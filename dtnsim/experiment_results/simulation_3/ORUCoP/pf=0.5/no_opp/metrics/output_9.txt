The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
557(7 to 5), 559(12 to 5), 564(8 to 4), 566(8 to 3), 567(10 to 7), 586(3 to 7), 595(11 to 1), 598(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(559: 4), (564: 2), (566: 2), (586: 1), (595: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 586: (to: 4, time: 45.000000),
