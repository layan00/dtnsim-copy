The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(7 to 5), 68(12 to 5), 75(8 to 4), 77(8 to 3), 78(10 to 7), 82(3 to 7), 96(11 to 1), 103(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(78: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 8), (96: 1), (103: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 78: (to: 9, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 78: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 103: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 78: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 78: (to: 7, time: 80.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 78: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 60.000000),
