The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
468(7 to 5), 470(12 to 5), 474(8 to 4), 476(8 to 3), 477(10 to 7), 484(3 to 7), 493(11 to 1), 496(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(493: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(474: 1), (476: 1), (484: 1), (493: 3), (496: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 484: (to: 4, time: 45.000000),
