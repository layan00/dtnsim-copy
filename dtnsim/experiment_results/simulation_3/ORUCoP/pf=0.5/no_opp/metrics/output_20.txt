The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
85(7 to 5), 87(12 to 5), 91(8 to 4), 93(8 to 3), 94(10 to 7), 108(3 to 7), 121(11 to 1), 128(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(121: 80.000000), (128: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(94: 7), (108: 2), (121: 3), (128: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 94: (to: 9, time: 80.000000),
