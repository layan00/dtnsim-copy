The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
418(7 to 5), 420(12 to 5), 429(8 to 4), 431(8 to 3), 432(10 to 7), 450(3 to 7), 459(11 to 1), 464(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(432: 70.000000), (450: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(420: 1), (429: 2), (431: 2), (432: 6), (450: 3), (459: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
