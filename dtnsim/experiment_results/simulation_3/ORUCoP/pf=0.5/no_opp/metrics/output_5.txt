The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
69(7 to 5), 71(12 to 5), 76(8 to 4), 78(8 to 3), 79(10 to 7), 96(3 to 7), 106(11 to 1), 111(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(106: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(71: 2), (76: 2), (78: 2), (79: 4), (96: 2), (106: 3), (111: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
