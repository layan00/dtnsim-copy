The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
588(7 to 5), 590(12 to 5), 596(8 to 4), 598(8 to 3), 599(10 to 7), 613(3 to 7), 618(11 to 1), 621(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(596: 120.000000), (598: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(596: 6), (598: 4), (599: 2), (618: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
