The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
360(7 to 5), 362(12 to 5), 366(8 to 4), 368(8 to 3), 369(10 to 7), 374(3 to 7), 386(11 to 1), 388(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(368: 90.000000), (388: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(366: 2), (368: 2), (369: 2), (388: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 388: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 366: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Bundle 368: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Bundle 388: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 388: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5:

Node 8: 
Bundle 366: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Bundle 368: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 369: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 60.000000),
