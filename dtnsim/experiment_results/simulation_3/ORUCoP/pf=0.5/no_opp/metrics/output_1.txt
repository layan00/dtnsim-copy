The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
244(7 to 5), 246(12 to 5), 252(8 to 4), 255(8 to 3), 256(10 to 7), 270(3 to 7), 280(11 to 1), 287(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(256: 50.000000), (270: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 4), (252: 1), (255: 1), (256: 8), (270: 3), (287: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
