The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1933(7 to 5), 1941(12 to 5), 1958(8 to 4), 1960(8 to 3), 1961(10 to 7), 2006(3 to 7), 2051(11 to 1), 2059(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1958: 120.000000), (1960: 90.000000), (2051: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1933: 9), (1941: 3), (1958: 6), (1960: 4), (1961: 6), (2006: 2), (2051: 6), (2059: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 184 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
