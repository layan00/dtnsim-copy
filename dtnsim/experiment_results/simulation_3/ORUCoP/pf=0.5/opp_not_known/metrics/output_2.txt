The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1094(7 to 5), 1096(12 to 5), 1114(8 to 4), 1116(8 to 3), 1117(10 to 7), 1148(3 to 7), 1198(11 to 1), 1204(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1096: 50.000000), (1116: 90.000000), (1198: 20.000000), (1204: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1094: 2), (1096: 6), (1114: 2), (1116: 2), (1117: 2), (1198: 6), (1204: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 145 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
