The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
646(7 to 5), 652(12 to 5), 673(8 to 4), 679(8 to 3), 680(10 to 7), 717(3 to 7), 767(11 to 1), 772(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(652: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(646: 6), (652: 6), (673: 2), (679: 2), (680: 4), (767: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 106 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
