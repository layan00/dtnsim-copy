The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
634(7 to 5), 638(12 to 5), 659(8 to 4), 662(8 to 3), 663(10 to 7), 702(3 to 7), 749(11 to 1), 755(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(638: 50.000000), (659: 120.000000), (662: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(634: 5), (638: 6), (659: 3), (662: 2), (663: 4), (702: 1), (749: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 121 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
