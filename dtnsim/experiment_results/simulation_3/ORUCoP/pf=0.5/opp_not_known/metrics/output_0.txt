The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(7 to 5), 236(12 to 5), 252(8 to 4), 254(8 to 3), 255(10 to 7), 299(3 to 7), 350(11 to 1), 357(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(252: 120.000000), (254: 90.000000), (255: 50.000000), (350: 80.000000), (357: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 10), (236: 4), (252: 6), (254: 4), (255: 4), (299: 5), (350: 5), (357: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 161 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
