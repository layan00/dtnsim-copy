The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1069(7 to 5), 1071(12 to 5), 1089(8 to 4), 1093(8 to 3), 1094(10 to 7), 1130(3 to 7), 1178(11 to 1), 1184(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1071: 10.000000), (1178: 20.000000), (1184: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1069: 2), (1071: 6), (1094: 2), (1130: 3), (1178: 5), (1184: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
