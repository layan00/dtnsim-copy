The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(7 to 5), 227(12 to 5), 245(8 to 4), 248(8 to 3), 249(10 to 7), 288(3 to 7), 340(11 to 1), 349(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 60.000000), (227: 50.000000), (340: 80.000000), (349: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 7), (227: 6), (249: 9), (288: 3), (340: 5), (349: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 136 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
