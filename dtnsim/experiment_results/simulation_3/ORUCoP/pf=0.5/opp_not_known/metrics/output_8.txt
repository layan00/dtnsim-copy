The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1490(7 to 5), 1492(12 to 5), 1509(8 to 4), 1511(8 to 3), 1512(10 to 7), 1552(3 to 7), 1600(11 to 1), 1607(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1492: 50.000000), (1600: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1490: 3), (1492: 6), (1512: 8), (1552: 3), (1600: 5), (1607: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
