The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1919(7 to 5), 1921(12 to 5), 1940(8 to 4), 1942(8 to 3), 1943(10 to 7), 1985(3 to 7), 2030(11 to 1), 2035(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1919: 3), (1921: 4), (1940: 2), (1942: 2), (1943: 2), (1985: 1), (2030: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 173 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
