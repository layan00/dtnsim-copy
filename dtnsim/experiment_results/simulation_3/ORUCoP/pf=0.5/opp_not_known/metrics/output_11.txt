The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
645(7 to 5), 649(12 to 5), 666(8 to 4), 668(8 to 3), 669(10 to 7), 697(3 to 7), 749(11 to 1), 754(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(649: 50.000000), (749: 20.000000), (754: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(645: 2), (649: 6), (669: 2), (749: 5), (754: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
