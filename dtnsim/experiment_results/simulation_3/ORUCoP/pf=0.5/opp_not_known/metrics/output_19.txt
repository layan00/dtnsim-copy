The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1933(7 to 5), 1937(12 to 5), 1957(8 to 4), 1961(8 to 3), 1962(10 to 7), 2001(3 to 7), 2054(11 to 1), 2062(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1937: 10.000000), (1961: 90.000000), (2054: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1933: 2), (1937: 6), (1957: 4), (1961: 4), (1962: 6), (2001: 6), (2054: 6), (2062: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 128 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
