The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1948(7 to 5), 1950(12 to 5), 1969(8 to 4), 1973(8 to 3), 1974(10 to 7), 2018(3 to 7), 2068(11 to 1), 2075(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1950: 10.000000), (1974: 70.000000), (2018: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1948: 3), (1950: 6), (1969: 2), (1973: 2), (1974: 8), (2018: 3), (2068: 3), (2075: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
