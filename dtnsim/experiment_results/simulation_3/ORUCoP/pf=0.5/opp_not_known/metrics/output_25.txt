The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(7 to 5), 208(12 to 5), 228(8 to 4), 233(8 to 3), 234(10 to 7), 272(3 to 7), 319(11 to 1), 325(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(208: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 7), (208: 6), (228: 2), (233: 2), (234: 2), (272: 1), (319: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
