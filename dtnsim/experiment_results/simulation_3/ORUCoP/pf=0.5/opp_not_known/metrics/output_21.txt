The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
658(7 to 5), 662(12 to 5), 681(8 to 4), 683(8 to 3), 684(10 to 7), 718(3 to 7), 767(11 to 1), 772(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(662: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(658: 2), (662: 6), (684: 2), (767: 3), (772: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 93 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
