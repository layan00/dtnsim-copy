The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1060(7 to 5), 1062(12 to 5), 1083(8 to 4), 1087(8 to 3), 1088(10 to 7), 1123(3 to 7), 1171(11 to 1), 1177(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1062: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1060: 3), (1062: 6), (1083: 1), (1087: 1), (1088: 2), (1123: 3), (1171: 4), (1177: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 129 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
