The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
673(7 to 5), 677(12 to 5), 696(8 to 4), 699(8 to 3), 700(10 to 7), 738(3 to 7), 784(11 to 1), 795(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(700: 50.000000), (738: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(673: 5), (677: 4), (696: 1), (699: 1), (700: 8), (738: 3), (784: 4), (795: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 132 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
