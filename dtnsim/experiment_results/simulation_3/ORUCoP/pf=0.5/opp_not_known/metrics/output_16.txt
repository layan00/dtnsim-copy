The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
626(7 to 5), 630(12 to 5), 649(8 to 4), 653(8 to 3), 654(10 to 7), 686(3 to 7), 733(11 to 1), 741(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(630: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(626: 2), (630: 6), (649: 1), (653: 1), (654: 6), (686: 4), (733: 4), (741: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
