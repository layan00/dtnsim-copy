The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1078(7 to 5), 1080(12 to 5), 1098(8 to 4), 1100(8 to 3), 1101(10 to 7), 1137(3 to 7), 1183(11 to 1), 1189(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1098: 120.000000), (1100: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1078: 4), (1080: 4), (1098: 3), (1100: 2), (1137: 4), (1183: 4), (1189: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 180 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
