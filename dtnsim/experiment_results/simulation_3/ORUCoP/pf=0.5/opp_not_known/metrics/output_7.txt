The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1071(7 to 5), 1075(12 to 5), 1095(8 to 4), 1100(8 to 3), 1101(10 to 7), 1136(3 to 7), 1181(11 to 1), 1186(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1075: 10.000000), (1095: 120.000000), (1100: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1071: 5), (1075: 6), (1095: 3), (1100: 2), (1101: 4), (1136: 2), (1181: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 125 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
