The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1044(7 to 5), 1046(12 to 5), 1065(8 to 4), 1069(8 to 3), 1070(10 to 7), 1111(3 to 7), 1159(11 to 1), 1168(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1046: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1044: 4), (1046: 6), (1070: 6), (1111: 6), (1159: 4), (1168: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 163 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
