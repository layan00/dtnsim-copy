The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1946(7 to 5), 1948(12 to 5), 1968(8 to 4), 1972(8 to 3), 1973(10 to 7), 2013(3 to 7), 2060(11 to 1), 2067(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1948: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1946: 2), (1948: 6), (1968: 2), (1972: 2), (1973: 2), (2013: 5), (2060: 3), (2067: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 154 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
