The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1512(7 to 5), 1518(12 to 5), 1536(8 to 4), 1538(8 to 3), 1539(10 to 7), 1570(3 to 7), 1615(11 to 1), 1620(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1615: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1512: 4), (1518: 6), (1536: 1), (1538: 1), (1539: 2), (1570: 1), (1615: 5), (1620: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 128 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
