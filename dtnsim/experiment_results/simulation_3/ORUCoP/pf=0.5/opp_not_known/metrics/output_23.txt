The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1505(7 to 5), 1513(12 to 5), 1527(8 to 4), 1529(8 to 3), 1530(10 to 7), 1574(3 to 7), 1620(11 to 1), 1627(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1620: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1505: 10), (1513: 4), (1530: 8), (1574: 3), (1620: 4), (1627: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 151 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
