The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
48(7 to 5), 50(12 to 5), 53(8 to 4), 55(8 to 3), 56(10 to 7), 67(3 to 7), 74(11 to 1), 77(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(77: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(56: 5), (67: 1), (77: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 77: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 77: (to: 3, time: 120.000000),
