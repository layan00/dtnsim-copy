The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
343(7 to 5), 345(12 to 5), 350(8 to 4), 352(8 to 3), 353(10 to 7), 364(3 to 7), 370(11 to 1), 372(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(345: 2), (350: 2), (352: 2), (353: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
