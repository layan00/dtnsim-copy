The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
149(7 to 5), 151(12 to 5), 155(8 to 4), 157(8 to 3), 158(10 to 7), 164(3 to 7), 174(11 to 1), 178(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(155: 1), (157: 1), (158: 2), (164: 2), (174: 2), (178: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
