The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
308(7 to 5), 310(12 to 5), 314(8 to 4), 316(8 to 3), 317(10 to 7), 326(3 to 7), 332(11 to 1), 335(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(316: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(314: 4), (316: 4), (317: 2), (332: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 314: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Bundle 316: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8:

Bundle 316: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 317: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 60.000000),
