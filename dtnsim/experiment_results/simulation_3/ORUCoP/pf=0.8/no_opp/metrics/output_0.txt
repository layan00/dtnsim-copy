The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
40(7 to 5), 42(12 to 5), 44(8 to 4), 46(8 to 3), 47(10 to 7), 58(3 to 7), 65(11 to 1), 69(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(46: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(44: 4), (46: 4), (65: 2), (69: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 78 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 44: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), (to: 3, time: 120.000000),
