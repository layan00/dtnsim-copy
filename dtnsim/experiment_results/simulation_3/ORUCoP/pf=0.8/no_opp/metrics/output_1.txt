The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
128(7 to 5), 130(12 to 5), 135(8 to 4), 138(8 to 3), 139(10 to 7), 148(3 to 7), 154(11 to 1), 156(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(130: 3), (139: 2), (156: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 130: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 156: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 139: (to: 3, time: 40.000000), (to: 3, time: 40.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 130: (to: 2, time: 10.000000), (to: 11, time: 40.000000), 
Node 13: 
Node 14:
