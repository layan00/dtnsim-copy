The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
238(7 to 5), 240(12 to 5), 243(8 to 4), 245(8 to 3), 246(10 to 7), 249(3 to 7), 254(11 to 1), 257(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(254: 1), (257: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
