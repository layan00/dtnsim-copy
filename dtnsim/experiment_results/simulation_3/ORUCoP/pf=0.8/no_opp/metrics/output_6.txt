The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
121(7 to 5), 123(12 to 5), 127(8 to 4), 129(8 to 3), 130(10 to 7), 142(3 to 7), 147(11 to 1), 149(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(123: 2), (127: 2), (129: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
