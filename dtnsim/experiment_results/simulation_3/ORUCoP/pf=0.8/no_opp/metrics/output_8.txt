The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
250(7 to 5), 252(12 to 5), 255(8 to 4), 257(8 to 3), 258(10 to 7), 268(3 to 7), 273(11 to 1), 276(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(252: 1), (258: 4), (268: 1), (273: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 258: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 268: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 4:

Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 258: (to: 3, time: 40.000000), (to: 3, time: 40.000000), 
Node 11:
