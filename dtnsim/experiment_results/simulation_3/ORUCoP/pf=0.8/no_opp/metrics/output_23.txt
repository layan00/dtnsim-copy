The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
265(7 to 5), 267(12 to 5), 271(8 to 4), 273(8 to 3), 274(10 to 7), 284(3 to 7), 291(11 to 1), 295(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(267: 1), (274: 5), (284: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 274: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 284: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 274: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 284: (to: 6, time: 80.000000),
