The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
152(7 to 5), 154(12 to 5), 157(8 to 4), 159(8 to 3), 160(10 to 7), 168(3 to 7), 175(11 to 1), 177(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(154: 2), (160: 1), (177: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 177: (to: 1, time: 85.000000),

Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 160: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 154: (to: 11, time: 40.000000), (to: 11, time: 40.000000),
