The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
42(7 to 5), 44(12 to 5), 50(8 to 4), 52(8 to 3), 53(10 to 7), 57(3 to 7), 67(11 to 1), 69(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(53: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 53: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 53: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 60.000000),
