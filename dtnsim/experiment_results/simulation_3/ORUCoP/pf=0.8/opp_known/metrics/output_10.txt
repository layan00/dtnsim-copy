The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
159(7 to 5), 161(12 to 5), 165(8 to 4), 167(8 to 3), 168(10 to 7), 192(3 to 7), 207(11 to 1), 209(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(159: 2), (161: 4), (168: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
