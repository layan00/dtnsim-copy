The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
407(7 to 5), 409(12 to 5), 413(8 to 4), 415(8 to 3), 416(10 to 7), 439(3 to 7), 459(11 to 1), 462(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(409: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(407: 2), (409: 6), (416: 4), (459: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
