The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
647(7 to 5), 649(12 to 5), 654(8 to 4), 656(8 to 3), 657(10 to 7), 680(3 to 7), 696(11 to 1), 698(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(657: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(647: 2), (649: 4), (657: 3), (698: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 698: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 647: (to: 15, time: 40.000000), 
Node 8:
