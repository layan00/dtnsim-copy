The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
437(7 to 5), 439(12 to 5), 444(8 to 4), 446(8 to 3), 447(10 to 7), 472(3 to 7), 492(11 to 1), 494(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(439: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(437: 3), (439: 6), (447: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
