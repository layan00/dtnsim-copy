The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1172(7 to 5), 1174(12 to 5), 1181(8 to 4), 1183(8 to 3), 1184(10 to 7), 1209(3 to 7), 1224(11 to 1), 1227(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1184: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1172: 4), (1174: 4), (1181: 1), (1183: 2), (1184: 3), (1224: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
