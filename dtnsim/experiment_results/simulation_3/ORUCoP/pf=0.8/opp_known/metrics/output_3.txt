The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
946(7 to 5), 948(12 to 5), 953(8 to 4), 955(8 to 3), 956(10 to 7), 979(3 to 7), 996(11 to 1), 999(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(946: 2), (948: 4), (956: 4), (996: 1), (999: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
