The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1208(7 to 5), 1210(12 to 5), 1216(8 to 4), 1218(8 to 3), 1219(10 to 7), 1248(3 to 7), 1267(11 to 1), 1270(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1210: 50.000000), (1218: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1208: 2), (1210: 6), (1216: 3), (1218: 3), (1219: 4), (1248: 1), (1267: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
