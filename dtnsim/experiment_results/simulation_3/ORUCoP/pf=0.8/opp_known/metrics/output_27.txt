The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
670(7 to 5), 672(12 to 5), 678(8 to 4), 681(8 to 3), 682(10 to 7), 705(3 to 7), 725(11 to 1), 728(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(672: 10.000000), (682: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(670: 2), (672: 4), (678: 1), (681: 2), (682: 3), (725: 2), (728: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
