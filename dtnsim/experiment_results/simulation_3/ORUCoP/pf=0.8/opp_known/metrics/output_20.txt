The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(7 to 5), 182(12 to 5), 187(8 to 4), 189(8 to 3), 190(10 to 7), 215(3 to 7), 233(11 to 1), 235(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(180: 2), (182: 4), (190: 2), (235: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 235: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 235: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 235: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 180: (to: 15, time: 40.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9:
