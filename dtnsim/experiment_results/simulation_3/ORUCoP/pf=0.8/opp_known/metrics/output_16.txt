The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
415(7 to 5), 417(12 to 5), 421(8 to 4), 423(8 to 3), 424(10 to 7), 446(3 to 7), 461(11 to 1), 463(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(415: 2), (417: 4), (424: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
