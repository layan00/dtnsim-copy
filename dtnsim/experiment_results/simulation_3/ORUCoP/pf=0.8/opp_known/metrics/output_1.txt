The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
457(7 to 5), 459(12 to 5), 465(8 to 4), 467(8 to 3), 468(10 to 7), 495(3 to 7), 513(11 to 1), 515(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(468: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(457: 2), (459: 4), (468: 5), (515: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
