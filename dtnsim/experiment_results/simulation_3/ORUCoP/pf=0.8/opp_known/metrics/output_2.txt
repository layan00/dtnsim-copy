The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
700(7 to 5), 702(12 to 5), 706(8 to 4), 708(8 to 3), 709(10 to 7), 735(3 to 7), 751(11 to 1), 753(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(708: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(700: 4), (702: 4), (706: 2), (708: 3), (709: 4), (753: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
