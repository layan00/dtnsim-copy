The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(7 to 5), 666(12 to 5), 671(8 to 4), 674(8 to 3), 675(10 to 7), 700(3 to 7), 719(11 to 1), 721(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(666: 10.000000), (675: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(664: 2), (666: 4), (675: 5), (721: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
