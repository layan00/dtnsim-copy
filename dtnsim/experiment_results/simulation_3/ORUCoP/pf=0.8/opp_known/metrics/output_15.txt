The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
174(7 to 5), 176(12 to 5), 184(8 to 4), 186(8 to 3), 187(10 to 7), 210(3 to 7), 230(11 to 1), 232(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(176: 50.000000), (187: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(174: 2), (176: 6), (187: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
