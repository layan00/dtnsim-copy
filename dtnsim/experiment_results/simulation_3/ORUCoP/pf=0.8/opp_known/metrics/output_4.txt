The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1204(7 to 5), 1206(12 to 5), 1212(8 to 4), 1215(8 to 3), 1216(10 to 7), 1242(3 to 7), 1261(11 to 1), 1267(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1206: 10.000000), (1215: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1204: 2), (1206: 4), (1212: 6), (1215: 6), (1216: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
