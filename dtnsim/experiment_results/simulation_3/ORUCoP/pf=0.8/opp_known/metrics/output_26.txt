The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
408(7 to 5), 410(12 to 5), 416(8 to 4), 418(8 to 3), 419(10 to 7), 453(3 to 7), 469(11 to 1), 471(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(419: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(408: 6), (410: 4), (419: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
