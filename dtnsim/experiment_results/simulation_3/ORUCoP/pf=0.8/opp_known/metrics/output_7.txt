The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
692(7 to 5), 694(12 to 5), 699(8 to 4), 701(8 to 3), 702(10 to 7), 726(3 to 7), 744(11 to 1), 747(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(692: 2), (694: 4), (702: 4), (744: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
