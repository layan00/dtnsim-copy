The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
967(7 to 5), 969(12 to 5), 974(8 to 4), 976(8 to 3), 977(10 to 7), 1003(3 to 7), 1021(11 to 1), 1023(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(967: 4), (969: 4), (977: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
