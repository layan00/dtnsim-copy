The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
940(7 to 5), 942(12 to 5), 948(8 to 4), 950(8 to 3), 951(10 to 7), 976(3 to 7), 998(11 to 1), 1004(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(951: 50.000000), (976: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(940: 2), (942: 4), (951: 5), (976: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
