The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
918(7 to 5), 920(12 to 5), 925(8 to 4), 927(8 to 3), 928(10 to 7), 952(3 to 7), 971(11 to 1), 974(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(974: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(918: 2), (920: 4), (928: 4), (971: 2), (974: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
