The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1197(7 to 5), 1199(12 to 5), 1205(8 to 4), 1207(8 to 3), 1208(10 to 7), 1235(3 to 7), 1252(11 to 1), 1255(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1197: 4), (1199: 4), (1205: 1), (1207: 8), (1208: 4), (1252: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
