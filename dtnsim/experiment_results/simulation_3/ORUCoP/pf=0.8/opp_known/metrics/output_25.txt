The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
156(7 to 5), 158(12 to 5), 162(8 to 4), 164(8 to 3), 165(10 to 7), 201(3 to 7), 216(11 to 1), 218(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(165: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(156: 2), (158: 4), (162: 2), (164: 2), (165: 10), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
