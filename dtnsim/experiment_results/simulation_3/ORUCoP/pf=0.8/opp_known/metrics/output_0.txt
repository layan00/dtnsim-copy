The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(7 to 5), 174(12 to 5), 178(8 to 4), 180(8 to 3), 181(10 to 7), 214(3 to 7), 239(11 to 1), 244(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(180: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 4), (174: 4), (178: 3), (180: 3), (181: 4), (214: 6), (239: 3), (244: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 555 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
