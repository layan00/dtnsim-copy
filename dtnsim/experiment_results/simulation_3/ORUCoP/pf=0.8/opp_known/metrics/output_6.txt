The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
432(7 to 5), 434(12 to 5), 440(8 to 4), 442(8 to 3), 443(10 to 7), 479(3 to 7), 496(11 to 1), 498(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(443: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(432: 4), (434: 4), (440: 2), (442: 2), (443: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
