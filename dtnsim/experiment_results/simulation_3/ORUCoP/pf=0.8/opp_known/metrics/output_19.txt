The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1144(7 to 5), 1146(12 to 5), 1150(8 to 4), 1152(8 to 3), 1153(10 to 7), 1176(3 to 7), 1195(11 to 1), 1201(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1153: 50.000000), (1176: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1144: 2), (1146: 4), (1153: 5), (1176: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
