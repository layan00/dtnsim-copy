The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
695(7 to 5), 697(12 to 5), 701(8 to 4), 703(8 to 3), 704(10 to 7), 731(3 to 7), 747(11 to 1), 749(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(703: 130.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(695: 3), (697: 4), (701: 1), (703: 10), (704: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
