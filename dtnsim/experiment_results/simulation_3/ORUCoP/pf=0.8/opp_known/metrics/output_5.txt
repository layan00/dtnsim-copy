The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(7 to 5), 175(12 to 5), 180(8 to 4), 182(8 to 3), 183(10 to 7), 207(3 to 7), 226(11 to 1), 229(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(226: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 2), (175: 4), (183: 2), (226: 3), (229: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
