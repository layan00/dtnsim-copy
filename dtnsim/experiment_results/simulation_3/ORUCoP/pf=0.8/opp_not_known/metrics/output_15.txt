The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
178(7 to 5), 184(12 to 5), 204(8 to 4), 207(8 to 3), 208(10 to 7), 236(3 to 7), 284(11 to 1), 290(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(184: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(178: 5), (184: 6), (208: 4), (284: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 114 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
