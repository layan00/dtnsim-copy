The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
883(7 to 5), 885(12 to 5), 902(8 to 4), 904(8 to 3), 905(10 to 7), 937(3 to 7), 977(11 to 1), 983(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(883: 2), (885: 4), (905: 2), (977: 4), (983: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 148 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
