The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1684(7 to 5), 1686(12 to 5), 1704(8 to 4), 1708(8 to 3), 1709(10 to 7), 1746(3 to 7), 1788(11 to 1), 1794(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1686: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1684: 2), (1686: 6), (1704: 2), (1708: 2), (1709: 2), (1788: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 130 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
