The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
881(7 to 5), 883(12 to 5), 901(8 to 4), 905(8 to 3), 906(10 to 7), 939(3 to 7), 985(11 to 1), 992(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(883: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(881: 2), (883: 6), (901: 1), (905: 1), (906: 2), (939: 5), (985: 4), (992: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 145 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
