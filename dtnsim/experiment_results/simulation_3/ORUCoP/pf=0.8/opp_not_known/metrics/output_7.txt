The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
928(7 to 5), 930(12 to 5), 947(8 to 4), 949(8 to 3), 950(10 to 7), 980(3 to 7), 1022(11 to 1), 1027(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(928: 2), (930: 4), (1022: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 187 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
