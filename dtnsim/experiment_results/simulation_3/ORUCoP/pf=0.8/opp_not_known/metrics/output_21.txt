The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
559(7 to 5), 563(12 to 5), 580(8 to 4), 582(8 to 3), 583(10 to 7), 615(3 to 7), 659(11 to 1), 665(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(563: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(559: 2), (563: 6), (583: 2), (659: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 87 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
