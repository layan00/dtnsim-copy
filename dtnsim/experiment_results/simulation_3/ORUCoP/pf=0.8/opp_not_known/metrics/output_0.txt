The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
176(7 to 5), 178(12 to 5), 194(8 to 4), 196(8 to 3), 197(10 to 7), 236(3 to 7), 283(11 to 1), 290(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(196: 90.000000), (197: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(176: 4), (178: 4), (194: 4), (196: 4), (197: 4), (236: 4), (283: 3), (290: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 177 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
