The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
177(7 to 5), 179(12 to 5), 196(8 to 4), 198(8 to 3), 199(10 to 7), 235(3 to 7), 279(11 to 1), 287(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(279: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(177: 2), (179: 6), (199: 7), (235: 3), (279: 5), (287: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 171 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
