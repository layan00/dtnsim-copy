The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1289(7 to 5), 1291(12 to 5), 1307(8 to 4), 1309(8 to 3), 1310(10 to 7), 1347(3 to 7), 1388(11 to 1), 1393(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1289: 3), (1291: 6), (1310: 4), (1347: 1), (1388: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 124 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
