The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
184(7 to 5), 188(12 to 5), 205(8 to 4), 207(8 to 3), 208(10 to 7), 243(3 to 7), 286(11 to 1), 293(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(293: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(184: 2), (188: 6), (208: 5), (243: 1), (286: 6), (293: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
