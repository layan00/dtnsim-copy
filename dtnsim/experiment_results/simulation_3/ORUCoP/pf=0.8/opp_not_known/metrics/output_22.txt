The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
930(7 to 5), 932(12 to 5), 948(8 to 4), 950(8 to 3), 951(10 to 7), 984(3 to 7), 1024(11 to 1), 1030(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(930: 3), (932: 4), (948: 1), (950: 1), (951: 2), (1024: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 157 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
