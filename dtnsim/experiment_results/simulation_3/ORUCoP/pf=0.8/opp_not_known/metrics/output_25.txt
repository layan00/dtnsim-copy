The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
160(7 to 5), 162(12 to 5), 178(8 to 4), 180(8 to 3), 181(10 to 7), 217(3 to 7), 256(11 to 1), 262(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(160: 2), (162: 4), (178: 2), (180: 2), (256: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
