The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
923(7 to 5), 925(12 to 5), 941(8 to 4), 943(8 to 3), 944(10 to 7), 974(3 to 7), 1014(11 to 1), 1020(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(943: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(923: 2), (925: 4), (941: 2), (943: 2), (1014: 4), (1020: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 177 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
