The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1642(7 to 5), 1648(12 to 5), 1666(8 to 4), 1672(8 to 3), 1673(10 to 7), 1708(3 to 7), 1749(11 to 1), 1755(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1648: 10.000000), (1672: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1642: 6), (1648: 6), (1666: 4), (1672: 4), (1673: 2), (1749: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 85 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
