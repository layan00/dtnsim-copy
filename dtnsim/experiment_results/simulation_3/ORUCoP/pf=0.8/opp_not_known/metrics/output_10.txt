The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
163(7 to 5), 165(12 to 5), 181(8 to 4), 183(8 to 3), 184(10 to 7), 214(3 to 7), 253(11 to 1), 259(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(163: 2), (165: 4), (184: 2), (253: 6), (259: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 169 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
