The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1303(7 to 5), 1305(12 to 5), 1322(8 to 4), 1324(8 to 3), 1325(10 to 7), 1361(3 to 7), 1404(11 to 1), 1412(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1303: 2), (1305: 4), (1325: 6), (1361: 2), (1404: 4), (1412: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 170 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
