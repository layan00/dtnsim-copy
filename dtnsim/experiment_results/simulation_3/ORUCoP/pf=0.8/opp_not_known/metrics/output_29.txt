The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1653(7 to 5), 1655(12 to 5), 1673(8 to 4), 1675(8 to 3), 1676(10 to 7), 1711(3 to 7), 1755(11 to 1), 1760(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1655: 50.000000), (1675: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1653: 2), (1655: 6), (1673: 4), (1675: 4), (1676: 2), (1755: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 145 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
