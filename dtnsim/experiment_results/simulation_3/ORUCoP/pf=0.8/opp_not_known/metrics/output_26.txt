The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
516(7 to 5), 518(12 to 5), 536(8 to 4), 538(8 to 3), 539(10 to 7), 572(3 to 7), 612(11 to 1), 618(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(516: 3), (518: 4), (539: 2), (612: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 160 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
