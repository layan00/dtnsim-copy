The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
569(7 to 5), 573(12 to 5), 591(8 to 4), 593(8 to 3), 594(10 to 7), 626(3 to 7), 668(11 to 1), 674(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(569: 2), (573: 5), (594: 2), (668: 6), (674: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
