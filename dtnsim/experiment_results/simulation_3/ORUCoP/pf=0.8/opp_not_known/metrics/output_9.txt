The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1656(7 to 5), 1658(12 to 5), 1676(8 to 4), 1678(8 to 3), 1679(10 to 7), 1710(3 to 7), 1751(11 to 1), 1756(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1656: 2), (1658: 4), (1676: 1), (1678: 1), (1679: 2), (1751: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 168 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
