The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1248(7 to 5), 1250(12 to 5), 1268(8 to 4), 1270(8 to 3), 1271(10 to 7), 1307(3 to 7), 1347(11 to 1), 1353(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1248: 4), (1250: 4), (1271: 2), (1347: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
