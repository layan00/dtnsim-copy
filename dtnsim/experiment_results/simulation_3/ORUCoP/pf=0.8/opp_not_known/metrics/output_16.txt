The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
537(7 to 5), 539(12 to 5), 555(8 to 4), 557(8 to 3), 558(10 to 7), 590(3 to 7), 629(11 to 1), 635(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(537: 2), (539: 4), (558: 2), (629: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 140 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
