The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
526(7 to 5), 528(12 to 5), 544(8 to 4), 546(8 to 3), 547(10 to 7), 576(3 to 7), 622(11 to 1), 627(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(528: 50.000000), (622: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(526: 2), (528: 6), (547: 2), (622: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 135 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
