The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
894(7 to 5), 896(12 to 5), 913(8 to 4), 917(8 to 3), 918(10 to 7), 951(3 to 7), 994(11 to 1), 1000(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(896: 10.000000), (994: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(894: 2), (896: 6), (918: 2), (994: 6), (1000: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 126 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
