The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1276(7 to 5), 1280(12 to 5), 1297(8 to 4), 1299(8 to 3), 1300(10 to 7), 1327(3 to 7), 1368(11 to 1), 1373(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1276: 2), (1280: 4), (1300: 2), (1368: 4), (1373: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 132 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
