The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1266(7 to 5), 1268(12 to 5), 1285(8 to 4), 1287(8 to 3), 1288(10 to 7), 1318(3 to 7), 1361(11 to 1), 1366(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1366: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1266: 2), (1268: 4), (1288: 2), (1361: 5), (1366: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 180 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
