The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
560(7 to 5), 566(12 to 5), 584(8 to 4), 588(8 to 3), 589(10 to 7), 623(3 to 7), 664(11 to 1), 670(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(560: 6), (566: 4), (584: 2), (588: 2), (664: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
