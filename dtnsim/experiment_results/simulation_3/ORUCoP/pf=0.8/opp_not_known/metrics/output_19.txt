The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1606(7 to 5), 1608(12 to 5), 1624(8 to 4), 1626(8 to 3), 1627(10 to 7), 1660(3 to 7), 1700(11 to 1), 1706(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1700: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1606: 2), (1608: 4), (1627: 2), (1700: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 137 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
