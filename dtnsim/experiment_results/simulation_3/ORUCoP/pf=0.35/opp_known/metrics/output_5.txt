The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(7 to 5), 219(12 to 5), 224(8 to 4), 226(8 to 3), 227(10 to 7), 267(3 to 7), 293(11 to 1), 297(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 50.000000), (224: 120.000000), (226: 90.000000), (227: 10.000000), (293: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 4), (219: 6), (224: 4), (226: 3), (227: 6), (267: 2), (293: 3), (297: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
