The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
235(7 to 5), 238(12 to 5), 244(8 to 4), 246(8 to 3), 247(10 to 7), 283(3 to 7), 313(11 to 1), 317(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 60.000000), (238: 50.000000), (247: 10.000000), (313: 80.000000), (317: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(235: 6), (238: 6), (247: 6), (283: 2), (313: 3), (317: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
