The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
575(7 to 5), 578(12 to 5), 583(8 to 4), 586(8 to 3), 587(10 to 7), 629(3 to 7), 659(11 to 1), 666(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(575: 60.000000), (578: 50.000000), (586: 70.000000), (587: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(575: 9), (578: 6), (583: 6), (586: 6), (587: 6), (659: 1), (666: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
