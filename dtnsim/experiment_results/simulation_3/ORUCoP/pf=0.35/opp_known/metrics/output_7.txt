The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
923(7 to 5), 926(12 to 5), 932(8 to 4), 935(8 to 3), 936(10 to 7), 966(3 to 7), 988(11 to 1), 991(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(932: 120.000000), (935: 90.000000), (936: 10.000000), (988: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(923: 7), (926: 4), (932: 3), (935: 6), (936: 4), (966: 1), (988: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
