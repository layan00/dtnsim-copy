The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
879(7 to 5), 881(12 to 5), 887(8 to 4), 889(8 to 3), 890(10 to 7), 927(3 to 7), 952(11 to 1), 955(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(890: 10.000000), (927: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(879: 8), (881: 4), (890: 4), (927: 3), (955: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
