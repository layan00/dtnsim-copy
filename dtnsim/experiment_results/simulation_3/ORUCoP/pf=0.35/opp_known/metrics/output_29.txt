The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1666(7 to 5), 1668(12 to 5), 1676(8 to 4), 1678(8 to 3), 1679(10 to 7), 1714(3 to 7), 1738(11 to 1), 1741(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1666: 60.000000), (1668: 50.000000), (1676: 120.000000), (1678: 90.000000), (1738: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1666: 5), (1668: 6), (1676: 6), (1678: 6), (1679: 2), (1738: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
