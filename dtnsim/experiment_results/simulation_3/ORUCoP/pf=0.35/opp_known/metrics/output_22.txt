The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
928(7 to 5), 930(12 to 5), 935(8 to 4), 937(8 to 3), 938(10 to 7), 974(3 to 7), 997(11 to 1), 1000(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(935: 120.000000), (937: 90.000000), (997: 80.000000), (1000: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(928: 8), (930: 4), (935: 3), (937: 6), (938: 2), (974: 1), (997: 3), (1000: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
