The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1612(7 to 5), 1614(12 to 5), 1620(8 to 4), 1622(8 to 3), 1623(10 to 7), 1659(3 to 7), 1684(11 to 1), 1691(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1622: 90.000000), (1623: 10.000000), (1691: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1612: 6), (1614: 2), (1620: 6), (1622: 6), (1623: 4), (1659: 1), (1684: 1), (1691: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
