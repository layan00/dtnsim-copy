The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
567(7 to 5), 570(12 to 5), 574(8 to 4), 576(8 to 3), 577(10 to 7), 604(3 to 7), 631(11 to 1), 634(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(570: 50.000000), (577: 10.000000), (631: 80.000000), (634: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(567: 3), (570: 6), (577: 4), (631: 3), (634: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
