The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1220(7 to 5), 1222(12 to 5), 1230(8 to 4), 1232(8 to 3), 1233(10 to 7), 1275(3 to 7), 1305(11 to 1), 1313(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1220: 60.000000), (1222: 50.000000), (1232: 130.000000), (1233: 10.000000), (1275: 55.000000), (1313: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1220: 10), (1222: 6), (1230: 5), (1232: 8), (1233: 3), (1275: 3), (1305: 1), (1313: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
