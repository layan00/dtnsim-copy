The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(7 to 5), 219(12 to 5), 226(8 to 4), 229(8 to 3), 230(10 to 7), 255(3 to 7), 280(11 to 1), 283(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 50.000000), (229: 130.000000), (230: 10.000000), (280: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 6), (219: 3), (226: 1), (229: 10), (230: 3), (280: 3), (283: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
