The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
545(7 to 5), 548(12 to 5), 554(8 to 4), 556(8 to 3), 557(10 to 7), 589(3 to 7), 613(11 to 1), 620(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(548: 50.000000), (556: 70.000000), (557: 10.000000), (589: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(545: 4), (548: 3), (554: 6), (556: 8), (557: 3), (589: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
