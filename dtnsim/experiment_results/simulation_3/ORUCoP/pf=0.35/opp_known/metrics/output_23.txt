The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1284(7 to 5), 1287(12 to 5), 1291(8 to 4), 1294(8 to 3), 1295(10 to 7), 1330(3 to 7), 1355(11 to 1), 1359(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1294: 90.000000), (1295: 10.000000), (1330: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1284: 6), (1287: 4), (1291: 2), (1294: 6), (1295: 6), (1330: 3), (1355: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
