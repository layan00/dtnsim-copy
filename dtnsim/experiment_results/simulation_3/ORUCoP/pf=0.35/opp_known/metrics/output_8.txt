The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1269(7 to 5), 1272(12 to 5), 1276(8 to 4), 1278(8 to 3), 1279(10 to 7), 1312(3 to 7), 1339(11 to 1), 1343(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1269: 60.000000), (1272: 50.000000), (1279: 10.000000), (1339: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1269: 6), (1272: 6), (1279: 3), (1312: 2), (1339: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
