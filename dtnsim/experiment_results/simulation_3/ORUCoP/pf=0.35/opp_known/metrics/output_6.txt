The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
573(7 to 5), 576(12 to 5), 584(8 to 4), 587(8 to 3), 588(10 to 7), 627(3 to 7), 657(11 to 1), 660(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(573: 60.000000), (576: 50.000000), (588: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(573: 9), (576: 6), (584: 2), (587: 2), (588: 4), (657: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
