The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
721(7 to 5), 723(12 to 5), 730(8 to 4), 732(8 to 3), 733(10 to 7), 756(3 to 7), 767(11 to 1), 772(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(733: 70.000000), (756: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(723: 4), (730: 2), (732: 2), (733: 5), (756: 3), (767: 1), (772: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
