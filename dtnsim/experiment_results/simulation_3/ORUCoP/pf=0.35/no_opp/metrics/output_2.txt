The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
445(7 to 5), 447(12 to 5), 453(8 to 4), 455(8 to 3), 456(10 to 7), 464(3 to 7), 476(11 to 1), 479(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(453: 120.000000), (455: 90.000000), (476: 80.000000), (479: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(453: 3), (455: 2), (456: 2), (476: 3), (479: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
