The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
570(7 to 5), 572(12 to 5), 577(8 to 4), 579(8 to 3), 580(10 to 7), 593(3 to 7), 606(11 to 1), 611(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(606: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 1), (580: 5), (593: 2), (606: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
