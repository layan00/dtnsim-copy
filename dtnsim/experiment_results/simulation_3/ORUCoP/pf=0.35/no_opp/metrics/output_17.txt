The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
363(7 to 5), 365(12 to 5), 372(8 to 4), 374(8 to 3), 375(10 to 7), 392(3 to 7), 404(11 to 1), 411(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(375: 50.000000), (392: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(365: 4), (375: 8), (392: 3), (411: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
