The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
88(7 to 5), 90(12 to 5), 96(8 to 4), 98(8 to 3), 99(10 to 7), 114(3 to 7), 132(11 to 1), 139(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(96: 120.000000), (98: 90.000000), (99: 50.000000), (132: 80.000000), (139: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(90: 2), (96: 6), (98: 4), (99: 8), (132: 3), (139: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
