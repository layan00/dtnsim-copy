The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
422(7 to 5), 424(12 to 5), 433(8 to 4), 435(8 to 3), 436(10 to 7), 448(3 to 7), 460(11 to 1), 466(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(433: 120.000000), (435: 90.000000), (460: 80.000000), (466: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(433: 3), (435: 2), (436: 6), (448: 2), (460: 3), (466: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
