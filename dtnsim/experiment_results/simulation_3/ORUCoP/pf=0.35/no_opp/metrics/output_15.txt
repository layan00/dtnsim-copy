The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(7 to 5), 86(12 to 5), 94(8 to 4), 97(8 to 3), 98(10 to 7), 102(3 to 7), 118(11 to 1), 125(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(98: 50.000000), (118: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(86: 2), (94: 1), (97: 1), (98: 8), (118: 3), (125: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 98: (to: 9, time: 80.000000),
