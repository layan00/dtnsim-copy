The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
260(7 to 5), 262(12 to 5), 267(8 to 4), 269(8 to 3), 270(10 to 7), 293(3 to 7), 308(11 to 1), 311(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(262: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(262: 8), (267: 3), (269: 2), (270: 2), (308: 1), (311: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
