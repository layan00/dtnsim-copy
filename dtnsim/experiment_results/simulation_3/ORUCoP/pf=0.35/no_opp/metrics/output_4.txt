The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
746(7 to 5), 748(12 to 5), 756(8 to 4), 758(8 to 3), 759(10 to 7), 779(3 to 7), 789(11 to 1), 793(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(756: 120.000000), (758: 90.000000), (759: 70.000000), (779: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(748: 4), (756: 5), (758: 4), (759: 6), (779: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
