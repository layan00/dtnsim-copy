The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
556(7 to 5), 558(12 to 5), 564(8 to 4), 566(8 to 3), 567(10 to 7), 586(3 to 7), 602(11 to 1), 606(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(564: 120.000000), (566: 90.000000), (567: 70.000000), (606: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(558: 2), (564: 5), (566: 4), (567: 5), (602: 2), (606: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
