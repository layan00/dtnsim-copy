The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
103(7 to 5), 105(12 to 5), 111(8 to 4), 113(8 to 3), 114(10 to 7), 134(3 to 7), 151(11 to 1), 158(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(105: 50.000000), (151: 80.000000), (158: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(105: 8), (114: 7), (134: 2), (151: 3), (158: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
