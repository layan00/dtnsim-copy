The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
256(7 to 5), 258(12 to 5), 266(8 to 4), 268(8 to 3), 269(10 to 7), 291(3 to 7), 308(11 to 1), 312(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(258: 50.000000), (269: 70.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(258: 8), (266: 2), (268: 2), (269: 5), (308: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
