The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
415(7 to 5), 417(12 to 5), 423(8 to 4), 426(8 to 3), 427(10 to 7), 442(3 to 7), 453(11 to 1), 459(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(423: 120.000000), (426: 90.000000), (427: 50.000000), (453: 80.000000), (459: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(417: 3), (423: 3), (426: 2), (427: 7), (442: 1), (453: 3), (459: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
