The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(7 to 5), 224(12 to 5), 230(8 to 4), 232(8 to 3), 233(10 to 7), 249(3 to 7), 259(11 to 1), 263(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(233: 70.000000), (249: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(230: 3), (232: 2), (233: 6), (249: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
