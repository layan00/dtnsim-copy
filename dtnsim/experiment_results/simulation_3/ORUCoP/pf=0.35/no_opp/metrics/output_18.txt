The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
520(7 to 5), 522(12 to 5), 531(8 to 4), 533(8 to 3), 534(10 to 7), 556(3 to 7), 570(11 to 1), 576(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(522: 50.000000), (534: 70.000000), (556: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(522: 5), (531: 3), (533: 2), (534: 7), (556: 3), (570: 1), (576: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
