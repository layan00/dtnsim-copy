The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
752(7 to 5), 754(12 to 5), 761(8 to 4), 763(8 to 3), 764(10 to 7), 783(3 to 7), 799(11 to 1), 804(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(764: 70.000000), (783: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(754: 3), (761: 3), (763: 2), (764: 6), (783: 3), (799: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
