The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
755(7 to 5), 757(12 to 5), 766(8 to 4), 769(8 to 3), 770(10 to 7), 787(3 to 7), 797(11 to 1), 800(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(757: 50.000000), (766: 120.000000), (769: 90.000000), (797: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(757: 4), (766: 6), (769: 4), (770: 3), (797: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
