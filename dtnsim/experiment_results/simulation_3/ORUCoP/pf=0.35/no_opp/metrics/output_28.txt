The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
591(7 to 5), 593(12 to 5), 600(8 to 4), 602(8 to 3), 603(10 to 7), 618(3 to 7), 633(11 to 1), 638(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(603: 70.000000), (618: 55.000000), (633: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(593: 1), (600: 3), (602: 2), (603: 5), (618: 3), (633: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
