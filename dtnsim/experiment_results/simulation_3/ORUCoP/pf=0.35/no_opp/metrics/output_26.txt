The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
262(7 to 5), 264(12 to 5), 272(8 to 4), 275(8 to 3), 276(10 to 7), 299(3 to 7), 313(11 to 1), 315(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(264: 50.000000), (272: 120.000000), (275: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(264: 8), (272: 5), (275: 4), (276: 4), (299: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
