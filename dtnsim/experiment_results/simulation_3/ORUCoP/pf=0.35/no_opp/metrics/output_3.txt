The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
589(7 to 5), 591(12 to 5), 597(8 to 4), 599(8 to 3), 600(10 to 7), 617(3 to 7), 629(11 to 1), 633(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(617: 55.000000), (629: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(591: 4), (597: 3), (599: 2), (617: 3), (629: 3), (633: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
