The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
115(7 to 5), 121(12 to 5), 132(8 to 4), 137(8 to 3), 138(10 to 7), 160(3 to 7), 174(11 to 1), 181(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(132: 120.000000), (137: 90.000000), (174: 80.000000), (181: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(115: 8), (121: 6), (132: 6), (137: 4), (138: 6), (160: 4), (174: 3), (181: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 80 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
