The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
684(7 to 5), 686(12 to 5), 693(8 to 4), 695(8 to 3), 696(10 to 7), 712(3 to 7), 729(11 to 1), 737(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(695: 90.000000), (696: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(693: 4), (695: 4), (696: 8), (712: 2), (729: 1), (737: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
