The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
99(7 to 5), 101(12 to 5), 111(8 to 4), 114(8 to 3), 115(10 to 7), 134(3 to 7), 150(11 to 1), 152(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(101: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(101: 8), (111: 3), (114: 2), (115: 3), (134: 1), (152: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
