The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
85(7 to 5), 87(12 to 5), 93(8 to 4), 95(8 to 3), 96(10 to 7), 116(3 to 7), 127(11 to 1), 133(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(93: 120.000000), (95: 90.000000), (127: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(87: 2), (93: 6), (95: 4), (96: 6), (116: 2), (127: 3), (133: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
