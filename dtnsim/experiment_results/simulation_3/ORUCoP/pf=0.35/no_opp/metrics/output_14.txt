The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
708(7 to 5), 710(12 to 5), 716(8 to 4), 718(8 to 3), 719(10 to 7), 735(3 to 7), 746(11 to 1), 749(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(718: 90.000000), (749: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(716: 4), (718: 4), (719: 3), (735: 1), (746: 1), (749: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 749: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
