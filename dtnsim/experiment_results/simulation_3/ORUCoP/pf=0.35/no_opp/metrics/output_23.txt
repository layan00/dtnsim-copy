The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
583(7 to 5), 585(12 to 5), 590(8 to 4), 593(8 to 3), 594(10 to 7), 610(3 to 7), 622(11 to 1), 627(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(593: 90.000000), (594: 70.000000), (610: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(585: 4), (590: 2), (593: 2), (594: 6), (610: 3), (622: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
