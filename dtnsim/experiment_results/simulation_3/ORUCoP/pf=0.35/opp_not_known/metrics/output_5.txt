The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(7 to 5), 223(12 to 5), 242(8 to 4), 246(8 to 3), 247(10 to 7), 294(3 to 7), 345(11 to 1), 355(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 10.000000), (242: 120.000000), (246: 90.000000), (294: 35.000000), (345: 80.000000), (355: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 4), (223: 6), (242: 6), (246: 4), (247: 7), (294: 8), (345: 5), (355: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 143 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
