The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(7 to 5), 226(12 to 5), 246(8 to 4), 248(8 to 3), 249(10 to 7), 290(3 to 7), 349(11 to 1), 359(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(226: 50.000000), (246: 120.000000), (248: 90.000000), (249: 50.000000), (290: 35.000000), (349: 20.000000), (359: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 4), (226: 6), (246: 6), (248: 6), (249: 7), (290: 6), (349: 5), (359: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
