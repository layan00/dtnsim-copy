The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
715(7 to 5), 719(12 to 5), 738(8 to 4), 741(8 to 3), 742(10 to 7), 789(3 to 7), 839(11 to 1), 845(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(719: 50.000000), (738: 120.000000), (741: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(715: 5), (719: 7), (738: 5), (741: 4), (742: 4), (789: 1), (839: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 169 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
