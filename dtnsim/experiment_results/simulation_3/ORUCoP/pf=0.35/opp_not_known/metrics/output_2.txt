The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1187(7 to 5), 1189(12 to 5), 1209(8 to 4), 1211(8 to 3), 1212(10 to 7), 1253(3 to 7), 1304(11 to 1), 1309(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1187: 60.000000), (1189: 50.000000), (1209: 120.000000), (1211: 90.000000), (1304: 20.000000), (1309: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1187: 10), (1189: 6), (1209: 3), (1211: 2), (1212: 2), (1304: 5), (1309: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
