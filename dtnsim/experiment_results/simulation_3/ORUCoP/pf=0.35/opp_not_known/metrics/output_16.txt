The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
665(7 to 5), 669(12 to 5), 687(8 to 4), 689(8 to 3), 690(10 to 7), 732(3 to 7), 780(11 to 1), 788(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(669: 50.000000), (690: 70.000000), (732: 55.000000), (780: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(665: 2), (669: 7), (687: 3), (689: 2), (690: 8), (732: 3), (780: 6), (788: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
