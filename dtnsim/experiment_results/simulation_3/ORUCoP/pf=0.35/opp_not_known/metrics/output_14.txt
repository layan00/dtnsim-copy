The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2094(7 to 5), 2096(12 to 5), 2116(8 to 4), 2120(8 to 3), 2121(10 to 7), 2166(3 to 7), 2213(11 to 1), 2218(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2096: 10.000000), (2120: 90.000000), (2218: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2094: 6), (2096: 6), (2116: 4), (2120: 4), (2121: 2), (2166: 1), (2213: 3), (2218: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 135 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
