The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1641(7 to 5), 1647(12 to 5), 1663(8 to 4), 1665(8 to 3), 1666(10 to 7), 1703(3 to 7), 1759(11 to 1), 1766(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1647: 50.000000), (1759: 20.000000), (1766: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1641: 8), (1647: 4), (1666: 8), (1703: 7), (1759: 5), (1766: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 148 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
