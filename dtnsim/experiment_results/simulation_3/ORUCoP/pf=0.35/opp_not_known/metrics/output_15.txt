The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(7 to 5), 226(12 to 5), 245(8 to 4), 248(8 to 3), 249(10 to 7), 278(3 to 7), 332(11 to 1), 341(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(226: 50.000000), (249: 50.000000), (332: 20.000000), (341: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 7), (226: 4), (245: 1), (248: 1), (249: 8), (332: 5), (341: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
