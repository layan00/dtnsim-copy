The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2103(7 to 5), 2105(12 to 5), 2124(8 to 4), 2126(8 to 3), 2127(10 to 7), 2177(3 to 7), 2224(11 to 1), 2230(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2230: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2103: 6), (2105: 4), (2124: 2), (2126: 2), (2127: 2), (2177: 3), (2224: 3), (2230: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 143 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
