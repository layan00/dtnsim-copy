The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
712(7 to 5), 716(12 to 5), 733(8 to 4), 736(8 to 3), 737(10 to 7), 782(3 to 7), 833(11 to 1), 838(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(716: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(712: 5), (716: 7), (733: 3), (736: 2), (737: 2), (833: 3), (838: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 175 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
