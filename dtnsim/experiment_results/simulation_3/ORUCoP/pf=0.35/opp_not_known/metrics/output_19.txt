The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2066(7 to 5), 2070(12 to 5), 2089(8 to 4), 2092(8 to 3), 2093(10 to 7), 2136(3 to 7), 2194(11 to 1), 2204(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2092: 90.000000), (2093: 50.000000), (2194: 20.000000), (2204: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2066: 5), (2070: 6), (2089: 4), (2092: 4), (2093: 8), (2136: 7), (2194: 4), (2204: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 220 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
