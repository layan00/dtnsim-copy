The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1190(7 to 5), 1194(12 to 5), 1212(8 to 4), 1215(8 to 3), 1216(10 to 7), 1253(3 to 7), 1298(11 to 1), 1303(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1212: 120.000000), (1215: 90.000000), (1298: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1190: 5), (1194: 3), (1212: 3), (1215: 2), (1216: 4), (1253: 1), (1298: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 167 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
