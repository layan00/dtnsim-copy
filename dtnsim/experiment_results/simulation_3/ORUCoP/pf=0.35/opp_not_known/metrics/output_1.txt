The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
736(7 to 5), 742(12 to 5), 760(8 to 4), 763(8 to 3), 764(10 to 7), 803(3 to 7), 852(11 to 1), 862(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(742: 50.000000), (764: 50.000000), (803: 55.000000), (852: 20.000000), (862: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(736: 5), (742: 4), (760: 1), (763: 1), (764: 8), (803: 3), (852: 4), (862: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 106 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
