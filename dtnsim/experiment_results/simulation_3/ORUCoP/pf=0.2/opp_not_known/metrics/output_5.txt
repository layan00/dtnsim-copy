The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(7 to 5), 255(12 to 5), 271(8 to 4), 273(8 to 3), 274(10 to 7), 329(3 to 7), 386(11 to 1), 397(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 60.000000), (255: 50.000000), (271: 120.000000), (273: 90.000000), (274: 50.000000), (329: 35.000000), (386: 80.000000), (397: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 14), (255: 8), (271: 4), (273: 3), (274: 9), (329: 8), (386: 5), (397: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 134 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
