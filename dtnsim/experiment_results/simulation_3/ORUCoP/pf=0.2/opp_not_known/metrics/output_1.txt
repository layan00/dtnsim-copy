The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
767(7 to 5), 773(12 to 5), 794(8 to 4), 798(8 to 3), 799(10 to 7), 841(3 to 7), 894(11 to 1), 903(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(767: 60.000000), (773: 50.000000), (799: 50.000000), (841: 55.000000), (894: 80.000000), (903: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(767: 7), (773: 9), (794: 4), (798: 1), (799: 8), (841: 3), (894: 5), (903: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
