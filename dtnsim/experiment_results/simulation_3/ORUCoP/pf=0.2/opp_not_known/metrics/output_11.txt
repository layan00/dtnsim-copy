The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
722(7 to 5), 726(12 to 5), 746(8 to 4), 751(8 to 3), 752(10 to 7), 789(3 to 7), 844(11 to 1), 852(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(722: 40.000000), (726: 50.000000), (752: 50.000000), (789: 35.000000), (844: 80.000000), (852: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(722: 10), (726: 6), (752: 4), (789: 6), (844: 5), (852: 11), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
