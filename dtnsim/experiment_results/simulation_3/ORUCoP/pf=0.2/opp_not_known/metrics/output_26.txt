The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
770(7 to 5), 778(12 to 5), 796(8 to 4), 798(8 to 3), 799(10 to 7), 855(3 to 7), 914(11 to 1), 927(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(770: 60.000000), (778: 50.000000), (796: 120.000000), (798: 90.000000), (799: 50.000000), (855: 35.000000), (927: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(770: 14), (778: 8), (796: 6), (798: 6), (799: 9), (855: 8), (914: 4), (927: 10), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 152 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
