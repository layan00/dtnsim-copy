The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
241(7 to 5), 243(12 to 5), 264(8 to 4), 267(8 to 3), 268(10 to 7), 318(3 to 7), 372(11 to 1), 376(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 60.000000), (243: 50.000000), (264: 120.000000), (267: 90.000000), (376: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(241: 10), (243: 9), (264: 3), (267: 6), (268: 2), (372: 3), (376: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 124 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
