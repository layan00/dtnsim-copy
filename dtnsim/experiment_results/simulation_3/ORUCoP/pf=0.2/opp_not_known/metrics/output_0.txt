The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
257(7 to 5), 265(12 to 5), 284(8 to 4), 286(8 to 3), 287(10 to 7), 336(3 to 7), 393(11 to 1), 400(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(257: 60.000000), (265: 50.000000), (284: 120.000000), (286: 90.000000), (287: 70.000000), (336: 55.000000), (393: 80.000000), (400: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(257: 12), (265: 6), (284: 6), (286: 6), (287: 7), (336: 7), (393: 5), (400: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 119 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
