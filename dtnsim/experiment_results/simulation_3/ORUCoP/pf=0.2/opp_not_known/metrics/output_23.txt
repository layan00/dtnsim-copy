The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1777(7 to 5), 1785(12 to 5), 1800(8 to 4), 1802(8 to 3), 1803(10 to 7), 1849(3 to 7), 1900(11 to 1), 1906(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1800: 120.000000), (1802: 90.000000), (1803: 70.000000), (1849: 55.000000), (1906: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1777: 8), (1785: 2), (1800: 6), (1802: 6), (1803: 8), (1849: 3), (1900: 4), (1906: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 157 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
