The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1798(7 to 5), 1810(12 to 5), 1826(8 to 4), 1830(8 to 3), 1831(10 to 7), 1879(3 to 7), 1935(11 to 1), 1942(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1798: 20.000000), (1810: 50.000000), (1826: 120.000000), (1830: 90.000000), (1942: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1798: 13), (1810: 6), (1826: 6), (1830: 6), (1831: 7), (1879: 7), (1935: 4), (1942: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 125 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
