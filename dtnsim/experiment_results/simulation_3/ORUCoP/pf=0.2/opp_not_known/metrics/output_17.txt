The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1228(7 to 5), 1236(12 to 5), 1253(8 to 4), 1255(8 to 3), 1256(10 to 7), 1310(3 to 7), 1369(11 to 1), 1381(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1228: 60.000000), (1236: 50.000000), (1255: 90.000000), (1256: 50.000000), (1310: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1228: 14), (1236: 8), (1253: 2), (1255: 6), (1256: 8), (1310: 8), (1369: 3), (1381: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 137 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
