The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1797(7 to 5), 1805(12 to 5), 1821(8 to 4), 1823(8 to 3), 1824(10 to 7), 1873(3 to 7), 1928(11 to 1), 1937(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1797: 60.000000), (1805: 50.000000), (1824: 50.000000), (1873: 55.000000), (1928: 80.000000), (1937: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1797: 12), (1805: 6), (1821: 2), (1823: 2), (1824: 8), (1873: 3), (1928: 5), (1937: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 123 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
