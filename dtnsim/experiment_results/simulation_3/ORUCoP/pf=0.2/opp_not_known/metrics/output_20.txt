The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
257(7 to 5), 265(12 to 5), 282(8 to 4), 284(8 to 3), 285(10 to 7), 338(3 to 7), 400(11 to 1), 411(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(257: 60.000000), (265: 50.000000), (282: 120.000000), (284: 90.000000), (285: 50.000000), (338: 35.000000), (400: 80.000000), (411: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(257: 14), (265: 8), (282: 6), (284: 6), (285: 8), (338: 8), (400: 5), (411: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 144 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
