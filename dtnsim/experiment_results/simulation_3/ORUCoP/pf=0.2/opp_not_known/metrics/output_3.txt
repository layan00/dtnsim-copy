The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1769(7 to 5), 1777(12 to 5), 1793(8 to 4), 1795(8 to 3), 1796(10 to 7), 1845(3 to 7), 1900(11 to 1), 1907(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1795: 130.000000), (1845: 35.000000), (1900: 80.000000), (1907: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1769: 12), (1777: 6), (1793: 4), (1795: 10), (1796: 1), (1845: 9), (1900: 4), (1907: 12), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 221 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
