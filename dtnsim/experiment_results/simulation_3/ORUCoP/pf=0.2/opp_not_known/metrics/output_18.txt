The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1744(7 to 5), 1752(12 to 5), 1770(8 to 4), 1772(8 to 3), 1773(10 to 7), 1827(3 to 7), 1886(11 to 1), 1896(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1744: 60.000000), (1752: 50.000000), (1772: 90.000000), (1773: 70.000000), (1827: 35.000000), (1886: 20.000000), (1896: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1744: 14), (1752: 8), (1770: 5), (1772: 6), (1773: 7), (1827: 8), (1886: 4), (1896: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 133 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
