The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
764(7 to 5), 776(12 to 5), 794(8 to 4), 798(8 to 3), 799(10 to 7), 846(3 to 7), 907(11 to 1), 918(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(764: 20.000000), (776: 50.000000), (798: 130.000000), (799: 50.000000), (846: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(764: 13), (776: 8), (794: 4), (798: 6), (799: 8), (846: 8), (907: 3), (918: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 157 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
