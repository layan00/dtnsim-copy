The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(7 to 5), 251(12 to 5), 274(8 to 4), 279(8 to 3), 280(10 to 7), 320(3 to 7), 372(11 to 1), 380(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(245: 60.000000), (251: 10.000000), (279: 130.000000), (280: 50.000000), (372: 80.000000), (380: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 9), (251: 6), (274: 4), (279: 6), (280: 8), (372: 5), (380: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 136 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
