The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1276(7 to 5), 1278(12 to 5), 1298(8 to 4), 1301(8 to 3), 1302(10 to 7), 1350(3 to 7), 1405(11 to 1), 1412(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1276: 60.000000), (1278: 10.000000), (1298: 120.000000), (1301: 90.000000), (1302: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1276: 10), (1278: 5), (1298: 6), (1301: 6), (1302: 7), (1350: 5), (1405: 4), (1412: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 130 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
