The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
251(7 to 5), 259(12 to 5), 278(8 to 4), 280(8 to 3), 281(10 to 7), 336(3 to 7), 395(11 to 1), 404(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(251: 60.000000), (259: 50.000000), (280: 130.000000), (281: 50.000000), (336: 35.000000), (404: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(251: 14), (259: 8), (278: 3), (280: 10), (281: 7), (336: 7), (395: 2), (404: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 158 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
