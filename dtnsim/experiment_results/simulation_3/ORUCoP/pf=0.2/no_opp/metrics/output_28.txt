The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
699(7 to 5), 701(12 to 5), 708(8 to 4), 710(8 to 3), 711(10 to 7), 726(3 to 7), 743(11 to 1), 751(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(711: 50.000000), (726: 55.000000), (743: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(701: 1), (708: 2), (710: 2), (711: 8), (726: 3), (743: 3), (751: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
