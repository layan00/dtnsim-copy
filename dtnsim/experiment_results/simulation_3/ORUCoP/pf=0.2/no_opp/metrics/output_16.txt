The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
284(7 to 5), 286(12 to 5), 293(8 to 4), 295(8 to 3), 296(10 to 7), 317(3 to 7), 329(11 to 1), 333(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(295: 90.000000), (296: 70.000000), (317: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(286: 4), (293: 4), (295: 4), (296: 6), (317: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
