The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
323(7 to 5), 325(12 to 5), 334(8 to 4), 337(8 to 3), 338(10 to 7), 361(3 to 7), 377(11 to 1), 383(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(325: 50.000000), (338: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(325: 8), (334: 3), (337: 3), (338: 7), (361: 1), (377: 1), (383: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
