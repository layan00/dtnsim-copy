The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
339(7 to 5), 341(12 to 5), 349(8 to 4), 352(8 to 3), 353(10 to 7), 372(3 to 7), 388(11 to 1), 396(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(341: 50.000000), (353: 50.000000), (372: 55.000000), (388: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(341: 8), (349: 3), (352: 1), (353: 8), (372: 3), (388: 3), (396: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
