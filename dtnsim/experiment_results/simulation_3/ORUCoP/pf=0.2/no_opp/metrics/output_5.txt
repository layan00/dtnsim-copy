The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
111(7 to 5), 113(12 to 5), 120(8 to 4), 122(8 to 3), 123(10 to 7), 145(3 to 7), 159(11 to 1), 167(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(113: 50.000000), (120: 120.000000), (122: 90.000000), (123: 50.000000), (159: 80.000000), (167: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(113: 5), (120: 4), (122: 3), (123: 8), (145: 2), (159: 3), (167: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
