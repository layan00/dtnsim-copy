The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
894(7 to 5), 896(12 to 5), 903(8 to 4), 905(8 to 3), 906(10 to 7), 931(3 to 7), 943(11 to 1), 948(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(906: 70.000000), (931: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(896: 6), (903: 3), (905: 3), (906: 5), (931: 3), (943: 1), (948: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
