The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
121(7 to 5), 123(12 to 5), 131(8 to 4), 134(8 to 3), 135(10 to 7), 157(3 to 7), 176(11 to 1), 184(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(123: 50.000000), (131: 120.000000), (134: 90.000000), (135: 50.000000), (157: 55.000000), (176: 80.000000), (184: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(123: 8), (131: 5), (134: 4), (135: 8), (157: 3), (176: 3), (184: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
