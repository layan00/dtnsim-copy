The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
710(7 to 5), 712(12 to 5), 719(8 to 4), 721(8 to 3), 722(10 to 7), 741(3 to 7), 756(11 to 1), 762(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(719: 120.000000), (721: 90.000000), (756: 80.000000), (762: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(712: 1), (719: 5), (721: 4), (722: 6), (741: 2), (756: 3), (762: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
