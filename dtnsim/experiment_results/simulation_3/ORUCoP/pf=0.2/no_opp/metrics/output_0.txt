The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
121(7 to 5), 127(12 to 5), 138(8 to 4), 143(8 to 3), 144(10 to 7), 166(3 to 7), 185(11 to 1), 193(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(121: 60.000000), (127: 50.000000), (138: 120.000000), (143: 90.000000), (144: 70.000000), (166: 55.000000), (185: 80.000000), (193: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(121: 10), (127: 8), (138: 5), (143: 4), (144: 7), (166: 5), (185: 6), (193: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 83 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
