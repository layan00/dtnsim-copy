The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
312(7 to 5), 314(12 to 5), 323(8 to 4), 326(8 to 3), 327(10 to 7), 351(3 to 7), 368(11 to 1), 375(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(314: 50.000000), (323: 120.000000), (326: 90.000000), (327: 50.000000), (351: 55.000000), (375: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(314: 8), (323: 5), (326: 4), (327: 8), (351: 3), (375: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
