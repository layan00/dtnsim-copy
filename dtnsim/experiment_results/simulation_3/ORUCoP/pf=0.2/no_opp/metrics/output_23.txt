The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
707(7 to 5), 709(12 to 5), 715(8 to 4), 718(8 to 3), 719(10 to 7), 739(3 to 7), 754(11 to 1), 759(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(715: 120.000000), (718: 90.000000), (719: 70.000000), (739: 55.000000), (754: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(709: 4), (715: 5), (718: 4), (719: 6), (739: 3), (754: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
