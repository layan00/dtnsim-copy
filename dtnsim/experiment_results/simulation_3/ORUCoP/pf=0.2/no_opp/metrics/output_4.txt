The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
891(7 to 5), 893(12 to 5), 901(8 to 4), 903(8 to 3), 904(10 to 7), 923(3 to 7), 934(11 to 1), 939(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(901: 120.000000), (903: 90.000000), (904: 70.000000), (923: 55.000000), (934: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(893: 4), (901: 5), (903: 4), (904: 6), (923: 3), (934: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
