The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
441(7 to 5), 443(12 to 5), 451(8 to 4), 454(8 to 3), 455(10 to 7), 469(3 to 7), 486(11 to 1), 494(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(455: 50.000000), (486: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(443: 4), (451: 3), (454: 1), (455: 8), (469: 2), (486: 3), (494: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
