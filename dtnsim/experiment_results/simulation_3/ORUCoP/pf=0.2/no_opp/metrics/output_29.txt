The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
892(7 to 5), 894(12 to 5), 904(8 to 4), 907(8 to 3), 908(10 to 7), 932(3 to 7), 949(11 to 1), 955(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(894: 50.000000), (904: 120.000000), (907: 90.000000), (908: 50.000000), (949: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(894: 8), (904: 5), (907: 4), (908: 7), (932: 1), (949: 3), (955: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
