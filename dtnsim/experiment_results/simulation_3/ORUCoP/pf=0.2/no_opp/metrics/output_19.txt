The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
852(7 to 5), 854(12 to 5), 864(8 to 4), 867(8 to 3), 868(10 to 7), 885(3 to 7), 901(11 to 1), 909(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(867: 90.000000), (868: 50.000000), (885: 55.000000), (909: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(854: 3), (864: 4), (867: 4), (868: 8), (885: 3), (901: 1), (909: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
