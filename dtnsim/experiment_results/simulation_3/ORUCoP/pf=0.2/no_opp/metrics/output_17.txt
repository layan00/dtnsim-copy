The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
462(7 to 5), 464(12 to 5), 472(8 to 4), 474(8 to 3), 475(10 to 7), 496(3 to 7), 512(11 to 1), 520(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(464: 50.000000), (474: 90.000000), (475: 50.000000), (496: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(464: 5), (472: 2), (474: 4), (475: 8), (496: 3), (512: 1), (520: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
