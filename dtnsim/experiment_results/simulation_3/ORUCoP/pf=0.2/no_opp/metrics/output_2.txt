The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
529(7 to 5), 531(12 to 5), 539(8 to 4), 541(8 to 3), 542(10 to 7), 553(3 to 7), 566(11 to 1), 570(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(539: 120.000000), (541: 90.000000), (542: 70.000000), (566: 80.000000), (570: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(531: 1), (539: 5), (541: 2), (542: 5), (566: 3), (570: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
