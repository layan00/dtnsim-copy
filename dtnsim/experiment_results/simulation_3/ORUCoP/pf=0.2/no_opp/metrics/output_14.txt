The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
836(7 to 5), 838(12 to 5), 847(8 to 4), 849(8 to 3), 850(10 to 7), 875(3 to 7), 891(11 to 1), 898(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(838: 50.000000), (849: 90.000000), (850: 70.000000), (875: 55.000000), (898: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(838: 8), (847: 4), (849: 4), (850: 8), (875: 3), (891: 1), (898: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
