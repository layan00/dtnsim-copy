The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
506(7 to 5), 508(12 to 5), 517(8 to 4), 519(8 to 3), 520(10 to 7), 533(3 to 7), 549(11 to 1), 555(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 120.000000), (519: 90.000000), (549: 80.000000), (555: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(517: 5), (519: 2), (520: 6), (533: 2), (549: 3), (555: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
