The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
278(7 to 5), 280(12 to 5), 287(8 to 4), 289(8 to 3), 290(10 to 7), 298(3 to 7), 312(11 to 1), 315(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(312: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(280: 2), (290: 2), (312: 3), (315: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 315: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 312: (to: 4, time: 140.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 312: (to: 1, time: 160.000000), 
Bundle 315: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 290: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 60.000000), 
Node 11: 
Bundle 312: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 12: 
Bundle 280: (to: 2, time: 10.000000), (to: 11, time: 40.000000),
