The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
512(7 to 5), 514(12 to 5), 521(8 to 4), 524(8 to 3), 525(10 to 7), 543(3 to 7), 557(11 to 1), 563(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(514: 50.000000), (521: 120.000000), (524: 90.000000), (525: 50.000000), (557: 80.000000), (563: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(514: 4), (521: 5), (524: 4), (525: 7), (543: 1), (557: 3), (563: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
