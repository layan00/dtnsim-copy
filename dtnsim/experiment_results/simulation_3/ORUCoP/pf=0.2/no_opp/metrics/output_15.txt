The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
109(7 to 5), 111(12 to 5), 121(8 to 4), 124(8 to 3), 125(10 to 7), 140(3 to 7), 155(11 to 1), 159(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(111: 50.000000), (125: 70.000000), (155: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(111: 4), (121: 3), (124: 3), (125: 5), (155: 3), (159: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
