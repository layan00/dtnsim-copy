The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
308(7 to 5), 310(12 to 5), 318(8 to 4), 320(8 to 3), 321(10 to 7), 344(3 to 7), 364(11 to 1), 372(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(310: 50.000000), (321: 50.000000), (344: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(310: 8), (318: 3), (320: 3), (321: 8), (344: 3), (364: 1), (372: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
