The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
715(7 to 5), 717(12 to 5), 724(8 to 4), 726(8 to 3), 727(10 to 7), 743(3 to 7), 758(11 to 1), 762(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(743: 55.000000), (758: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(717: 4), (724: 3), (726: 3), (743: 3), (758: 3), (762: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
