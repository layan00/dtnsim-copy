The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
634(7 to 5), 636(12 to 5), 644(8 to 4), 647(8 to 3), 648(10 to 7), 672(3 to 7), 690(11 to 1), 696(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(636: 50.000000), (644: 120.000000), (647: 90.000000), (648: 70.000000), (672: 55.000000), (696: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 8), (644: 3), (647: 4), (648: 7), (672: 3), (690: 2), (696: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
