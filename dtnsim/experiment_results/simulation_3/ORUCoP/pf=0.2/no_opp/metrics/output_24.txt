The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
918(7 to 5), 920(12 to 5), 930(8 to 4), 933(8 to 3), 934(10 to 7), 958(3 to 7), 975(11 to 1), 980(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(920: 50.000000), (930: 120.000000), (933: 90.000000), (934: 70.000000), (958: 55.000000), (975: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(920: 8), (930: 5), (933: 4), (934: 6), (958: 3), (975: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
