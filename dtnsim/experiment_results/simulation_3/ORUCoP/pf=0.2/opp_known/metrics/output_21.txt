The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
639(7 to 5), 642(12 to 5), 650(8 to 4), 653(8 to 3), 654(10 to 7), 697(3 to 7), 729(11 to 1), 736(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(639: 60.000000), (642: 50.000000), (653: 70.000000), (654: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(639: 9), (642: 6), (650: 6), (653: 8), (654: 6), (697: 1), (729: 1), (736: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
