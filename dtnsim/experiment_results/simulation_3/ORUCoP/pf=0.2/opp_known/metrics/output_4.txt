The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1801(7 to 5), 1804(12 to 5), 1812(8 to 4), 1815(8 to 3), 1816(10 to 7), 1852(3 to 7), 1879(11 to 1), 1887(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1804: 50.000000), (1812: 120.000000), (1815: 70.000000), (1816: 10.000000), (1852: 55.000000), (1879: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1801: 7), (1804: 6), (1812: 9), (1815: 6), (1816: 3), (1852: 3), (1879: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
