The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
241(7 to 5), 244(12 to 5), 253(8 to 4), 256(8 to 3), 257(10 to 7), 292(3 to 7), 322(11 to 1), 329(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(244: 50.000000), (253: 120.000000), (256: 70.000000), (257: 10.000000), (322: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(241: 6), (244: 6), (253: 7), (256: 8), (257: 3), (322: 3), (329: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
