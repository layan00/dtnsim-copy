The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
628(7 to 5), 631(12 to 5), 639(8 to 4), 642(8 to 3), 643(10 to 7), 683(3 to 7), 718(11 to 1), 726(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(628: 60.000000), (631: 50.000000), (642: 70.000000), (643: 10.000000), (683: 55.000000), (726: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(628: 9), (631: 6), (639: 6), (642: 8), (643: 4), (683: 3), (718: 1), (726: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
