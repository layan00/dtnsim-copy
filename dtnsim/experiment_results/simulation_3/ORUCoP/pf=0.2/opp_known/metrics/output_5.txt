The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
243(7 to 5), 246(12 to 5), 252(8 to 4), 255(8 to 3), 256(10 to 7), 300(3 to 7), 328(11 to 1), 332(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 40.000000), (246: 50.000000), (252: 120.000000), (255: 90.000000), (256: 10.000000), (328: 80.000000), (332: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 9), (246: 6), (252: 4), (255: 3), (256: 6), (300: 2), (328: 3), (332: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
