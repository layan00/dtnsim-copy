The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
253(7 to 5), 265(12 to 5), 274(8 to 4), 278(8 to 3), 279(10 to 7), 316(3 to 7), 344(11 to 1), 351(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 20.000000), (265: 50.000000), (274: 120.000000), (278: 90.000000), (279: 10.000000), (316: 55.000000), (344: 20.000000), (351: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 13), (265: 6), (274: 5), (278: 6), (279: 7), (316: 3), (344: 5), (351: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 463 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
