The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
977(7 to 5), 980(12 to 5), 987(8 to 4), 990(8 to 3), 991(10 to 7), 1031(3 to 7), 1064(11 to 1), 1072(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(977: 60.000000), (980: 50.000000), (990: 70.000000), (991: 10.000000), (1031: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(977: 9), (980: 6), (987: 7), (990: 6), (991: 4), (1031: 3), (1064: 1), (1072: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
