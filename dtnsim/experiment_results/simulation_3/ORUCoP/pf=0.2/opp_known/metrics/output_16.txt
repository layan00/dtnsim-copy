The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
611(7 to 5), 614(12 to 5), 621(8 to 4), 623(8 to 3), 624(10 to 7), 660(3 to 7), 688(11 to 1), 695(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(614: 50.000000), (623: 70.000000), (624: 10.000000), (660: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(611: 4), (614: 6), (621: 7), (623: 6), (624: 3), (660: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
