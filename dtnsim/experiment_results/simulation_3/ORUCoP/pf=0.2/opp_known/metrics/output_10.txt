The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(7 to 5), 239(12 to 5), 246(8 to 4), 248(8 to 3), 249(10 to 7), 291(3 to 7), 322(11 to 1), 325(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(237: 60.000000), (239: 50.000000), (246: 120.000000), (248: 90.000000), (249: 10.000000), (322: 80.000000), (325: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 10), (239: 6), (246: 5), (248: 6), (249: 4), (322: 3), (325: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
