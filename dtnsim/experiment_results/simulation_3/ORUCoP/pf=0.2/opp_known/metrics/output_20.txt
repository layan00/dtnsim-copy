The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
253(7 to 5), 256(12 to 5), 263(8 to 4), 265(8 to 3), 266(10 to 7), 305(3 to 7), 339(11 to 1), 347(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 60.000000), (256: 50.000000), (263: 120.000000), (265: 90.000000), (266: 10.000000), (305: 55.000000), (339: 80.000000), (347: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 6), (256: 6), (263: 7), (265: 6), (266: 4), (305: 3), (339: 3), (347: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
