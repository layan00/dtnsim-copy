The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(7 to 5), 250(12 to 5), 259(8 to 4), 262(8 to 3), 263(10 to 7), 305(3 to 7), 337(11 to 1), 344(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 40.000000), (250: 50.000000), (262: 70.000000), (263: 10.000000), (344: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 9), (250: 6), (259: 6), (262: 8), (263: 4), (305: 1), (337: 1), (344: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
