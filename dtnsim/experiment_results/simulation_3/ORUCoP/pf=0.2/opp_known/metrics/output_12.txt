The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
964(7 to 5), 966(12 to 5), 973(8 to 4), 975(8 to 3), 976(10 to 7), 1010(3 to 7), 1041(11 to 1), 1045(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(966: 50.000000), (975: 130.000000), (976: 10.000000), (1041: 80.000000), (1045: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(964: 6), (966: 6), (973: 3), (975: 10), (976: 4), (1010: 2), (1041: 3), (1045: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
