The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
604(7 to 5), 607(12 to 5), 613(8 to 4), 616(8 to 3), 617(10 to 7), 648(3 to 7), 675(11 to 1), 678(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(604: 40.000000), (607: 50.000000), (617: 10.000000), (675: 80.000000), (678: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(604: 7), (607: 6), (617: 4), (675: 3), (678: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
