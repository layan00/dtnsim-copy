The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
652(7 to 5), 655(12 to 5), 662(8 to 4), 665(8 to 3), 666(10 to 7), 703(3 to 7), 732(11 to 1), 736(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(652: 40.000000), (655: 50.000000), (665: 130.000000), (666: 10.000000), (703: 55.000000), (732: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(652: 9), (655: 6), (662: 3), (665: 10), (666: 4), (703: 3), (732: 3), (736: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
