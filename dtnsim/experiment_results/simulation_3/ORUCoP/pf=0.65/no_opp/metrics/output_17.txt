The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
219(7 to 5), 221(12 to 5), 226(8 to 4), 228(8 to 3), 229(10 to 7), 235(3 to 7), 242(11 to 1), 244(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 1), (229: 2), (244: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 244: (to: 1, time: 85.000000),
