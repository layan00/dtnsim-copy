The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
334(7 to 5), 336(12 to 5), 339(8 to 4), 341(8 to 3), 342(10 to 7), 353(3 to 7), 362(11 to 1), 367(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(336: 1), (342: 5), (353: 2), (362: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 342: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), (to: 4, time: 40.000000),
