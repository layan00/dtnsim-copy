The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(7 to 5), 227(12 to 5), 233(8 to 4), 235(8 to 3), 236(10 to 7), 243(3 to 7), 253(11 to 1), 257(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(233: 1), (235: 1), (236: 2), (243: 2), (253: 2), (257: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 257: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 243: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Bundle 253: (to: 4, time: 140.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 243: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 257: (to: 1, time: 85.000000),
