The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
402(7 to 5), 404(12 to 5), 409(8 to 4), 411(8 to 3), 412(10 to 7), 426(3 to 7), 434(11 to 1), 436(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(411: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(409: 4), (411: 4), (412: 4), (426: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 409: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), (to: 3, time: 120.000000),
