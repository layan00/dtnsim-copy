The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
58(7 to 5), 60(12 to 5), 65(8 to 4), 67(8 to 3), 68(10 to 7), 82(3 to 7), 91(11 to 1), 96(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(67: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(60: 3), (65: 4), (67: 4), (82: 3), (91: 2), (96: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 79 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
