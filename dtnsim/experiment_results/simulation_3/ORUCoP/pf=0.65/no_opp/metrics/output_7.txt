The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
244(7 to 5), 246(12 to 5), 251(8 to 4), 253(8 to 3), 254(10 to 7), 259(3 to 7), 267(11 to 1), 270(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(251: 120.000000), (253: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(251: 3), (253: 2), (259: 1), (267: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
