The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
432(7 to 5), 434(12 to 5), 440(8 to 4), 442(8 to 3), 443(10 to 7), 456(3 to 7), 461(11 to 1), 464(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(440: 120.000000), (442: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(440: 6), (442: 4), (443: 2), (461: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
