The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
427(7 to 5), 429(12 to 5), 434(8 to 4), 436(8 to 3), 437(10 to 7), 449(3 to 7), 454(11 to 1), 457(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(434: 2), (436: 2), (454: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
