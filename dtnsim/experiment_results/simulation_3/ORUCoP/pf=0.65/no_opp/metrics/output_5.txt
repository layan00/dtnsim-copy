The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
50(7 to 5), 52(12 to 5), 57(8 to 4), 59(8 to 3), 60(10 to 7), 69(3 to 7), 78(11 to 1), 83(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(78: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(52: 1), (60: 4), (69: 2), (78: 3), (83: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
