The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(7 to 5), 175(12 to 5), 180(8 to 4), 183(8 to 3), 184(10 to 7), 196(3 to 7), 205(11 to 1), 210(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(184: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(175: 3), (180: 1), (183: 1), (184: 7), (196: 1), (210: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 184: (to: 9, time: 80.000000),
