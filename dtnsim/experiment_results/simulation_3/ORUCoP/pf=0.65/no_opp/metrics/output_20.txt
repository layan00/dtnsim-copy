The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(7 to 5), 72(12 to 5), 75(8 to 4), 77(8 to 3), 78(10 to 7), 91(3 to 7), 102(11 to 1), 108(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(108: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 7), (91: 2), (108: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 78: (to: 9, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 108: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 108: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Node 3:
