The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
140(7 to 5), 142(12 to 5), 145(8 to 4), 147(8 to 3), 148(10 to 7), 155(3 to 7), 161(11 to 1), 163(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(145: 1), (147: 1), (148: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 148: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 145: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Bundle 147: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 148: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 40.000000),
