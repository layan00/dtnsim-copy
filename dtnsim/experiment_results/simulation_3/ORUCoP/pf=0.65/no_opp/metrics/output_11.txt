The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
158(7 to 5), 160(12 to 5), 164(8 to 4), 166(8 to 3), 167(10 to 7), 172(3 to 7), 183(11 to 1), 186(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(183: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(160: 2), (167: 2), (183: 3), (186: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 183: (to: 4, time: 140.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 183: (to: 1, time: 160.000000), 
Bundle 186: (to: 1, time: 85.000000),
