The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
420(7 to 5), 422(12 to 5), 429(8 to 4), 431(8 to 3), 432(10 to 7), 444(3 to 7), 449(11 to 1), 451(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(429: 120.000000), (431: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(429: 6), (431: 4), (432: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2:
