The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
466(7 to 5), 468(12 to 5), 473(8 to 4), 475(8 to 3), 476(10 to 7), 487(3 to 7), 496(11 to 1), 499(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(473: 2), (475: 2), (487: 1), (496: 1), (499: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 499: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 487: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 499: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 473: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 475: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Bundle 496: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 12:
