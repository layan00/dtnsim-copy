The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
392(7 to 5), 394(12 to 5), 399(8 to 4), 402(8 to 3), 403(10 to 7), 414(3 to 7), 423(11 to 1), 427(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(394: 2), (403: 5), (414: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 394: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 403: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 414: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 403: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 414: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5:
