The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
368(7 to 5), 370(12 to 5), 373(8 to 4), 375(8 to 3), 376(10 to 7), 382(3 to 7), 395(11 to 1), 398(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(398: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(395: 2), (398: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 398: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 398: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 395: (to: 4, time: 140.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 398: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Bundle 395: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Node 14: 
Node 15:
