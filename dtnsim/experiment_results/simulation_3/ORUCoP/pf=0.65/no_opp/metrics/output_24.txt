The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
495(7 to 5), 497(12 to 5), 502(8 to 4), 504(8 to 3), 505(10 to 7), 519(3 to 7), 527(11 to 1), 530(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(519: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(497: 2), (502: 2), (504: 2), (505: 1), (519: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 519: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 519: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6:
