The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
53(7 to 5), 55(12 to 5), 58(8 to 4), 60(8 to 3), 61(10 to 7), 73(3 to 7), 81(11 to 1), 84(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(58: 2), (60: 2), (61: 2), (81: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 81: (to: 4, time: 140.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 81: (to: 1, time: 160.000000), 
Node 5:
