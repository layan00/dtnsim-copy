The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
254(7 to 5), 256(12 to 5), 258(8 to 4), 260(8 to 3), 261(10 to 7), 265(3 to 7), 274(11 to 1), 276(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(260: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(258: 2), (260: 2), (261: 2), (276: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 258: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Bundle 260: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 276: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 258: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
