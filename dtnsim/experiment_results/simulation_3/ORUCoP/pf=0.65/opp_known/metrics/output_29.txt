The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1333(7 to 5), 1335(12 to 5), 1343(8 to 4), 1346(8 to 3), 1347(10 to 7), 1377(3 to 7), 1396(11 to 1), 1399(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1333: 60.000000), (1335: 10.000000), (1343: 120.000000), (1346: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1333: 5), (1335: 4), (1343: 4), (1346: 3), (1347: 2), (1377: 1), (1396: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
