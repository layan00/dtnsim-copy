The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
462(7 to 5), 464(12 to 5), 470(8 to 4), 472(8 to 3), 473(10 to 7), 509(3 to 7), 530(11 to 1), 533(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(473: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(462: 4), (464: 4), (470: 2), (472: 2), (473: 8), (530: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
