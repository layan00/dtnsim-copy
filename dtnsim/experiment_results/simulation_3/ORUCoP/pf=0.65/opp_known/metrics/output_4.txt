The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1314(7 to 5), 1316(12 to 5), 1325(8 to 4), 1328(8 to 3), 1329(10 to 7), 1356(3 to 7), 1375(11 to 1), 1381(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1316: 10.000000), (1325: 120.000000), (1328: 90.000000), (1329: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1314: 2), (1316: 4), (1325: 7), (1328: 6), (1329: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
