The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1307(7 to 5), 1309(12 to 5), 1316(8 to 4), 1318(8 to 3), 1319(10 to 7), 1355(3 to 7), 1372(11 to 1), 1375(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1307: 6), (1309: 4), (1316: 2), (1318: 8), (1319: 4), (1372: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
