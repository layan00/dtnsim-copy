The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
169(7 to 5), 171(12 to 5), 177(8 to 4), 180(8 to 3), 181(10 to 7), 213(3 to 7), 230(11 to 1), 232(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(171: 10.000000), (181: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(169: 3), (171: 4), (177: 2), (180: 2), (181: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
