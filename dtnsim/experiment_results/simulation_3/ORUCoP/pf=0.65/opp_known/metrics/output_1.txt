The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
496(7 to 5), 498(12 to 5), 504(8 to 4), 506(8 to 3), 507(10 to 7), 535(3 to 7), 555(11 to 1), 557(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(506: 130.000000), (507: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(496: 2), (498: 4), (504: 1), (506: 10), (507: 5), (557: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
