The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1360(7 to 5), 1362(12 to 5), 1369(8 to 4), 1371(8 to 3), 1372(10 to 7), 1404(3 to 7), 1426(11 to 1), 1433(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1371: 130.000000), (1372: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1360: 4), (1362: 4), (1369: 5), (1371: 6), (1372: 3), (1426: 1), (1433: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
