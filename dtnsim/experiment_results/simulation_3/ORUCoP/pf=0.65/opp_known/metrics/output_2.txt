The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
766(7 to 5), 768(12 to 5), 772(8 to 4), 774(8 to 3), 775(10 to 7), 801(3 to 7), 822(11 to 1), 824(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(768: 50.000000), (774: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(766: 4), (768: 6), (772: 2), (774: 3), (775: 4), (824: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
