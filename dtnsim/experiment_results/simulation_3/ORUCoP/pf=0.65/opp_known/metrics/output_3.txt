The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1036(7 to 5), 1038(12 to 5), 1044(8 to 4), 1046(8 to 3), 1047(10 to 7), 1072(3 to 7), 1090(11 to 1), 1093(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1036: 2), (1038: 4), (1047: 4), (1090: 1), (1093: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
