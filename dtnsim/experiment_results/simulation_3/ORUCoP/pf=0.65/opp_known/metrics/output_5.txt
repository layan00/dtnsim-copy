The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
182(7 to 5), 184(12 to 5), 190(8 to 4), 193(8 to 3), 194(10 to 7), 217(3 to 7), 237(11 to 1), 240(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(184: 10.000000), (237: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(182: 2), (184: 4), (194: 2), (237: 3), (240: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
