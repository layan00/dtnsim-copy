The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1303(7 to 5), 1305(12 to 5), 1312(8 to 4), 1315(8 to 3), 1316(10 to 7), 1344(3 to 7), 1365(11 to 1), 1371(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1305: 10.000000), (1315: 90.000000), (1316: 50.000000), (1344: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1303: 2), (1305: 4), (1312: 4), (1315: 6), (1316: 5), (1344: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
