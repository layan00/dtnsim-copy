The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1015(7 to 5), 1017(12 to 5), 1026(8 to 4), 1029(8 to 3), 1030(10 to 7), 1065(3 to 7), 1083(11 to 1), 1085(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1017: 10.000000), (1029: 130.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1015: 8), (1017: 4), (1026: 2), (1029: 10), (1030: 2), (1065: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
