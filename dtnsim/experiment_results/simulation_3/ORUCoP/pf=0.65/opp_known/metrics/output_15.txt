The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
184(7 to 5), 186(12 to 5), 195(8 to 4), 197(8 to 3), 198(10 to 7), 221(3 to 7), 242(11 to 1), 245(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(186: 50.000000), (198: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(184: 2), (186: 6), (198: 3), (242: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
