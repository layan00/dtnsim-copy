The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
751(7 to 5), 753(12 to 5), 760(8 to 4), 762(8 to 3), 763(10 to 7), 787(3 to 7), 807(11 to 1), 810(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(760: 120.000000), (762: 90.000000), (763: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(751: 2), (753: 4), (760: 3), (762: 3), (763: 4), (807: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
