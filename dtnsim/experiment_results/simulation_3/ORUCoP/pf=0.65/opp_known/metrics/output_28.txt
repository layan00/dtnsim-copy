The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1037(7 to 5), 1039(12 to 5), 1046(8 to 4), 1048(8 to 3), 1049(10 to 7), 1074(3 to 7), 1097(11 to 1), 1103(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1049: 50.000000), (1074: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1037: 2), (1039: 4), (1049: 5), (1074: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
