The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
498(7 to 5), 500(12 to 5), 507(8 to 4), 509(8 to 3), 510(10 to 7), 542(3 to 7), 568(11 to 1), 570(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(498: 60.000000), (500: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(498: 10), (500: 6), (510: 2), (542: 1), (570: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
