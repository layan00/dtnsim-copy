The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
746(7 to 5), 748(12 to 5), 756(8 to 4), 759(8 to 3), 760(10 to 7), 785(3 to 7), 805(11 to 1), 808(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(748: 10.000000), (760: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(746: 3), (748: 4), (756: 1), (759: 2), (760: 3), (805: 2), (808: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
