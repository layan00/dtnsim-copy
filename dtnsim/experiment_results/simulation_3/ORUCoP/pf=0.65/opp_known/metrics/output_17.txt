The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
734(7 to 5), 736(12 to 5), 742(8 to 4), 744(8 to 3), 745(10 to 7), 768(3 to 7), 788(11 to 1), 790(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(745: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(734: 2), (736: 4), (745: 4), (790: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 790: (to: 1, time: 85.000000),
