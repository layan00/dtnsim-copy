The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1031(7 to 5), 1033(12 to 5), 1037(8 to 4), 1039(8 to 3), 1040(10 to 7), 1066(3 to 7), 1088(11 to 1), 1091(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1033: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1031: 3), (1033: 6), (1040: 2), (1088: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
