The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1109(7 to 5), 1111(12 to 5), 1117(8 to 4), 1119(8 to 3), 1120(10 to 7), 1147(3 to 7), 1168(11 to 1), 1172(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1120: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1109: 4), (1111: 4), (1120: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
