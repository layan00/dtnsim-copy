The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
486(7 to 5), 488(12 to 5), 493(8 to 4), 495(8 to 3), 496(10 to 7), 519(3 to 7), 543(11 to 1), 546(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(488: 50.000000), (496: 10.000000), (543: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(486: 2), (488: 6), (496: 4), (543: 3), (546: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
