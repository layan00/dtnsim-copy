The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
190(7 to 5), 192(12 to 5), 198(8 to 4), 200(8 to 3), 201(10 to 7), 234(3 to 7), 260(11 to 1), 265(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(200: 90.000000), (201: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(190: 4), (192: 4), (198: 3), (200: 3), (201: 4), (234: 6), (260: 3), (265: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 561 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
