The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
449(7 to 5), 451(12 to 5), 459(8 to 4), 461(8 to 3), 462(10 to 7), 496(3 to 7), 516(11 to 1), 518(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(451: 50.000000), (462: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(449: 6), (451: 6), (459: 1), (461: 8), (462: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
