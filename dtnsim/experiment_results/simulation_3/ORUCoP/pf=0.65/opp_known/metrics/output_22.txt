The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
801(7 to 5), 803(12 to 5), 808(8 to 4), 810(8 to 3), 811(10 to 7), 845(3 to 7), 865(11 to 1), 867(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(810: 130.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(801: 8), (803: 4), (808: 1), (810: 10), (811: 4), (845: 1), (867: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
