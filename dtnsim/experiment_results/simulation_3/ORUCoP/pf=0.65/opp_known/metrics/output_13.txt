The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1068(7 to 5), 1070(12 to 5), 1075(8 to 4), 1077(8 to 3), 1078(10 to 7), 1104(3 to 7), 1131(11 to 1), 1136(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1104: 35.000000), (1136: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1068: 2), (1070: 4), (1078: 4), (1104: 4), (1131: 2), (1136: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
