The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1396(7 to 5), 1398(12 to 5), 1404(8 to 4), 1407(8 to 3), 1408(10 to 7), 1442(3 to 7), 1463(11 to 1), 1469(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1398: 10.000000), (1408: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1396: 4), (1398: 4), (1404: 5), (1407: 5), (1408: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
