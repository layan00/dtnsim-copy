The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
776(7 to 5), 778(12 to 5), 784(8 to 4), 787(8 to 3), 788(10 to 7), 815(3 to 7), 837(11 to 1), 840(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(778: 10.000000), (788: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(776: 2), (778: 4), (788: 6), (837: 1), (840: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
