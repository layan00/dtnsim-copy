The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(7 to 5), 204(12 to 5), 209(8 to 4), 211(8 to 3), 212(10 to 7), 240(3 to 7), 265(11 to 1), 269(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(204: 50.000000), (212: 50.000000), (269: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 3), (204: 6), (212: 5), (269: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
