The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(7 to 5), 187(12 to 5), 192(8 to 4), 194(8 to 3), 195(10 to 7), 228(3 to 7), 251(11 to 1), 256(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(187: 50.000000), (195: 10.000000), (228: 35.000000), (251: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 4), (187: 6), (192: 2), (194: 2), (195: 4), (228: 4), (251: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
