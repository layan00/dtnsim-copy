The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
186(7 to 5), 188(12 to 5), 206(8 to 4), 210(8 to 3), 211(10 to 7), 245(3 to 7), 291(11 to 1), 297(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(188: 10.000000), (291: 80.000000), (297: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 2), (188: 6), (211: 2), (245: 5), (291: 4), (297: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 145 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
