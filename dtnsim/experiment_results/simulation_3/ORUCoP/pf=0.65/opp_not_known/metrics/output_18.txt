The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1353(7 to 5), 1355(12 to 5), 1376(8 to 4), 1380(8 to 3), 1381(10 to 7), 1425(3 to 7), 1469(11 to 1), 1475(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1355: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1353: 4), (1355: 6), (1376: 2), (1380: 2), (1381: 4), (1425: 4), (1469: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 128 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
