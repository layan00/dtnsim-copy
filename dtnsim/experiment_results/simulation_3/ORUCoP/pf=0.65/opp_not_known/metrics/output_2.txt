The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
987(7 to 5), 989(12 to 5), 1005(8 to 4), 1007(8 to 3), 1008(10 to 7), 1038(3 to 7), 1085(11 to 1), 1091(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(989: 50.000000), (1007: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(987: 2), (989: 6), (1005: 2), (1007: 2), (1008: 2), (1085: 4), (1091: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 168 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
