The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1757(7 to 5), 1763(12 to 5), 1784(8 to 4), 1789(8 to 3), 1790(10 to 7), 1827(3 to 7), 1869(11 to 1), 1875(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1763: 10.000000), (1784: 120.000000), (1789: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1757: 6), (1763: 6), (1784: 6), (1789: 4), (1790: 4), (1869: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
