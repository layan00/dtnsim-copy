The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1749(7 to 5), 1751(12 to 5), 1770(8 to 4), 1774(8 to 3), 1775(10 to 7), 1814(3 to 7), 1860(11 to 1), 1866(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1751: 10.000000), (1774: 90.000000), (1860: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1749: 2), (1751: 6), (1770: 4), (1774: 4), (1775: 4), (1814: 2), (1860: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
