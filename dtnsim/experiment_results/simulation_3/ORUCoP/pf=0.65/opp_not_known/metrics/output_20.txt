The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(7 to 5), 210(12 to 5), 227(8 to 4), 229(8 to 3), 230(10 to 7), 267(3 to 7), 316(11 to 1), 326(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 50.000000), (326: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 2), (210: 6), (230: 8), (267: 2), (316: 4), (326: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 133 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
