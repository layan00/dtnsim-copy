The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
984(7 to 5), 988(12 to 5), 1007(8 to 4), 1009(8 to 3), 1010(10 to 7), 1039(3 to 7), 1084(11 to 1), 1088(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1007: 120.000000), (1009: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(984: 2), (988: 4), (1007: 3), (1009: 2), (1039: 2), (1084: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 138 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
