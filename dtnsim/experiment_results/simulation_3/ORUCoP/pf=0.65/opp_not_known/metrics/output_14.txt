The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1802(7 to 5), 1804(12 to 5), 1823(8 to 4), 1825(8 to 3), 1826(10 to 7), 1863(3 to 7), 1909(11 to 1), 1916(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1802: 2), (1804: 4), (1823: 2), (1825: 2), (1863: 5), (1909: 3), (1916: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 197 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
