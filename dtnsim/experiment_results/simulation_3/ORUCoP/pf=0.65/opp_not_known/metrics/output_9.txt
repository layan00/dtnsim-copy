The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1771(7 to 5), 1773(12 to 5), 1792(8 to 4), 1794(8 to 3), 1795(10 to 7), 1834(3 to 7), 1875(11 to 1), 1879(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1771: 3), (1773: 4), (1792: 2), (1794: 2), (1795: 2), (1875: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 170 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
