The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
590(7 to 5), 596(12 to 5), 614(8 to 4), 618(8 to 3), 619(10 to 7), 653(3 to 7), 698(11 to 1), 702(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(590: 6), (596: 4), (614: 2), (618: 2), (698: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 137 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
