The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1031(7 to 5), 1033(12 to 5), 1050(8 to 4), 1052(8 to 3), 1053(10 to 7), 1089(3 to 7), 1135(11 to 1), 1141(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1031: 4), (1033: 4), (1050: 1), (1052: 1), (1089: 4), (1135: 4), (1141: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 181 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
