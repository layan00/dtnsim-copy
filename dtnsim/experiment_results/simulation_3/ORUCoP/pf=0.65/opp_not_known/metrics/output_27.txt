The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
965(7 to 5), 967(12 to 5), 987(8 to 4), 991(8 to 3), 992(10 to 7), 1027(3 to 7), 1072(11 to 1), 1077(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(967: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(965: 3), (967: 6), (987: 1), (991: 1), (992: 2), (1027: 3), (1072: 4), (1077: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 118 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
