The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(7 to 5), 191(12 to 5), 208(8 to 4), 210(8 to 3), 211(10 to 7), 249(3 to 7), 295(11 to 1), 299(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(191: 50.000000), (295: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 2), (191: 6), (208: 2), (210: 2), (211: 2), (295: 5), (299: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 148 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
