The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
609(7 to 5), 613(12 to 5), 631(8 to 4), 633(8 to 3), 634(10 to 7), 669(3 to 7), 714(11 to 1), 723(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(634: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(609: 2), (613: 4), (631: 1), (633: 1), (634: 7), (669: 1), (714: 4), (723: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
