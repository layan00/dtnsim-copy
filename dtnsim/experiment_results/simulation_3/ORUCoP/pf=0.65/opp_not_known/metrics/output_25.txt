The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(7 to 5), 179(12 to 5), 197(8 to 4), 203(8 to 3), 204(10 to 7), 241(3 to 7), 281(11 to 1), 287(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(179: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 6), (179: 6), (197: 2), (203: 2), (204: 2), (281: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 88 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
