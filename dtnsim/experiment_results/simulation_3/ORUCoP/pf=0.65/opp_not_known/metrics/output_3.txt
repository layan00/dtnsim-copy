The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1369(7 to 5), 1373(12 to 5), 1391(8 to 4), 1393(8 to 3), 1394(10 to 7), 1423(3 to 7), 1467(11 to 1), 1472(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1369: 2), (1373: 6), (1394: 2), (1423: 3), (1467: 2), (1472: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
