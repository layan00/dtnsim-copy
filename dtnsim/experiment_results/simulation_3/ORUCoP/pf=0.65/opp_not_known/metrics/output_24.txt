The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1848(7 to 5), 1850(12 to 5), 1868(8 to 4), 1872(8 to 3), 1873(10 to 7), 1913(3 to 7), 1958(11 to 1), 1965(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1850: 10.000000), (1913: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1848: 2), (1850: 6), (1868: 2), (1872: 2), (1873: 2), (1913: 6), (1958: 4), (1965: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 134 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
