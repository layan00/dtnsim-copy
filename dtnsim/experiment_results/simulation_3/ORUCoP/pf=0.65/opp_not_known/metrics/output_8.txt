The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1372(7 to 5), 1374(12 to 5), 1390(8 to 4), 1392(8 to 3), 1393(10 to 7), 1431(3 to 7), 1478(11 to 1), 1484(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1374: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1372: 3), (1374: 6), (1393: 8), (1431: 3), (1478: 3), (1484: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 146 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
