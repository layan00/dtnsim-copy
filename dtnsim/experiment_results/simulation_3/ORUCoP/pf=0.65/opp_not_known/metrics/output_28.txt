The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1375(7 to 5), 1377(12 to 5), 1396(8 to 4), 1398(8 to 3), 1399(10 to 7), 1434(3 to 7), 1478(11 to 1), 1484(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1375: 2), (1377: 4), (1399: 2), (1478: 4), (1484: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 171 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
