The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1438(7 to 5), 1442(12 to 5), 1460(8 to 4), 1463(8 to 3), 1464(10 to 7), 1501(3 to 7), 1546(11 to 1), 1554(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1546: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1438: 5), (1442: 4), (1464: 8), (1501: 3), (1546: 6), (1554: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 145 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
