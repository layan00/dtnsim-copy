The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
995(7 to 5), 997(12 to 5), 1015(8 to 4), 1019(8 to 3), 1020(10 to 7), 1055(3 to 7), 1101(11 to 1), 1106(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(997: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(995: 2), (997: 6), (1020: 2), (1055: 3), (1101: 3), (1106: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
