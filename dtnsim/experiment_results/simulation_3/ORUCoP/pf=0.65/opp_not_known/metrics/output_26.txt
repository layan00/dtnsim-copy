The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
568(7 to 5), 572(12 to 5), 592(8 to 4), 595(8 to 3), 596(10 to 7), 628(3 to 7), 674(11 to 1), 680(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(572: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(568: 5), (572: 6), (592: 1), (595: 1), (596: 2), (674: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 138 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
