The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
596(7 to 5), 600(12 to 5), 617(8 to 4), 619(8 to 3), 620(10 to 7), 648(3 to 7), 697(11 to 1), 701(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(600: 50.000000), (697: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(596: 2), (600: 6), (620: 2), (697: 5), (701: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
