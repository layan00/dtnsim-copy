The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(7 to 5), 196(12 to 5), 214(8 to 4), 216(8 to 3), 217(10 to 7), 257(3 to 7), 305(11 to 1), 312(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(216: 90.000000), (217: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 4), (196: 4), (214: 4), (216: 4), (217: 4), (257: 5), (305: 3), (312: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
