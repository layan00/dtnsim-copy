The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
578(7 to 5), 582(12 to 5), 599(8 to 4), 603(8 to 3), 604(10 to 7), 635(3 to 7), 678(11 to 1), 684(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(582: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(578: 2), (582: 6), (599: 1), (603: 1), (604: 4), (678: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
