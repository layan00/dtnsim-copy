The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
188(7 to 5), 194(12 to 5), 215(8 to 4), 218(8 to 3), 219(10 to 7), 247(3 to 7), 296(11 to 1), 300(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(194: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(188: 5), (194: 6), (219: 4), (296: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
