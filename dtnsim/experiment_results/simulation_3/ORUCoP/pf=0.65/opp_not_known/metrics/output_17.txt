The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
960(7 to 5), 962(12 to 5), 980(8 to 4), 982(8 to 3), 983(10 to 7), 1015(3 to 7), 1058(11 to 1), 1064(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(960: 2), (962: 4), (983: 2), (1058: 4), (1064: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 153 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
