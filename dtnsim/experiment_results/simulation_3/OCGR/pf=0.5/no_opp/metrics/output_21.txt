The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
264(7 to 5), 266(12 to 5), 270(8 to 4), 271(8 to 3), 272(10 to 7), 279(3 to 7), 289(11 to 1), 291(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(264: 2), (266: 2), (270: 2), (271: 2), (272: 2), (279: 1), (289: 2), (291: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
