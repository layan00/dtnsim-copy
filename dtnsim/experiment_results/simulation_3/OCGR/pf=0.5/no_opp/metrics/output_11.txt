The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(7 to 5), 248(12 to 5), 251(8 to 4), 252(8 to 3), 253(10 to 7), 255(3 to 7), 267(11 to 1), 269(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(267: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 2), (248: 2), (251: 2), (252: 2), (253: 3), (255: 1), (267: 3), (269: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 246: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
