The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
546(7 to 5), 549(12 to 5), 552(8 to 4), 553(8 to 3), 554(10 to 7), 559(3 to 7), 567(11 to 1), 571(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(567: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(546: 3), (549: 2), (552: 3), (553: 3), (554: 2), (559: 4), (567: 3), (571: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
