The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(7 to 5), 247(12 to 5), 254(8 to 4), 256(8 to 3), 257(10 to 7), 266(3 to 7), 274(11 to 1), 275(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(254: 120.000000), (256: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 2), (247: 3), (254: 4), (256: 3), (257: 3), (266: 2), (274: 1), (275: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
