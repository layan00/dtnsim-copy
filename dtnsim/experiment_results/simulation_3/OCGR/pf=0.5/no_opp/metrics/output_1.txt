The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
272(7 to 5), 274(12 to 5), 279(8 to 4), 281(8 to 3), 282(10 to 7), 290(3 to 7), 299(11 to 1), 306(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(282: 50.000000), (290: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(272: 2), (274: 3), (279: 3), (281: 3), (282: 5), (290: 4), (299: 1), (306: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
