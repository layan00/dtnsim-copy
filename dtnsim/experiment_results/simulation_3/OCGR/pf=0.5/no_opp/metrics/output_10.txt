The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
103(7 to 5), 104(12 to 5), 106(8 to 4), 107(8 to 3), 108(10 to 7), 118(3 to 7), 130(11 to 1), 132(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(130: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(103: 1), (104: 3), (106: 2), (107: 2), (108: 4), (118: 1), (130: 3), (132: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 106: (to: 3, time: 120.000000),
