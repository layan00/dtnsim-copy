The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
686(7 to 5), 687(12 to 5), 692(8 to 4), 693(8 to 3), 694(10 to 7), 703(3 to 7), 707(11 to 1), 709(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(692: 120.000000), (693: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(686: 1), (687: 2), (692: 3), (693: 2), (694: 2), (703: 1), (707: 3), (709: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
