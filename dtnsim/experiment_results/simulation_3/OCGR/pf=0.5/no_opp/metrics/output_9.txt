The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
668(7 to 5), 669(12 to 5), 673(8 to 4), 674(8 to 3), 675(10 to 7), 688(3 to 7), 696(11 to 1), 698(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(668: 1), (669: 4), (673: 2), (674: 2), (675: 2), (688: 2), (696: 2), (698: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
