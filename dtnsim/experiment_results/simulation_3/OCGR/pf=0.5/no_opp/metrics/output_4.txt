The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
690(7 to 5), 693(12 to 5), 699(8 to 4), 701(8 to 3), 702(10 to 7), 712(3 to 7), 720(11 to 1), 721(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(699: 120.000000), (701: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(690: 4), (693: 3), (699: 3), (701: 2), (702: 3), (712: 2), (720: 1), (721: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
