The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
540(7 to 5), 541(12 to 5), 546(8 to 4), 547(8 to 3), 548(10 to 7), 559(3 to 7), 569(11 to 1), 571(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(540: 1), (541: 2), (546: 2), (547: 2), (548: 3), (559: 2), (569: 2), (571: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
