The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
404(7 to 5), 405(12 to 5), 409(8 to 4), 411(8 to 3), 412(10 to 7), 419(3 to 7), 425(11 to 1), 426(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(409: 120.000000), (411: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(404: 1), (405: 4), (409: 4), (411: 3), (412: 2), (419: 1), (425: 1), (426: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 426: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 405: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
