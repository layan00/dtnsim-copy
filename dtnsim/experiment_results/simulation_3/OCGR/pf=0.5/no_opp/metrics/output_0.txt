The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
114(7 to 5), 117(12 to 5), 123(8 to 4), 126(8 to 3), 127(10 to 7), 137(3 to 7), 147(11 to 1), 150(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(123: 120.000000), (126: 90.000000), (147: 80.000000), (150: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(114: 5), (117: 4), (123: 3), (126: 2), (127: 2), (137: 3), (147: 3), (150: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
