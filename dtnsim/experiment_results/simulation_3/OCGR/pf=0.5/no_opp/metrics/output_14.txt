The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
683(7 to 5), 684(12 to 5), 689(8 to 4), 690(8 to 3), 691(10 to 7), 701(3 to 7), 710(11 to 1), 716(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(683: 1), (684: 2), (689: 2), (690: 2), (691: 5), (701: 4), (710: 2), (716: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
