The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
529(7 to 5), 530(12 to 5), 533(8 to 4), 534(8 to 3), 535(10 to 7), 544(3 to 7), 553(11 to 1), 555(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(553: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(529: 1), (530: 2), (533: 2), (534: 2), (535: 3), (544: 2), (553: 3), (555: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
