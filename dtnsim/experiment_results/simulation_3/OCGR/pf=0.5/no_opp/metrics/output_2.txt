The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
413(7 to 5), 414(12 to 5), 417(8 to 4), 418(8 to 3), 419(10 to 7), 422(3 to 7), 432(11 to 1), 433(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(418: 90.000000), (433: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(413: 1), (414: 2), (417: 4), (418: 3), (419: 3), (422: 1), (432: 1), (433: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 433: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 417: (to: 3, time: 120.000000),
