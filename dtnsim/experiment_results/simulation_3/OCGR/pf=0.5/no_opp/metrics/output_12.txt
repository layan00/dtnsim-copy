The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
386(7 to 5), 387(12 to 5), 390(8 to 4), 391(8 to 3), 392(10 to 7), 401(3 to 7), 412(11 to 1), 416(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(412: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(386: 1), (387: 3), (390: 2), (391: 2), (392: 4), (401: 3), (412: 3), (416: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
