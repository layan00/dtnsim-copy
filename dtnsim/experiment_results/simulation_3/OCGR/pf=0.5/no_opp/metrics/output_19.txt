The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
660(7 to 5), 662(12 to 5), 667(8 to 4), 668(8 to 3), 669(10 to 7), 680(3 to 7), 691(11 to 1), 692(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(668: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(660: 2), (662: 2), (667: 3), (668: 2), (669: 3), (680: 2), (691: 1), (692: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 660: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
