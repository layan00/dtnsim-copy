The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
534(7 to 5), 535(12 to 5), 539(8 to 4), 540(8 to 3), 541(10 to 7), 547(3 to 7), 563(11 to 1), 566(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(566: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(534: 1), (535: 3), (539: 2), (540: 2), (541: 5), (547: 1), (563: 3), (566: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
