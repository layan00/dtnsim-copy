The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
248(7 to 5), 251(12 to 5), 257(8 to 4), 259(8 to 3), 260(10 to 7), 268(3 to 7), 281(11 to 1), 283(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(248: 4), (251: 3), (257: 2), (259: 2), (260: 4), (268: 1), (281: 2), (283: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
