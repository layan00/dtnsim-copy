The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
551(7 to 5), 554(12 to 5), 558(8 to 4), 561(8 to 3), 562(10 to 7), 570(3 to 7), 579(11 to 1), 581(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(551: 4), (554: 3), (558: 2), (561: 2), (562: 3), (570: 2), (579: 2), (581: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
