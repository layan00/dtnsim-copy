The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
699(7 to 5), 700(12 to 5), 705(8 to 4), 706(8 to 3), 707(10 to 7), 718(3 to 7), 729(11 to 1), 731(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(699: 1), (700: 2), (705: 2), (706: 2), (707: 2), (718: 2), (729: 2), (731: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
