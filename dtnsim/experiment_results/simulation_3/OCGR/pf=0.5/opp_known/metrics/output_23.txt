The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1247(7 to 5), 1253(12 to 5), 1258(8 to 4), 1259(8 to 3), 1260(10 to 7), 1280(3 to 7), 1300(11 to 1), 1303(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1300: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1247: 7), (1253: 4), (1258: 2), (1259: 2), (1260: 4), (1280: 1), (1300: 3), (1303: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
