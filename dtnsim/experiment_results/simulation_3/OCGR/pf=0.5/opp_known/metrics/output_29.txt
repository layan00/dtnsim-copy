The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1580(7 to 5), 1581(12 to 5), 1588(8 to 4), 1590(8 to 3), 1591(10 to 7), 1617(3 to 7), 1637(11 to 1), 1640(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1580: 60.000000), (1581: 10.000000), (1588: 120.000000), (1590: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1580: 6), (1581: 3), (1588: 3), (1590: 3), (1591: 4), (1617: 4), (1637: 3), (1640: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
