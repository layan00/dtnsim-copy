The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
231(7 to 5), 234(12 to 5), 242(8 to 4), 244(8 to 3), 245(10 to 7), 262(3 to 7), 284(11 to 1), 287(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 50.000000), (245: 10.000000), (284: 20.000000), (287: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(231: 5), (234: 4), (242: 2), (244: 2), (245: 3), (262: 1), (284: 3), (287: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
