The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
231(7 to 5), 234(12 to 5), 241(8 to 4), 244(8 to 3), 245(10 to 7), 270(3 to 7), 291(11 to 1), 296(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 10.000000), (245: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(231: 5), (234: 3), (241: 2), (244: 5), (245: 6), (270: 1), (291: 3), (296: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
