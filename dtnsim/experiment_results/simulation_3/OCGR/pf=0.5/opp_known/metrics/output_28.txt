The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1243(7 to 5), 1244(12 to 5), 1250(8 to 4), 1251(8 to 3), 1252(10 to 7), 1277(3 to 7), 1302(11 to 1), 1307(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1251: 70.000000), (1302: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1243: 4), (1244: 4), (1250: 2), (1251: 5), (1252: 4), (1277: 4), (1302: 3), (1307: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
