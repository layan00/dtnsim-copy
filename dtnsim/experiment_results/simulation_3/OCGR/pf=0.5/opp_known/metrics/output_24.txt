The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1578(7 to 5), 1579(12 to 5), 1585(8 to 4), 1587(8 to 3), 1588(10 to 7), 1619(3 to 7), 1642(11 to 1), 1647(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1579: 10.000000), (1588: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1578: 5), (1579: 3), (1585: 2), (1587: 5), (1588: 6), (1619: 1), (1642: 3), (1647: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
