The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1573(7 to 5), 1579(12 to 5), 1587(8 to 4), 1590(8 to 3), 1591(10 to 7), 1613(3 to 7), 1633(11 to 1), 1638(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1573: 20.000000), (1579: 10.000000), (1587: 120.000000), (1591: 10.000000), (1633: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1573: 6), (1579: 3), (1587: 3), (1590: 5), (1591: 3), (1613: 1), (1633: 3), (1638: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
