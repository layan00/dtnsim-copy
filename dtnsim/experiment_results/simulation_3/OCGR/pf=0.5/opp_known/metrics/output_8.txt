The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1224(7 to 5), 1225(12 to 5), 1229(8 to 4), 1230(8 to 3), 1231(10 to 7), 1256(3 to 7), 1277(11 to 1), 1280(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1225: 50.000000), (1231: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1224: 5), (1225: 4), (1229: 2), (1230: 2), (1231: 3), (1256: 1), (1277: 3), (1280: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
