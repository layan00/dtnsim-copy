The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
239(7 to 5), 240(12 to 5), 254(8 to 4), 255(8 to 3), 256(10 to 7), 291(3 to 7), 346(11 to 1), 349(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(240: 50.000000), (291: 0.000000), (346: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(239: 4), (240: 4), (254: 3), (255: 3), (256: 4), (291: 6), (346: 3), (349: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
