The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1130(7 to 5), 1131(12 to 5), 1146(8 to 4), 1147(8 to 3), 1148(10 to 7), 1177(3 to 7), 1224(11 to 1), 1227(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1131: 50.000000), (1147: 90.000000), (1224: 20.000000), (1227: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1130: 4), (1131: 4), (1146: 4), (1147: 3), (1148: 3), (1177: 1), (1224: 3), (1227: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
