The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1992(7 to 5), 1994(12 to 5), 2011(8 to 4), 2013(8 to 3), 2014(10 to 7), 2048(3 to 7), 2099(11 to 1), 2102(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1994: 10.000000), (2013: 130.000000), (2099: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1992: 2), (1994: 3), (2011: 2), (2013: 5), (2014: 1), (2048: 4), (2099: 3), (2102: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
