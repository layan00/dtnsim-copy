The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
673(7 to 5), 675(12 to 5), 691(8 to 4), 693(8 to 3), 694(10 to 7), 724(3 to 7), 767(11 to 1), 770(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(675: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(673: 2), (675: 3), (691: 3), (693: 3), (694: 3), (724: 2), (767: 3), (770: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
