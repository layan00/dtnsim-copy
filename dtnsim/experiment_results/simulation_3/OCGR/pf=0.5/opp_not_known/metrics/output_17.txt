The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1101(7 to 5), 1102(12 to 5), 1118(8 to 4), 1120(8 to 3), 1121(10 to 7), 1157(3 to 7), 1203(11 to 1), 1206(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1102: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1101: 6), (1102: 3), (1118: 2), (1120: 2), (1121: 1), (1157: 4), (1203: 3), (1206: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
