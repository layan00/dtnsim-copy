The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
679(7 to 5), 682(12 to 5), 700(8 to 4), 703(8 to 3), 704(10 to 7), 735(3 to 7), 784(11 to 1), 787(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(682: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(679: 4), (682: 3), (700: 2), (703: 2), (704: 4), (735: 1), (784: 3), (787: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
