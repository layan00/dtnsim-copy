The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
698(7 to 5), 700(12 to 5), 716(8 to 4), 718(8 to 3), 719(10 to 7), 752(3 to 7), 796(11 to 1), 799(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(698: 5), (700: 4), (716: 3), (718: 3), (719: 1), (752: 1), (796: 3), (799: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
