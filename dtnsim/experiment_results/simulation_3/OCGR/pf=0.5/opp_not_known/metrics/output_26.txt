The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
678(7 to 5), 680(12 to 5), 698(8 to 4), 700(8 to 3), 701(10 to 7), 735(3 to 7), 779(11 to 1), 782(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(680: 50.000000), (698: 120.000000), (700: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(678: 5), (680: 4), (698: 4), (700: 3), (701: 1), (735: 1), (779: 3), (782: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
