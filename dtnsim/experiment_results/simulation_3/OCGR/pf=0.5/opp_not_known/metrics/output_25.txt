The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
235(7 to 5), 238(12 to 5), 255(8 to 4), 258(8 to 3), 259(10 to 7), 291(3 to 7), 338(11 to 1), 343(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 10.000000), (258: 130.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(235: 5), (238: 3), (255: 2), (258: 6), (259: 3), (291: 1), (338: 3), (343: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
