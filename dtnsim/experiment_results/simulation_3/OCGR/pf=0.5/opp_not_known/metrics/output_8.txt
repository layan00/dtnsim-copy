The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1549(7 to 5), 1550(12 to 5), 1564(8 to 4), 1565(8 to 3), 1566(10 to 7), 1601(3 to 7), 1646(11 to 1), 1649(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1550: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1549: 5), (1550: 4), (1564: 2), (1565: 2), (1566: 1), (1601: 1), (1646: 3), (1649: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
