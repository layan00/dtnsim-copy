The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1980(7 to 5), 1981(12 to 5), 1997(8 to 4), 1998(8 to 3), 1999(10 to 7), 2037(3 to 7), 2080(11 to 1), 2083(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1980: 5), (1981: 4), (1997: 3), (1998: 3), (1999: 2), (2037: 1), (2080: 3), (2083: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
