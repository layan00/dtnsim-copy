The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
685(7 to 5), 687(12 to 5), 703(8 to 4), 704(8 to 3), 705(10 to 7), 736(3 to 7), 786(11 to 1), 789(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(687: 50.000000), (789: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(685: 2), (687: 4), (703: 2), (704: 2), (705: 1), (736: 4), (786: 3), (789: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
