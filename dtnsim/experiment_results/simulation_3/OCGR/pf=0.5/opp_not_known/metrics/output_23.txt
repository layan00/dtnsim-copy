The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1571(7 to 5), 1577(12 to 5), 1592(8 to 4), 1593(8 to 3), 1594(10 to 7), 1626(3 to 7), 1671(11 to 1), 1674(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1671: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1571: 7), (1577: 4), (1592: 2), (1593: 2), (1594: 3), (1626: 2), (1671: 3), (1674: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
