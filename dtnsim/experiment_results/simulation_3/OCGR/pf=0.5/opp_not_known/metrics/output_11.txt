The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
682(7 to 5), 684(12 to 5), 698(8 to 4), 699(8 to 3), 700(10 to 7), 726(3 to 7), 775(11 to 1), 778(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(684: 50.000000), (775: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(682: 2), (684: 4), (698: 2), (699: 2), (700: 3), (726: 1), (775: 3), (778: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
