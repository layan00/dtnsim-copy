The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
235(7 to 5), 237(12 to 5), 255(8 to 4), 257(8 to 3), 258(10 to 7), 286(3 to 7), 334(11 to 1), 340(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(237: 50.000000), (258: 50.000000), (334: 20.000000), (340: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(235: 5), (237: 4), (255: 2), (257: 2), (258: 6), (286: 1), (334: 3), (340: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
