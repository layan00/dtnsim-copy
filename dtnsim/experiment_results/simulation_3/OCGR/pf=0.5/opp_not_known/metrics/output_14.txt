The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2002(7 to 5), 2003(12 to 5), 2020(8 to 4), 2022(8 to 3), 2023(10 to 7), 2059(3 to 7), 2104(11 to 1), 2111(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2003: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2002: 4), (2003: 3), (2020: 2), (2022: 2), (2023: 5), (2059: 4), (2104: 3), (2111: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
