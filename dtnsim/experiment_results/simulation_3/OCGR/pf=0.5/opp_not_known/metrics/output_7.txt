The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1117(7 to 5), 1119(12 to 5), 1136(8 to 4), 1139(8 to 3), 1140(10 to 7), 1169(3 to 7), 1212(11 to 1), 1215(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1119: 10.000000), (1136: 120.000000), (1139: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1117: 5), (1119: 3), (1136: 4), (1139: 3), (1140: 2), (1169: 2), (1212: 3), (1215: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
