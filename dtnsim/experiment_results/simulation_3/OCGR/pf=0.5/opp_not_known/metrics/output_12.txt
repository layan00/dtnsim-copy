The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1114(7 to 5), 1115(12 to 5), 1130(8 to 4), 1132(8 to 3), 1133(10 to 7), 1166(3 to 7), 1212(11 to 1), 1215(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1115: 10.000000), (1212: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1114: 4), (1115: 3), (1130: 2), (1132: 2), (1133: 1), (1166: 1), (1212: 3), (1215: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
