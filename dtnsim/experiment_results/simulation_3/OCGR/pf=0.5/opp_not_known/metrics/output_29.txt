The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2007(7 to 5), 2008(12 to 5), 2025(8 to 4), 2027(8 to 3), 2028(10 to 7), 2065(3 to 7), 2109(11 to 1), 2112(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2007: 60.000000), (2008: 10.000000), (2025: 120.000000), (2027: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2007: 6), (2008: 3), (2025: 3), (2027: 2), (2028: 1), (2065: 4), (2109: 3), (2112: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
