The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1542(7 to 5), 1543(12 to 5), 1562(8 to 4), 1564(8 to 3), 1565(10 to 7), 1604(3 to 7), 1652(11 to 1), 1657(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1543: 10.000000), (1564: 130.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1542: 6), (1543: 3), (1562: 2), (1564: 6), (1565: 1), (1604: 4), (1652: 3), (1657: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 44 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
