The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1116(7 to 5), 1117(12 to 5), 1135(8 to 4), 1137(8 to 3), 1138(10 to 7), 1169(3 to 7), 1216(11 to 1), 1219(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1117: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1116: 5), (1117: 3), (1135: 3), (1137: 3), (1138: 3), (1169: 1), (1216: 3), (1219: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
