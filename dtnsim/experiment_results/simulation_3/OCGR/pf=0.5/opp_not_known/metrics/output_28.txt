The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1561(7 to 5), 1562(12 to 5), 1578(8 to 4), 1579(8 to 3), 1580(10 to 7), 1617(3 to 7), 1665(11 to 1), 1668(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1579: 130.000000), (1665: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1561: 4), (1562: 4), (1578: 2), (1579: 5), (1580: 3), (1617: 2), (1665: 3), (1668: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
