The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1561(7 to 5), 1564(12 to 5), 1579(8 to 4), 1580(8 to 3), 1581(10 to 7), 1610(3 to 7), 1653(11 to 1), 1656(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1653: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1561: 3), (1564: 4), (1579: 3), (1580: 3), (1581: 2), (1610: 1), (1653: 3), (1656: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
