The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2013(7 to 5), 2014(12 to 5), 2030(8 to 4), 2032(8 to 3), 2033(10 to 7), 2071(3 to 7), 2119(11 to 1), 2124(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2014: 10.000000), (2032: 130.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2013: 5), (2014: 3), (2030: 2), (2032: 6), (2033: 2), (2071: 1), (2119: 3), (2124: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
