The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
91(7 to 5), 94(12 to 5), 100(8 to 4), 102(8 to 3), 103(10 to 7), 105(3 to 7), 113(11 to 1), 115(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(91: 4), (94: 2), (100: 2), (102: 2), (103: 4), (105: 1), (113: 2), (115: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 91: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 91: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
