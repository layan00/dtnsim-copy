The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
349(7 to 5), 350(12 to 5), 351(8 to 4), 352(8 to 3), 353(10 to 7), 355(3 to 7), 362(11 to 1), 363(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(352: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(349: 1), (350: 2), (351: 4), (352: 3), (353: 3), (355: 1), (362: 1), (363: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 363: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
