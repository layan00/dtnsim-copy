The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
369(7 to 5), 370(12 to 5), 373(8 to 4), 375(8 to 3), 376(10 to 7), 383(3 to 7), 389(11 to 1), 390(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(369: 1), (370: 4), (373: 3), (375: 3), (376: 2), (383: 1), (389: 1), (390: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
