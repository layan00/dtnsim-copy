The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
90(7 to 5), 91(12 to 5), 95(8 to 4), 96(8 to 3), 97(10 to 7), 103(3 to 7), 111(11 to 1), 115(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(111: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(90: 1), (91: 2), (95: 2), (96: 2), (97: 4), (103: 3), (111: 3), (115: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
