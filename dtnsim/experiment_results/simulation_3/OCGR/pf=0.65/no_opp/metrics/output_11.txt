The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(7 to 5), 222(12 to 5), 225(8 to 4), 226(8 to 3), 227(10 to 7), 229(3 to 7), 238(11 to 1), 240(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 2), (222: 2), (225: 2), (226: 2), (227: 3), (229: 1), (238: 3), (240: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 220: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 240: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
