The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
349(7 to 5), 350(12 to 5), 353(8 to 4), 354(8 to 3), 355(10 to 7), 363(3 to 7), 372(11 to 1), 376(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(349: 1), (350: 3), (353: 2), (354: 2), (355: 4), (363: 3), (372: 2), (376: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
