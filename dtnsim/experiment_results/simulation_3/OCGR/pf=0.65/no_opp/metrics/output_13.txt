The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(7 to 5), 482(12 to 5), 484(8 to 4), 485(8 to 3), 486(10 to 7), 490(3 to 7), 502(11 to 1), 504(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(504: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 1), (482: 2), (484: 2), (485: 2), (486: 2), (490: 1), (502: 3), (504: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 504: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
