The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(7 to 5), 214(12 to 5), 216(8 to 4), 217(8 to 3), 218(10 to 7), 222(3 to 7), 226(11 to 1), 227(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 2), (214: 2), (216: 3), (217: 3), (218: 2), (222: 1), (226: 1), (227: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
