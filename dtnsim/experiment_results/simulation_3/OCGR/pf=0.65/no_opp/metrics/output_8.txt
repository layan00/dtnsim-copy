The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
466(7 to 5), 467(12 to 5), 469(8 to 4), 470(8 to 3), 471(10 to 7), 478(3 to 7), 486(11 to 1), 488(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(466: 1), (467: 2), (469: 2), (470: 2), (471: 3), (478: 2), (486: 2), (488: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
