The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
326(7 to 5), 327(12 to 5), 331(8 to 4), 332(8 to 3), 333(10 to 7), 336(3 to 7), 342(11 to 1), 343(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(326: 1), (327: 2), (331: 2), (332: 2), (333: 2), (336: 1), (342: 1), (343: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 343: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
