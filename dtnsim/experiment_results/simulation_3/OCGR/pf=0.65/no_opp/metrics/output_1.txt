The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(7 to 5), 229(12 to 5), 233(8 to 4), 235(8 to 3), 236(10 to 7), 243(3 to 7), 251(11 to 1), 258(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 50.000000), (243: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 2), (229: 3), (233: 3), (235: 3), (236: 5), (243: 4), (251: 1), (258: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
