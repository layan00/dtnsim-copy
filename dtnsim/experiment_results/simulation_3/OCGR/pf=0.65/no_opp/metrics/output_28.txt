The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
457(7 to 5), 458(12 to 5), 462(8 to 4), 463(8 to 3), 464(10 to 7), 470(3 to 7), 477(11 to 1), 478(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(457: 1), (458: 2), (462: 2), (463: 2), (464: 2), (470: 1), (477: 1), (478: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
