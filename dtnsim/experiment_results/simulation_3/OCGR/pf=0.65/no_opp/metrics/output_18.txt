The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
446(7 to 5), 447(12 to 5), 454(8 to 4), 455(8 to 3), 456(10 to 7), 465(3 to 7), 469(11 to 1), 470(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(446: 1), (447: 2), (454: 2), (455: 2), (456: 2), (465: 1), (469: 1), (470: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
