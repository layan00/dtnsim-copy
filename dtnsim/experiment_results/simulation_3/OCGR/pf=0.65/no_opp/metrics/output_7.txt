The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
343(7 to 5), 345(12 to 5), 349(8 to 4), 350(8 to 3), 351(10 to 7), 354(3 to 7), 361(11 to 1), 363(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(349: 120.000000), (350: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(343: 2), (345: 2), (349: 4), (350: 3), (351: 2), (354: 2), (361: 3), (363: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
