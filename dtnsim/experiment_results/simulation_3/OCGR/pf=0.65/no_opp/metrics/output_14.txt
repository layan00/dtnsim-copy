The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
609(7 to 5), 610(12 to 5), 614(8 to 4), 615(8 to 3), 616(10 to 7), 623(3 to 7), 631(11 to 1), 635(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(609: 1), (610: 2), (614: 2), (615: 2), (616: 2), (623: 4), (631: 2), (635: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
