The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
564(7 to 5), 565(12 to 5), 569(8 to 4), 570(8 to 3), 571(10 to 7), 580(3 to 7), 586(11 to 1), 587(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(570: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(564: 1), (565: 2), (569: 3), (570: 2), (571: 3), (580: 2), (586: 1), (587: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
