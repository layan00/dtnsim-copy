The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(7 to 5), 221(12 to 5), 224(8 to 4), 226(8 to 3), 227(10 to 7), 234(3 to 7), 242(11 to 1), 244(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 4), (221: 3), (224: 2), (226: 2), (227: 2), (234: 1), (242: 2), (244: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
