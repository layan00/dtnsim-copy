The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
502(7 to 5), 504(12 to 5), 508(8 to 4), 510(8 to 3), 511(10 to 7), 518(3 to 7), 526(11 to 1), 527(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(502: 2), (504: 3), (508: 2), (510: 2), (511: 3), (518: 2), (526: 1), (527: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
