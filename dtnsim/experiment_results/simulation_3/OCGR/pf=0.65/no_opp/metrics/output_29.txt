The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
584(7 to 5), 585(12 to 5), 590(8 to 4), 591(8 to 3), 592(10 to 7), 600(3 to 7), 604(11 to 1), 606(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(590: 120.000000), (591: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(584: 1), (585: 2), (590: 3), (591: 2), (592: 2), (600: 1), (604: 3), (606: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
