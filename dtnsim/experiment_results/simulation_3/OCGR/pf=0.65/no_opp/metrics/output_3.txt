The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
460(7 to 5), 462(12 to 5), 465(8 to 4), 466(8 to 3), 467(10 to 7), 470(3 to 7), 476(11 to 1), 479(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(460: 2), (462: 2), (465: 2), (466: 2), (467: 2), (470: 3), (476: 2), (479: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
