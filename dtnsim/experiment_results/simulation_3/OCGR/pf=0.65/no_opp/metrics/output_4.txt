The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
580(7 to 5), 583(12 to 5), 589(8 to 4), 591(8 to 3), 592(10 to 7), 598(3 to 7), 602(11 to 1), 603(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(589: 120.000000), (591: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(580: 4), (583: 2), (589: 3), (591: 2), (592: 2), (598: 1), (602: 1), (603: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 580: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
