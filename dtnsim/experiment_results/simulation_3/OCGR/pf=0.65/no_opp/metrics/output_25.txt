The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
83(7 to 5), 86(12 to 5), 89(8 to 4), 91(8 to 3), 92(10 to 7), 101(3 to 7), 104(11 to 1), 105(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(83: 4), (86: 4), (89: 2), (91: 2), (92: 2), (101: 1), (104: 1), (105: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
