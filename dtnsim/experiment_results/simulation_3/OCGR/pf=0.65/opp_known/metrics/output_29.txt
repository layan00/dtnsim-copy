The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1473(7 to 5), 1474(12 to 5), 1481(8 to 4), 1483(8 to 3), 1484(10 to 7), 1509(3 to 7), 1529(11 to 1), 1532(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1473: 60.000000), (1474: 10.000000), (1481: 120.000000), (1483: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1473: 6), (1474: 3), (1481: 3), (1483: 3), (1484: 4), (1509: 4), (1529: 3), (1532: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
