The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(7 to 5), 218(12 to 5), 223(8 to 4), 226(8 to 3), 227(10 to 7), 251(3 to 7), 266(11 to 1), 269(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 10.000000), (227: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 5), (218: 3), (223: 2), (226: 4), (227: 6), (251: 1), (266: 3), (269: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
