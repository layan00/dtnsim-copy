The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
855(7 to 5), 856(12 to 5), 861(8 to 4), 863(8 to 3), 864(10 to 7), 888(3 to 7), 908(11 to 1), 911(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(856: 10.000000), (864: 10.000000), (908: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(855: 4), (856: 3), (861: 2), (863: 2), (864: 6), (888: 1), (908: 3), (911: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
