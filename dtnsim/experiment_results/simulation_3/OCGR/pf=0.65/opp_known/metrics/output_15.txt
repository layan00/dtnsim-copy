The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(7 to 5), 226(12 to 5), 234(8 to 4), 236(8 to 3), 237(10 to 7), 254(3 to 7), 273(11 to 1), 276(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(226: 50.000000), (237: 10.000000), (273: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 5), (226: 4), (234: 2), (236: 2), (237: 3), (254: 1), (273: 3), (276: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
