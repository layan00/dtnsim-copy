The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
834(7 to 5), 835(12 to 5), 840(8 to 4), 841(8 to 3), 842(10 to 7), 861(3 to 7), 879(11 to 1), 882(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(842: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(834: 4), (835: 4), (840: 2), (841: 2), (842: 3), (861: 1), (879: 3), (882: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
