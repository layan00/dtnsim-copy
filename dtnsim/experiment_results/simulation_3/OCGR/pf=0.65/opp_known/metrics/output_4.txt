The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1461(7 to 5), 1467(12 to 5), 1475(8 to 4), 1478(8 to 3), 1479(10 to 7), 1499(3 to 7), 1516(11 to 1), 1521(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1461: 20.000000), (1467: 10.000000), (1475: 120.000000), (1479: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1461: 6), (1467: 3), (1475: 3), (1478: 5), (1479: 3), (1499: 1), (1516: 3), (1521: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
