The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
839(7 to 5), 840(12 to 5), 847(8 to 4), 849(8 to 3), 850(10 to 7), 872(3 to 7), 891(11 to 1), 894(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(840: 10.000000), (850: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(839: 5), (840: 3), (847: 3), (849: 4), (850: 3), (872: 1), (891: 3), (894: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
