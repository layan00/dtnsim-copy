The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1152(7 to 5), 1153(12 to 5), 1156(8 to 4), 1157(8 to 3), 1158(10 to 7), 1180(3 to 7), 1200(11 to 1), 1203(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1153: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1152: 5), (1153: 4), (1156: 2), (1157: 2), (1158: 4), (1180: 1), (1200: 3), (1203: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
