The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1490(7 to 5), 1491(12 to 5), 1497(8 to 4), 1498(8 to 3), 1499(10 to 7), 1523(3 to 7), 1543(11 to 1), 1548(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1499: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1490: 4), (1491: 4), (1497: 2), (1498: 5), (1499: 3), (1523: 1), (1543: 3), (1548: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
