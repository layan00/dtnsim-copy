The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
530(7 to 5), 532(12 to 5), 536(8 to 4), 538(8 to 3), 539(10 to 7), 556(3 to 7), 572(11 to 1), 575(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(532: 10.000000), (538: 130.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(530: 3), (532: 3), (536: 3), (538: 7), (539: 4), (556: 1), (572: 3), (575: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
