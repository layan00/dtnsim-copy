The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1455(7 to 5), 1456(12 to 5), 1462(8 to 4), 1464(8 to 3), 1465(10 to 7), 1488(3 to 7), 1508(11 to 1), 1511(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1456: 10.000000), (1464: 90.000000), (1508: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1455: 4), (1456: 3), (1462: 3), (1464: 3), (1465: 4), (1488: 4), (1508: 3), (1511: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
