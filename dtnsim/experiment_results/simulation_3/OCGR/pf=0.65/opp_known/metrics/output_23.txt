The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1199(7 to 5), 1201(12 to 5), 1206(8 to 4), 1208(8 to 3), 1209(10 to 7), 1230(3 to 7), 1249(11 to 1), 1252(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1249: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1199: 6), (1201: 4), (1206: 2), (1208: 2), (1209: 4), (1230: 1), (1249: 3), (1252: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
