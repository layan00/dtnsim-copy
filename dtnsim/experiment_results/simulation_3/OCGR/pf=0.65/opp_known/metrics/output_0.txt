The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
226(7 to 5), 227(12 to 5), 232(8 to 4), 233(8 to 3), 234(10 to 7), 261(3 to 7), 282(11 to 1), 285(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(233: 90.000000), (234: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(226: 6), (227: 4), (232: 3), (233: 3), (234: 3), (261: 4), (282: 3), (285: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
