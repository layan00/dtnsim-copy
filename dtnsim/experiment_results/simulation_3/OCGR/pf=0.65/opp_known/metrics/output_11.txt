The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
542(7 to 5), 544(12 to 5), 548(8 to 4), 549(8 to 3), 550(10 to 7), 567(3 to 7), 588(11 to 1), 591(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(544: 50.000000), (550: 10.000000), (588: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(542: 3), (544: 4), (548: 2), (549: 2), (550: 3), (567: 1), (588: 3), (591: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
