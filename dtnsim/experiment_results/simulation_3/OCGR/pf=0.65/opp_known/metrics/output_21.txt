The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
550(7 to 5), 552(12 to 5), 558(8 to 4), 560(8 to 3), 561(10 to 7), 583(3 to 7), 607(11 to 1), 610(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(552: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(550: 6), (552: 4), (558: 2), (560: 2), (561: 4), (583: 4), (607: 3), (610: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
