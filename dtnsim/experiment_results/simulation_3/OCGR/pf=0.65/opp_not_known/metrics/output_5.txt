The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
226(7 to 5), 227(12 to 5), 242(8 to 4), 244(8 to 3), 245(10 to 7), 277(3 to 7), 321(11 to 1), 326(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(226: 4), (227: 3), (242: 2), (244: 2), (245: 4), (277: 3), (321: 3), (326: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
