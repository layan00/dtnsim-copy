The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1064(7 to 5), 1066(12 to 5), 1082(8 to 4), 1083(8 to 3), 1084(10 to 7), 1111(3 to 7), 1154(11 to 1), 1157(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1082: 120.000000), (1083: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1064: 2), (1066: 4), (1082: 4), (1083: 3), (1084: 2), (1111: 2), (1154: 3), (1157: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
