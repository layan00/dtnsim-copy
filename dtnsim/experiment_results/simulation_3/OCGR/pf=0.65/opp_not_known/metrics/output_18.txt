The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1468(7 to 5), 1469(12 to 5), 1487(8 to 4), 1489(8 to 3), 1490(10 to 7), 1527(3 to 7), 1570(11 to 1), 1573(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1469: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1468: 6), (1469: 3), (1487: 2), (1489: 2), (1490: 1), (1527: 4), (1570: 3), (1573: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
