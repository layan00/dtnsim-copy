The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
644(7 to 5), 646(12 to 5), 660(8 to 4), 662(8 to 3), 663(10 to 7), 691(3 to 7), 731(11 to 1), 734(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(646: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(644: 2), (646: 3), (660: 3), (662: 3), (663: 2), (691: 1), (731: 3), (734: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
