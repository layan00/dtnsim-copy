The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
661(7 to 5), 663(12 to 5), 678(8 to 4), 679(8 to 3), 680(10 to 7), 710(3 to 7), 753(11 to 1), 756(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(661: 2), (663: 4), (678: 3), (679: 3), (680: 1), (710: 1), (753: 3), (756: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
