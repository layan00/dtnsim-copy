The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1092(7 to 5), 1093(12 to 5), 1107(8 to 4), 1108(8 to 3), 1109(10 to 7), 1143(3 to 7), 1188(11 to 1), 1191(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1092: 6), (1093: 4), (1107: 3), (1108: 3), (1109: 2), (1143: 4), (1188: 3), (1191: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 47 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
