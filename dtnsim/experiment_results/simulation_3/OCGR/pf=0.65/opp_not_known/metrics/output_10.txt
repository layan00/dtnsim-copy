The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(7 to 5), 229(12 to 5), 243(8 to 4), 244(8 to 3), 245(10 to 7), 279(3 to 7), 322(11 to 1), 325(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 50.000000), (322: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 4), (229: 4), (243: 3), (244: 3), (245: 3), (279: 1), (322: 3), (325: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
