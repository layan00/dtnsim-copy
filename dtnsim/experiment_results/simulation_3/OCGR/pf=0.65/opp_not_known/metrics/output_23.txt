The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1523(7 to 5), 1525(12 to 5), 1540(8 to 4), 1542(8 to 3), 1543(10 to 7), 1576(3 to 7), 1620(11 to 1), 1623(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1620: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1523: 5), (1525: 4), (1540: 2), (1542: 2), (1543: 3), (1576: 2), (1620: 3), (1623: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
