The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1893(7 to 5), 1894(12 to 5), 1910(8 to 4), 1911(8 to 3), 1912(10 to 7), 1947(3 to 7), 1987(11 to 1), 1990(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1893: 5), (1894: 4), (1910: 2), (1911: 2), (1912: 2), (1947: 1), (1987: 3), (1990: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
