The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1918(7 to 5), 1919(12 to 5), 1935(8 to 4), 1936(8 to 3), 1937(10 to 7), 1970(3 to 7), 2014(11 to 1), 2019(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1918: 4), (1919: 4), (1935: 2), (1936: 2), (1937: 2), (1970: 4), (2014: 3), (2019: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
