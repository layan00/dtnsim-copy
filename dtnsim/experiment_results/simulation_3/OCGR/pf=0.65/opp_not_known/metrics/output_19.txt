The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1887(7 to 5), 1888(12 to 5), 1904(8 to 4), 1906(8 to 3), 1907(10 to 7), 1942(3 to 7), 1984(11 to 1), 1987(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1888: 10.000000), (1906: 90.000000), (1984: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1887: 4), (1888: 3), (1904: 3), (1906: 2), (1907: 3), (1942: 2), (1984: 3), (1987: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
