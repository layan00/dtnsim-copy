The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1071(7 to 5), 1072(12 to 5), 1085(8 to 4), 1086(8 to 3), 1087(10 to 7), 1115(3 to 7), 1159(11 to 1), 1162(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1072: 50.000000), (1086: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1071: 4), (1072: 4), (1085: 4), (1086: 3), (1087: 3), (1115: 1), (1159: 3), (1162: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
