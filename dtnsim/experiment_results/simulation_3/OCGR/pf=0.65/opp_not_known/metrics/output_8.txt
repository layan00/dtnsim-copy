The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1479(7 to 5), 1480(12 to 5), 1493(8 to 4), 1494(8 to 3), 1495(10 to 7), 1528(3 to 7), 1572(11 to 1), 1575(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1480: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1479: 5), (1480: 4), (1493: 2), (1494: 2), (1495: 1), (1528: 1), (1572: 3), (1575: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
