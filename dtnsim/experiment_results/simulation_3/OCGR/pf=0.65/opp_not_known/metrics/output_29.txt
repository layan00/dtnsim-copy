The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1899(7 to 5), 1900(12 to 5), 1917(8 to 4), 1919(8 to 3), 1920(10 to 7), 1956(3 to 7), 2000(11 to 1), 2003(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1899: 60.000000), (1900: 10.000000), (1917: 120.000000), (1919: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1899: 6), (1900: 3), (1917: 3), (1919: 2), (1920: 1), (1956: 4), (2000: 3), (2003: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
