The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1072(7 to 5), 1073(12 to 5), 1088(8 to 4), 1090(8 to 3), 1091(10 to 7), 1123(3 to 7), 1167(11 to 1), 1170(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1073: 10.000000), (1167: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1072: 4), (1073: 3), (1088: 2), (1090: 2), (1091: 1), (1123: 1), (1167: 3), (1170: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
