The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1051(7 to 5), 1052(12 to 5), 1069(8 to 4), 1071(8 to 3), 1072(10 to 7), 1103(3 to 7), 1147(11 to 1), 1150(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1052: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1051: 5), (1052: 3), (1069: 3), (1071: 3), (1072: 3), (1103: 1), (1147: 3), (1150: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
