The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
631(7 to 5), 633(12 to 5), 650(8 to 4), 652(8 to 3), 653(10 to 7), 683(3 to 7), 726(11 to 1), 729(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(633: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(631: 5), (633: 4), (650: 3), (652: 3), (653: 3), (683: 1), (726: 3), (729: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
