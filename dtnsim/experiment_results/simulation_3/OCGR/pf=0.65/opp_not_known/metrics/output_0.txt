The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
230(7 to 5), 231(12 to 5), 246(8 to 4), 247(8 to 3), 248(10 to 7), 284(3 to 7), 329(11 to 1), 332(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(230: 6), (231: 4), (246: 4), (247: 3), (248: 2), (284: 4), (329: 3), (332: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
