The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
647(7 to 5), 650(12 to 5), 665(8 to 4), 667(8 to 3), 668(10 to 7), 698(3 to 7), 742(11 to 1), 745(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(647: 4), (650: 4), (665: 2), (667: 2), (668: 2), (698: 1), (742: 3), (745: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
