The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(7 to 5), 239(12 to 5), 253(8 to 4), 254(8 to 3), 255(10 to 7), 287(3 to 7), 333(11 to 1), 336(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(239: 50.000000), (336: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 2), (239: 4), (253: 2), (254: 2), (255: 1), (287: 1), (333: 3), (336: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
