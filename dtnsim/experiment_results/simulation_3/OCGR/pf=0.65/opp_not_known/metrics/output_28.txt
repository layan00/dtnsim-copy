The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1476(7 to 5), 1477(12 to 5), 1493(8 to 4), 1494(8 to 3), 1495(10 to 7), 1527(3 to 7), 1570(11 to 1), 1573(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1476: 4), (1477: 4), (1493: 2), (1494: 2), (1495: 2), (1527: 1), (1570: 3), (1573: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
