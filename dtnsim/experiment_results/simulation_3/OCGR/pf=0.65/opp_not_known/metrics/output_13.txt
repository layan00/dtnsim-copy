The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1496(7 to 5), 1497(12 to 5), 1511(8 to 4), 1512(8 to 3), 1513(10 to 7), 1543(3 to 7), 1591(11 to 1), 1594(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1594: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1496: 4), (1497: 4), (1511: 2), (1512: 2), (1513: 2), (1543: 1), (1591: 3), (1594: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
