The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(7 to 5), 666(12 to 5), 682(8 to 4), 683(8 to 3), 684(10 to 7), 715(3 to 7), 763(11 to 1), 766(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(666: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(664: 2), (666: 4), (682: 2), (683: 2), (684: 1), (715: 4), (763: 3), (766: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
