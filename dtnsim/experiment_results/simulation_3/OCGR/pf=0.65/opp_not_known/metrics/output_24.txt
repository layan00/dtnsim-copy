The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1946(7 to 5), 1947(12 to 5), 1962(8 to 4), 1964(8 to 3), 1965(10 to 7), 1999(3 to 7), 2042(11 to 1), 2045(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1947: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1946: 4), (1947: 3), (1962: 2), (1964: 2), (1965: 2), (1999: 2), (2042: 3), (2045: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
