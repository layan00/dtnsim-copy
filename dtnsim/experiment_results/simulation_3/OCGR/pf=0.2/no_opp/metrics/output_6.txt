The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
317(7 to 5), 320(12 to 5), 327(8 to 4), 329(8 to 3), 330(10 to 7), 347(3 to 7), 365(11 to 1), 373(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(317: 60.000000), (320: 50.000000), (330: 50.000000), (347: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(317: 5), (320: 5), (327: 2), (329: 2), (330: 5), (347: 4), (365: 2), (373: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
