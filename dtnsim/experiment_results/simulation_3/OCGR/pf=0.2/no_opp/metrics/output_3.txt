The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
702(7 to 5), 705(12 to 5), 711(8 to 4), 712(8 to 3), 713(10 to 7), 723(3 to 7), 737(11 to 1), 742(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(723: 35.000000), (737: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(702: 3), (705: 2), (711: 2), (712: 2), (713: 2), (723: 4), (737: 3), (742: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
