The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
898(7 to 5), 899(12 to 5), 908(8 to 4), 910(8 to 3), 911(10 to 7), 927(3 to 7), 942(11 to 1), 950(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(899: 50.000000), (908: 120.000000), (910: 90.000000), (911: 50.000000), (927: 35.000000), (942: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(898: 1), (899: 4), (908: 3), (910: 2), (911: 5), (927: 4), (942: 3), (950: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
