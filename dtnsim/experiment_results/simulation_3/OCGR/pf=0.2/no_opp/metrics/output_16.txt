The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
302(7 to 5), 305(12 to 5), 311(8 to 4), 313(8 to 3), 314(10 to 7), 328(3 to 7), 339(11 to 1), 340(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(313: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(302: 4), (305: 4), (311: 3), (313: 2), (314: 3), (328: 2), (339: 1), (340: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
