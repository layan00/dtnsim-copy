The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
710(7 to 5), 713(12 to 5), 719(8 to 4), 720(8 to 3), 721(10 to 7), 735(3 to 7), 749(11 to 1), 753(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(719: 120.000000), (720: 90.000000), (749: 80.000000), (753: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(710: 3), (713: 2), (719: 3), (720: 2), (721: 4), (735: 3), (749: 3), (753: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
