The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
897(7 to 5), 898(12 to 5), 904(8 to 4), 905(8 to 3), 906(10 to 7), 924(3 to 7), 935(11 to 1), 943(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(906: 50.000000), (924: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(897: 1), (898: 5), (904: 2), (905: 2), (906: 5), (924: 4), (935: 2), (943: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
