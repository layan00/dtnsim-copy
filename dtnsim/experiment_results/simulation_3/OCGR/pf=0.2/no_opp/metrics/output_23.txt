The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
713(7 to 5), 716(12 to 5), 721(8 to 4), 724(8 to 3), 725(10 to 7), 740(3 to 7), 754(11 to 1), 756(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(721: 120.000000), (724: 90.000000), (754: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(713: 5), (716: 4), (721: 3), (724: 2), (725: 3), (740: 2), (754: 3), (756: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
