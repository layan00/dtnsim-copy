The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
122(7 to 5), 125(12 to 5), 134(8 to 4), 137(8 to 3), 138(10 to 7), 149(3 to 7), 164(11 to 1), 166(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(122: 60.000000), (125: 50.000000), (164: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(122: 5), (125: 4), (134: 2), (137: 2), (138: 2), (149: 1), (164: 3), (166: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
