The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
855(7 to 5), 857(12 to 5), 866(8 to 4), 868(8 to 3), 869(10 to 7), 881(3 to 7), 896(11 to 1), 904(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(868: 90.000000), (869: 50.000000), (881: 35.000000), (904: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(855: 2), (857: 4), (866: 3), (868: 2), (869: 5), (881: 4), (896: 2), (904: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
