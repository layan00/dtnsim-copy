The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
129(7 to 5), 132(12 to 5), 141(8 to 4), 144(8 to 3), 145(10 to 7), 159(3 to 7), 174(11 to 1), 178(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(129: 60.000000), (132: 50.000000), (141: 120.000000), (144: 90.000000), (174: 80.000000), (178: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(129: 5), (132: 4), (141: 3), (144: 2), (145: 4), (159: 3), (174: 3), (178: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
