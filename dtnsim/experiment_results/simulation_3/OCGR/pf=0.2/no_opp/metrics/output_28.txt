The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
707(7 to 5), 710(12 to 5), 716(8 to 4), 717(8 to 3), 718(10 to 7), 730(3 to 7), 744(11 to 1), 752(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(718: 50.000000), (730: 35.000000), (744: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(707: 3), (710: 2), (716: 2), (717: 2), (718: 5), (730: 4), (744: 3), (752: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
