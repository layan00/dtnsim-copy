The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
330(7 to 5), 332(12 to 5), 340(8 to 4), 342(8 to 3), 343(10 to 7), 358(3 to 7), 372(11 to 1), 380(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(332: 50.000000), (343: 50.000000), (358: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(330: 2), (332: 4), (340: 2), (342: 2), (343: 5), (358: 4), (372: 2), (380: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
