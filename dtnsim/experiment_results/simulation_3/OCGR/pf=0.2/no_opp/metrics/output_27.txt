The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
516(7 to 5), 517(12 to 5), 525(8 to 4), 526(8 to 3), 527(10 to 7), 536(3 to 7), 551(11 to 1), 555(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(525: 120.000000), (526: 90.000000), (551: 80.000000), (555: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(516: 1), (517: 2), (525: 4), (526: 3), (527: 4), (536: 3), (551: 3), (555: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
