The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
324(7 to 5), 327(12 to 5), 334(8 to 4), 337(8 to 3), 338(10 to 7), 351(3 to 7), 366(11 to 1), 374(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(324: 60.000000), (327: 50.000000), (338: 50.000000), (351: 35.000000), (366: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(324: 5), (327: 4), (334: 3), (337: 3), (338: 5), (351: 4), (366: 3), (374: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
