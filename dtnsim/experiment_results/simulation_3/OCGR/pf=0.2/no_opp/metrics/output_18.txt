The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
667(7 to 5), 670(12 to 5), 678(8 to 4), 679(8 to 3), 680(10 to 7), 693(3 to 7), 707(11 to 1), 711(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(679: 90.000000), (711: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(667: 3), (670: 2), (678: 3), (679: 2), (680: 4), (693: 3), (707: 2), (711: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
