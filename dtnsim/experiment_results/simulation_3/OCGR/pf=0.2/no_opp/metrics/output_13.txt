The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(7 to 5), 657(12 to 5), 664(8 to 4), 667(8 to 3), 668(10 to 7), 685(3 to 7), 702(11 to 1), 706(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(654: 60.000000), (657: 50.000000), (664: 120.000000), (667: 90.000000), (706: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 5), (657: 4), (664: 3), (667: 2), (668: 4), (685: 3), (702: 3), (706: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
