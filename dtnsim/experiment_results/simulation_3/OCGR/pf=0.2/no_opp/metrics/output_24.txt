The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
912(7 to 5), 915(12 to 5), 924(8 to 4), 927(8 to 3), 928(10 to 7), 945(3 to 7), 961(11 to 1), 963(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(912: 60.000000), (915: 50.000000), (924: 120.000000), (927: 90.000000), (961: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(912: 5), (915: 4), (924: 3), (927: 2), (928: 3), (945: 2), (961: 3), (963: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
