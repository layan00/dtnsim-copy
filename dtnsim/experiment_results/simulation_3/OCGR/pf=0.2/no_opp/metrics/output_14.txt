The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
852(7 to 5), 855(12 to 5), 863(8 to 4), 865(8 to 3), 866(10 to 7), 884(3 to 7), 899(11 to 1), 905(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(852: 60.000000), (855: 50.000000), (865: 90.000000), (905: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(852: 5), (855: 5), (863: 3), (865: 2), (866: 5), (884: 4), (899: 2), (905: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
