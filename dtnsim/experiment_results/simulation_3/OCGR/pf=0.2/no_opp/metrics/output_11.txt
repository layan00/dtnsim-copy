The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
296(7 to 5), 298(12 to 5), 304(8 to 4), 305(8 to 3), 306(10 to 7), 311(3 to 7), 323(11 to 1), 325(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(323: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(296: 2), (298: 2), (304: 2), (305: 2), (306: 3), (311: 1), (323: 3), (325: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 296: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
