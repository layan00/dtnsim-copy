The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
881(7 to 5), 884(12 to 5), 891(8 to 4), 893(8 to 3), 894(10 to 7), 906(3 to 7), 916(11 to 1), 918(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(891: 120.000000), (893: 90.000000), (916: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(881: 4), (884: 4), (891: 3), (893: 2), (894: 3), (906: 2), (916: 3), (918: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
