The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
518(7 to 5), 519(12 to 5), 525(8 to 4), 527(8 to 3), 528(10 to 7), 542(3 to 7), 554(11 to 1), 562(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(519: 50.000000), (525: 120.000000), (527: 90.000000), (528: 50.000000), (542: 35.000000), (554: 80.000000), (562: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(518: 1), (519: 4), (525: 3), (527: 2), (528: 5), (542: 4), (554: 3), (562: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
