The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
322(7 to 5), 325(12 to 5), 333(8 to 4), 336(8 to 3), 337(10 to 7), 354(3 to 7), 370(11 to 1), 377(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(322: 60.000000), (325: 50.000000), (333: 120.000000), (336: 90.000000), (337: 50.000000), (354: 35.000000), (377: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(322: 5), (325: 4), (333: 3), (336: 2), (337: 5), (354: 4), (370: 1), (377: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
