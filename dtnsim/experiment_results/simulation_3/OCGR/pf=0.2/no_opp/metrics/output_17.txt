The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
478(7 to 5), 481(12 to 5), 488(8 to 4), 489(8 to 3), 490(10 to 7), 503(3 to 7), 517(11 to 1), 525(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(489: 90.000000), (490: 50.000000), (503: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(478: 3), (481: 2), (488: 3), (489: 2), (490: 5), (503: 4), (517: 2), (525: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
