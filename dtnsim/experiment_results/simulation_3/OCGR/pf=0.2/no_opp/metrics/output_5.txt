The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
124(7 to 5), 127(12 to 5), 133(8 to 4), 134(8 to 3), 135(10 to 7), 149(3 to 7), 161(11 to 1), 169(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(133: 120.000000), (134: 90.000000), (135: 50.000000), (149: 35.000000), (161: 80.000000), (169: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(124: 3), (127: 2), (133: 3), (134: 2), (135: 5), (149: 4), (161: 3), (169: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
