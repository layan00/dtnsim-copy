The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2202(7 to 5), 2208(12 to 5), 2227(8 to 4), 2230(8 to 3), 2231(10 to 7), 2264(3 to 7), 2309(11 to 1), 2312(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2202: 20.000000), (2208: 10.000000), (2227: 120.000000), (2230: 90.000000), (2309: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2202: 6), (2208: 3), (2227: 3), (2230: 2), (2231: 1), (2264: 1), (2309: 3), (2312: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
