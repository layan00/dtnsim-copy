The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
265(7 to 5), 271(12 to 5), 289(8 to 4), 292(8 to 3), 293(10 to 7), 330(3 to 7), 388(11 to 1), 393(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(265: 20.000000), (271: 10.000000), (292: 130.000000), (330: 0.000000), (393: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(265: 6), (271: 3), (289: 2), (292: 6), (293: 1), (330: 6), (388: 3), (393: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
