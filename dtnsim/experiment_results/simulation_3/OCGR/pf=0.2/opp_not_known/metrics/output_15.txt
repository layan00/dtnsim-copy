The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
258(7 to 5), 261(12 to 5), 281(8 to 4), 284(8 to 3), 285(10 to 7), 319(3 to 7), 371(11 to 1), 376(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(258: 60.000000), (261: 10.000000), (284: 70.000000), (371: 20.000000), (376: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(258: 6), (261: 3), (281: 2), (284: 5), (285: 2), (319: 1), (371: 3), (376: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
