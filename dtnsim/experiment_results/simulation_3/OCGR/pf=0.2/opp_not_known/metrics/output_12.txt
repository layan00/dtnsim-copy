The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1206(7 to 5), 1207(12 to 5), 1225(8 to 4), 1227(8 to 3), 1228(10 to 7), 1263(3 to 7), 1313(11 to 1), 1316(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1207: 10.000000), (1313: 20.000000), (1316: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1206: 5), (1207: 3), (1225: 3), (1227: 3), (1228: 1), (1263: 1), (1313: 3), (1316: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
