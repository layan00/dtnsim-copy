The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
735(7 to 5), 737(12 to 5), 754(8 to 4), 756(8 to 3), 757(10 to 7), 789(3 to 7), 844(11 to 1), 847(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(735: 40.000000), (737: 50.000000), (789: 0.000000), (844: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(735: 5), (737: 4), (754: 2), (756: 2), (757: 3), (789: 6), (844: 3), (847: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
