The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1208(7 to 5), 1214(12 to 5), 1232(8 to 4), 1235(8 to 3), 1236(10 to 7), 1272(3 to 7), 1329(11 to 1), 1334(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1208: 20.000000), (1214: 10.000000), (1235: 70.000000), (1272: 0.000000), (1334: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1208: 6), (1214: 3), (1232: 2), (1235: 5), (1236: 1), (1272: 6), (1329: 3), (1334: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
