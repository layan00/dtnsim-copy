The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
737(7 to 5), 743(12 to 5), 761(8 to 4), 764(8 to 3), 765(10 to 7), 800(3 to 7), 846(11 to 1), 849(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(737: 20.000000), (743: 10.000000), (764: 90.000000), (846: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(737: 6), (743: 3), (761: 3), (764: 2), (765: 1), (800: 1), (846: 3), (849: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
