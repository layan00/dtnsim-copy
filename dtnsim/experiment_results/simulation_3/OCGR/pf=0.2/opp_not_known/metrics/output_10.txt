The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
256(7 to 5), 257(12 to 5), 275(8 to 4), 276(8 to 3), 277(10 to 7), 317(3 to 7), 374(11 to 1), 377(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(256: 60.000000), (257: 50.000000), (275: 120.000000), (276: 90.000000), (317: 0.000000), (374: 20.000000), (377: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(256: 6), (257: 4), (275: 4), (276: 3), (277: 1), (317: 6), (374: 3), (377: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
