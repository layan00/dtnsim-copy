The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1700(7 to 5), 1706(12 to 5), 1725(8 to 4), 1728(8 to 3), 1729(10 to 7), 1765(3 to 7), 1822(11 to 1), 1827(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1700: 20.000000), (1706: 10.000000), (1728: 130.000000), (1765: 0.000000), (1822: 20.000000), (1827: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1700: 6), (1706: 3), (1725: 2), (1728: 6), (1729: 1), (1765: 6), (1822: 3), (1827: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
