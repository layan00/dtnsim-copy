The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
261(7 to 5), 267(12 to 5), 287(8 to 4), 290(8 to 3), 291(10 to 7), 328(3 to 7), 385(11 to 1), 390(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 20.000000), (267: 10.000000), (290: 70.000000), (328: 0.000000), (385: 20.000000), (390: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(261: 6), (267: 3), (287: 2), (290: 5), (291: 1), (328: 6), (385: 3), (390: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
