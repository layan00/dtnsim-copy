The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
990(7 to 5), 991(12 to 5), 999(8 to 4), 1001(8 to 3), 1002(10 to 7), 1027(3 to 7), 1053(11 to 1), 1056(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(991: 10.000000), (1001: 130.000000), (1002: 10.000000), (1053: 20.000000), (1056: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(990: 5), (991: 3), (999: 3), (1001: 7), (1002: 3), (1027: 1), (1053: 3), (1056: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
