The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1018(7 to 5), 1024(12 to 5), 1032(8 to 4), 1035(8 to 3), 1036(10 to 7), 1057(3 to 7), 1084(11 to 1), 1087(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1018: 20.000000), (1024: 10.000000), (1032: 120.000000), (1035: 90.000000), (1036: 10.000000), (1084: 20.000000), (1087: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1018: 6), (1024: 3), (1032: 4), (1035: 3), (1036: 3), (1057: 4), (1084: 3), (1087: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
