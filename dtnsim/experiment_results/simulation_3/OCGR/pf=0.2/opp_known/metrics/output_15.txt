The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
254(7 to 5), 257(12 to 5), 267(8 to 4), 270(8 to 3), 271(10 to 7), 295(3 to 7), 325(11 to 1), 330(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(254: 60.000000), (257: 10.000000), (270: 70.000000), (271: 10.000000), (325: 20.000000), (330: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(254: 6), (257: 3), (267: 2), (270: 5), (271: 3), (295: 4), (325: 3), (330: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
