The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
646(7 to 5), 648(12 to 5), 657(8 to 4), 660(8 to 3), 661(10 to 7), 692(3 to 7), 723(11 to 1), 728(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(648: 10.000000), (660: 70.000000), (661: 10.000000), (692: 0.000000), (723: 20.000000), (728: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(646: 6), (648: 3), (657: 2), (660: 5), (661: 6), (692: 6), (723: 3), (728: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
