The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1788(7 to 5), 1789(12 to 5), 1799(8 to 4), 1801(8 to 3), 1802(10 to 7), 1834(3 to 7), 1867(11 to 1), 1872(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1788: 60.000000), (1789: 10.000000), (1799: 120.000000), (1801: 70.000000), (1802: 10.000000), (1834: 0.000000), (1872: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1788: 6), (1789: 3), (1799: 3), (1801: 5), (1802: 3), (1834: 6), (1867: 3), (1872: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
