The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1028(7 to 5), 1029(12 to 5), 1036(8 to 4), 1038(8 to 3), 1039(10 to 7), 1068(3 to 7), 1095(11 to 1), 1100(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1028: 60.000000), (1029: 10.000000), (1036: 120.000000), (1038: 70.000000), (1095: 20.000000), (1100: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1028: 6), (1029: 3), (1036: 3), (1038: 5), (1039: 4), (1068: 4), (1095: 3), (1100: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
