The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
627(7 to 5), 633(12 to 5), 641(8 to 4), 644(8 to 3), 645(10 to 7), 670(3 to 7), 693(11 to 1), 698(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(627: 20.000000), (633: 10.000000), (644: 70.000000), (645: 10.000000), (693: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(627: 6), (633: 3), (641: 3), (644: 5), (645: 3), (670: 1), (693: 3), (698: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
