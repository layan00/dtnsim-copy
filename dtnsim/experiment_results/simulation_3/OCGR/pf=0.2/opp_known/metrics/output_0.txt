The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
261(7 to 5), 267(12 to 5), 277(8 to 4), 280(8 to 3), 281(10 to 7), 306(3 to 7), 333(11 to 1), 336(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 20.000000), (267: 10.000000), (277: 120.000000), (280: 90.000000), (281: 10.000000), (333: 20.000000), (336: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(261: 6), (267: 3), (277: 3), (280: 3), (281: 3), (306: 4), (333: 3), (336: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
