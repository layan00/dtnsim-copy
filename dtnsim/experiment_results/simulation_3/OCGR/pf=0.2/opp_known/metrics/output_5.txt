The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
256(7 to 5), 262(12 to 5), 269(8 to 4), 272(8 to 3), 273(10 to 7), 302(3 to 7), 331(11 to 1), 334(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(256: 20.000000), (262: 10.000000), (269: 120.000000), (272: 90.000000), (273: 10.000000), (302: 0.000000), (334: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(256: 6), (262: 3), (269: 3), (272: 3), (273: 6), (302: 6), (331: 3), (334: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
