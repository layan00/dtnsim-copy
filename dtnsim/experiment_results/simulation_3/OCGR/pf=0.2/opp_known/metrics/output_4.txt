The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1772(7 to 5), 1778(12 to 5), 1787(8 to 4), 1790(8 to 3), 1791(10 to 7), 1814(3 to 7), 1836(11 to 1), 1841(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1772: 20.000000), (1778: 10.000000), (1787: 120.000000), (1790: 70.000000), (1791: 10.000000), (1836: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1772: 6), (1778: 3), (1787: 3), (1790: 5), (1791: 3), (1814: 1), (1836: 3), (1841: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
