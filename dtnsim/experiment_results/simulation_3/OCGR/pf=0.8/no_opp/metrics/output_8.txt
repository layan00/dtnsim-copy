The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
407(7 to 5), 408(12 to 5), 410(8 to 4), 411(8 to 3), 412(10 to 7), 418(3 to 7), 422(11 to 1), 424(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(407: 1), (408: 2), (410: 2), (411: 2), (412: 3), (418: 2), (422: 2), (424: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
