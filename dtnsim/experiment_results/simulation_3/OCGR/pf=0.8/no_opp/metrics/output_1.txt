The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(7 to 5), 203(12 to 5), 207(8 to 4), 209(8 to 3), 210(10 to 7), 215(3 to 7), 220(11 to 1), 221(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 2), (203: 3), (207: 2), (209: 2), (210: 2), (215: 1), (220: 1), (221: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 201: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
