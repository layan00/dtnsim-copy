The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
306(7 to 5), 307(12 to 5), 309(8 to 4), 310(8 to 3), 311(10 to 7), 313(3 to 7), 318(11 to 1), 320(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(306: 1), (307: 2), (309: 2), (310: 2), (311: 2), (313: 1), (318: 2), (320: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
