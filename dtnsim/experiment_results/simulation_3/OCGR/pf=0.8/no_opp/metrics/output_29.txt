The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
501(7 to 5), 502(12 to 5), 505(8 to 4), 506(8 to 3), 507(10 to 7), 512(3 to 7), 516(11 to 1), 518(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(506: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(501: 1), (502: 2), (505: 3), (506: 2), (507: 3), (512: 1), (516: 2), (518: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
