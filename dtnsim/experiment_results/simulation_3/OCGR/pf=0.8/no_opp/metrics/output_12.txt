The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
278(7 to 5), 279(12 to 5), 281(8 to 4), 282(8 to 3), 283(10 to 7), 287(3 to 7), 293(11 to 1), 294(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(278: 1), (279: 3), (281: 2), (282: 2), (283: 2), (287: 1), (293: 1), (294: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
