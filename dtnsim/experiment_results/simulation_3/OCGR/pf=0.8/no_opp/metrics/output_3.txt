The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
398(7 to 5), 400(12 to 5), 402(8 to 4), 403(8 to 3), 404(10 to 7), 405(3 to 7), 409(11 to 1), 411(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(398: 2), (400: 2), (402: 2), (403: 2), (404: 2), (405: 1), (409: 2), (411: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
