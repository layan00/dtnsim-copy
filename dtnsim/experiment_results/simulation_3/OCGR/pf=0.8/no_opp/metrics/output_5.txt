The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
85(7 to 5), 86(12 to 5), 89(8 to 4), 90(8 to 3), 91(10 to 7), 97(3 to 7), 104(11 to 1), 108(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(104: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(85: 1), (86: 2), (89: 2), (90: 2), (91: 4), (97: 3), (104: 3), (108: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
