The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
512(7 to 5), 513(12 to 5), 516(8 to 4), 517(8 to 3), 518(10 to 7), 521(3 to 7), 525(11 to 1), 527(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(512: 1), (513: 2), (516: 3), (517: 3), (518: 2), (521: 1), (525: 2), (527: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
