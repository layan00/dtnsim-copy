The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
86(7 to 5), 89(12 to 5), 94(8 to 4), 96(8 to 3), 97(10 to 7), 99(3 to 7), 106(11 to 1), 107(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(86: 4), (89: 2), (94: 2), (96: 2), (97: 4), (99: 1), (106: 1), (107: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 86: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
