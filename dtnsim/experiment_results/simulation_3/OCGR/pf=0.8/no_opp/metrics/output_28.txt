The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
390(7 to 5), 391(12 to 5), 394(8 to 4), 395(8 to 3), 396(10 to 7), 402(3 to 7), 408(11 to 1), 409(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(390: 1), (391: 2), (394: 2), (395: 2), (396: 2), (402: 1), (408: 1), (409: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
