The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
302(7 to 5), 303(12 to 5), 304(8 to 4), 305(8 to 3), 306(10 to 7), 308(3 to 7), 311(11 to 1), 312(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(305: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(302: 1), (303: 2), (304: 4), (305: 3), (306: 2), (308: 1), (311: 1), (312: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 312: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 304: (to: 3, time: 120.000000),

Node 3: 
Bundle 304: (to: 4, time: 140.000000), 
Bundle 308: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 312: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7:
