The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
486(7 to 5), 487(12 to 5), 491(8 to 4), 492(8 to 3), 493(10 to 7), 495(3 to 7), 497(11 to 1), 499(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(486: 1), (487: 2), (491: 3), (492: 3), (493: 2), (495: 1), (497: 2), (499: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
