The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
418(7 to 5), 419(12 to 5), 422(8 to 4), 423(8 to 3), 424(10 to 7), 430(3 to 7), 436(11 to 1), 437(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(418: 1), (419: 2), (422: 2), (423: 2), (424: 3), (430: 2), (436: 1), (437: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
