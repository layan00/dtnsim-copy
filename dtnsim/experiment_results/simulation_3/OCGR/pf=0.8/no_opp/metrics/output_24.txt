The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(7 to 5), 528(12 to 5), 532(8 to 4), 533(8 to 3), 534(10 to 7), 539(3 to 7), 544(11 to 1), 545(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 1), (528: 2), (532: 2), (533: 2), (534: 2), (539: 1), (544: 1), (545: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
