The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
308(7 to 5), 309(12 to 5), 311(8 to 4), 312(8 to 3), 313(10 to 7), 317(3 to 7), 320(11 to 1), 321(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(308: 1), (309: 2), (311: 3), (312: 3), (313: 2), (317: 1), (320: 1), (321: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
