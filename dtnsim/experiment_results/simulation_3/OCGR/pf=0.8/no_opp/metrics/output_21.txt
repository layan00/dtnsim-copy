The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(7 to 5), 205(12 to 5), 207(8 to 4), 208(8 to 3), 209(10 to 7), 214(3 to 7), 219(11 to 1), 220(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 2), (205: 2), (207: 2), (208: 2), (209: 2), (214: 1), (219: 1), (220: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
