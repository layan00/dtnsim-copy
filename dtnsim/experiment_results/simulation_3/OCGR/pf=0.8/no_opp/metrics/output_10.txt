The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
78(7 to 5), 79(12 to 5), 80(8 to 4), 81(8 to 3), 82(10 to 7), 84(3 to 7), 86(11 to 1), 87(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 1), (79: 2), (80: 2), (81: 2), (82: 2), (84: 1), (86: 1), (87: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
