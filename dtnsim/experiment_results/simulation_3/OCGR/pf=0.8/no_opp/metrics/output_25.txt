The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
76(7 to 5), 77(12 to 5), 78(8 to 4), 79(8 to 3), 80(10 to 7), 87(3 to 7), 89(11 to 1), 90(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(76: 1), (77: 3), (78: 2), (79: 2), (80: 2), (87: 1), (89: 1), (90: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
