The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
381(7 to 5), 382(12 to 5), 384(8 to 4), 385(8 to 3), 386(10 to 7), 388(3 to 7), 394(11 to 1), 396(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(396: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(381: 1), (382: 2), (384: 2), (385: 2), (386: 2), (388: 1), (394: 3), (396: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
