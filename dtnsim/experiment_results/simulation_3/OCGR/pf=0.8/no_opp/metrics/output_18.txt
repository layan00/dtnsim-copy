The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
376(7 to 5), 377(12 to 5), 381(8 to 4), 382(8 to 3), 383(10 to 7), 388(3 to 7), 391(11 to 1), 392(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(376: 1), (377: 2), (381: 2), (382: 2), (383: 2), (388: 1), (391: 1), (392: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
