The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1008(7 to 5), 1009(12 to 5), 1023(8 to 4), 1025(8 to 3), 1026(10 to 7), 1055(3 to 7), 1097(11 to 1), 1100(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1009: 10.000000), (1097: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1008: 4), (1009: 3), (1023: 2), (1025: 2), (1026: 2), (1055: 1), (1097: 3), (1100: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
