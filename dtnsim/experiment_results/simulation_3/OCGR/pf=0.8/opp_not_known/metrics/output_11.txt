The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
607(7 to 5), 608(12 to 5), 621(8 to 4), 622(8 to 3), 623(10 to 7), 650(3 to 7), 693(11 to 1), 696(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(608: 50.000000), (693: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(607: 4), (608: 4), (621: 2), (622: 2), (623: 3), (650: 1), (693: 3), (696: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
