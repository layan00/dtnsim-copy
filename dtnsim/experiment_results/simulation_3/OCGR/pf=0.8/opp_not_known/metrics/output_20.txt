The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(7 to 5), 227(12 to 5), 241(8 to 4), 242(8 to 3), 243(10 to 7), 274(3 to 7), 316(11 to 1), 321(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(321: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 2), (227: 4), (241: 2), (242: 2), (243: 4), (274: 3), (316: 3), (321: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
