The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1819(7 to 5), 1820(12 to 5), 1835(8 to 4), 1836(8 to 3), 1837(10 to 7), 1868(3 to 7), 1909(11 to 1), 1912(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1820: 50.000000), (1836: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1819: 4), (1820: 4), (1835: 3), (1836: 2), (1837: 3), (1868: 1), (1909: 3), (1912: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
