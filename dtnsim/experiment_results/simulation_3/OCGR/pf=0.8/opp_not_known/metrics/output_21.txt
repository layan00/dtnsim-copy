The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
633(7 to 5), 635(12 to 5), 649(8 to 4), 650(8 to 3), 651(10 to 7), 680(3 to 7), 722(11 to 1), 725(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(635: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(633: 2), (635: 4), (649: 2), (650: 2), (651: 1), (680: 1), (722: 3), (725: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
