The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1408(7 to 5), 1409(12 to 5), 1423(8 to 4), 1424(8 to 3), 1425(10 to 7), 1453(3 to 7), 1495(11 to 1), 1498(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1498: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1408: 4), (1409: 4), (1423: 2), (1424: 2), (1425: 2), (1453: 1), (1495: 3), (1498: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
