The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1412(7 to 5), 1413(12 to 5), 1428(8 to 4), 1429(8 to 3), 1430(10 to 7), 1462(3 to 7), 1504(11 to 1), 1507(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1412: 4), (1413: 4), (1428: 2), (1429: 2), (1430: 2), (1462: 1), (1504: 3), (1507: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
