The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
628(7 to 5), 631(12 to 5), 646(8 to 4), 648(8 to 3), 649(10 to 7), 679(3 to 7), 719(11 to 1), 722(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(628: 4), (631: 4), (646: 2), (648: 2), (649: 2), (679: 1), (719: 3), (722: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
