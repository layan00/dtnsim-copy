The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1033(7 to 5), 1034(12 to 5), 1047(8 to 4), 1048(8 to 3), 1049(10 to 7), 1080(3 to 7), 1119(11 to 1), 1122(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1033: 5), (1034: 4), (1047: 3), (1048: 3), (1049: 2), (1080: 1), (1119: 3), (1122: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
