The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1819(7 to 5), 1822(12 to 5), 1837(8 to 4), 1840(8 to 3), 1841(10 to 7), 1871(3 to 7), 1911(11 to 1), 1914(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1822: 10.000000), (1840: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1819: 4), (1822: 3), (1837: 3), (1840: 2), (1841: 2), (1871: 1), (1911: 3), (1914: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
