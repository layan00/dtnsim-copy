The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
618(7 to 5), 619(12 to 5), 632(8 to 4), 633(8 to 3), 634(10 to 7), 663(3 to 7), 701(11 to 1), 704(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(618: 4), (619: 4), (632: 2), (633: 2), (634: 2), (663: 1), (701: 3), (704: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
