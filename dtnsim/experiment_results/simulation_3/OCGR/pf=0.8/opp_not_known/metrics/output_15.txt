The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(7 to 5), 224(12 to 5), 241(8 to 4), 243(8 to 3), 244(10 to 7), 272(3 to 7), 316(11 to 1), 319(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 5), (224: 4), (241: 2), (243: 2), (244: 4), (272: 1), (316: 3), (319: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
