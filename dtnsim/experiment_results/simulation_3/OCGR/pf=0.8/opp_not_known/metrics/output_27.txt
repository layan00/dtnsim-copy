The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1001(7 to 5), 1002(12 to 5), 1017(8 to 4), 1019(8 to 3), 1020(10 to 7), 1049(3 to 7), 1094(11 to 1), 1098(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1002: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1001: 4), (1002: 3), (1017: 3), (1019: 3), (1020: 3), (1049: 3), (1094: 3), (1098: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
