The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
603(7 to 5), 604(12 to 5), 619(8 to 4), 620(8 to 3), 621(10 to 7), 652(3 to 7), 691(11 to 1), 694(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(603: 5), (604: 4), (619: 2), (620: 2), (621: 2), (652: 1), (691: 3), (694: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
