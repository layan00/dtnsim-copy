The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
637(7 to 5), 639(12 to 5), 654(8 to 4), 655(8 to 3), 656(10 to 7), 685(3 to 7), 726(11 to 1), 729(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(637: 2), (639: 4), (654: 2), (655: 2), (656: 1), (685: 1), (726: 3), (729: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
