The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1027(7 to 5), 1028(12 to 5), 1042(8 to 4), 1043(8 to 3), 1044(10 to 7), 1072(3 to 7), 1113(11 to 1), 1116(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1027: 4), (1028: 4), (1042: 2), (1043: 2), (1044: 2), (1072: 1), (1113: 3), (1116: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
