The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(7 to 5), 222(12 to 5), 236(8 to 4), 237(8 to 3), 238(10 to 7), 270(3 to 7), 313(11 to 1), 318(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 4), (222: 4), (236: 2), (237: 2), (238: 4), (270: 3), (313: 3), (318: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
