The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1030(7 to 5), 1031(12 to 5), 1044(8 to 4), 1045(8 to 3), 1046(10 to 7), 1074(3 to 7), 1113(11 to 1), 1116(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1045: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1030: 4), (1031: 4), (1044: 4), (1045: 3), (1046: 2), (1074: 1), (1113: 3), (1116: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
