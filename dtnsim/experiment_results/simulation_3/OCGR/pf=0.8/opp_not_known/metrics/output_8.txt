The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1423(7 to 5), 1424(12 to 5), 1437(8 to 4), 1438(8 to 3), 1439(10 to 7), 1471(3 to 7), 1510(11 to 1), 1513(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1423: 5), (1424: 4), (1437: 2), (1438: 2), (1439: 1), (1471: 1), (1510: 3), (1513: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
