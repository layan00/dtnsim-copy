The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(7 to 5), 213(12 to 5), 226(8 to 4), 227(8 to 3), 228(10 to 7), 260(3 to 7), 298(11 to 1), 301(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 4), (213: 4), (226: 3), (227: 3), (228: 2), (260: 1), (298: 3), (301: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
