The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(7 to 5), 211(12 to 5), 214(8 to 4), 215(8 to 3), 216(10 to 7), 234(3 to 7), 248(11 to 1), 251(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 4), (211: 4), (214: 2), (215: 2), (216: 4), (234: 1), (248: 3), (251: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
