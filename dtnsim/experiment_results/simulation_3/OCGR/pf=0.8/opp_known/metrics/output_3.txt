The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1097(7 to 5), 1099(12 to 5), 1103(8 to 4), 1104(8 to 3), 1105(10 to 7), 1120(3 to 7), 1136(11 to 1), 1139(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1097: 3), (1099: 4), (1103: 2), (1104: 2), (1105: 4), (1120: 1), (1136: 3), (1139: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
