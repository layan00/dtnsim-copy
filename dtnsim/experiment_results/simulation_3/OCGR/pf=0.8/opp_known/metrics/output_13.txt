The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1082(7 to 5), 1083(12 to 5), 1087(8 to 4), 1088(8 to 3), 1089(10 to 7), 1107(3 to 7), 1125(11 to 1), 1128(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1128: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1082: 4), (1083: 4), (1087: 2), (1088: 2), (1089: 4), (1107: 1), (1125: 3), (1128: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
