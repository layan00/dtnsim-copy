The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1112(7 to 5), 1113(12 to 5), 1117(8 to 4), 1118(8 to 3), 1119(10 to 7), 1139(3 to 7), 1156(11 to 1), 1159(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1112: 4), (1113: 4), (1117: 2), (1118: 2), (1119: 4), (1139: 1), (1156: 3), (1159: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
