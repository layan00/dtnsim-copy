The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
511(7 to 5), 514(12 to 5), 519(8 to 4), 521(8 to 3), 522(10 to 7), 545(3 to 7), 561(11 to 1), 564(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(522: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(511: 5), (514: 4), (519: 2), (521: 4), (522: 6), (545: 1), (561: 3), (564: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
