The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
495(7 to 5), 496(12 to 5), 499(8 to 4), 500(8 to 3), 501(10 to 7), 518(3 to 7), 536(11 to 1), 539(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 50.000000), (536: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(495: 4), (496: 4), (499: 2), (500: 2), (501: 4), (518: 1), (536: 3), (539: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
