The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1382(7 to 5), 1383(12 to 5), 1388(8 to 4), 1389(8 to 3), 1390(10 to 7), 1409(3 to 7), 1425(11 to 1), 1428(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1382: 4), (1383: 4), (1388: 3), (1389: 7), (1390: 4), (1409: 1), (1425: 3), (1428: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
