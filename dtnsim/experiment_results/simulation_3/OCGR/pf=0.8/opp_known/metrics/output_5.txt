The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(7 to 5), 218(12 to 5), 222(8 to 4), 223(8 to 3), 224(10 to 7), 244(3 to 7), 262(11 to 1), 265(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 4), (218: 4), (222: 2), (223: 2), (224: 4), (244: 1), (262: 3), (265: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
