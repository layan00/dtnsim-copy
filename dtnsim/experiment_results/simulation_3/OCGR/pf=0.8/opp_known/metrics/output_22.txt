The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
810(7 to 5), 811(12 to 5), 814(8 to 4), 815(8 to 3), 816(10 to 7), 837(3 to 7), 852(11 to 1), 855(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(815: 130.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(810: 5), (811: 4), (814: 3), (815: 7), (816: 4), (837: 1), (852: 3), (855: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
