The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
494(7 to 5), 495(12 to 5), 500(8 to 4), 501(8 to 3), 502(10 to 7), 526(3 to 7), 541(11 to 1), 544(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(502: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(494: 5), (495: 4), (500: 2), (501: 2), (502: 6), (526: 1), (541: 3), (544: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
