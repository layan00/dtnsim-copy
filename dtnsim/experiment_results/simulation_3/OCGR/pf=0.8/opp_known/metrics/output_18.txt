The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1069(7 to 5), 1070(12 to 5), 1075(8 to 4), 1076(8 to 3), 1077(10 to 7), 1099(3 to 7), 1117(11 to 1), 1120(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1069: 6), (1070: 4), (1075: 2), (1076: 2), (1077: 4), (1099: 4), (1117: 3), (1120: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
