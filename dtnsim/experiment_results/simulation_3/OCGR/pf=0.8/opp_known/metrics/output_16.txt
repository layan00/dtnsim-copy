The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
504(7 to 5), 505(12 to 5), 508(8 to 4), 509(8 to 3), 510(10 to 7), 528(3 to 7), 542(11 to 1), 545(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(504: 4), (505: 4), (508: 2), (509: 2), (510: 4), (528: 1), (542: 3), (545: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
