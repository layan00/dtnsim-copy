The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1359(7 to 5), 1360(12 to 5), 1363(8 to 4), 1364(8 to 3), 1365(10 to 7), 1384(3 to 7), 1402(11 to 1), 1405(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1402: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1359: 4), (1360: 4), (1363: 2), (1364: 2), (1365: 4), (1384: 4), (1402: 3), (1405: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
