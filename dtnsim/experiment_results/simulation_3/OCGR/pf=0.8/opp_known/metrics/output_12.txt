The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
787(7 to 5), 788(12 to 5), 792(8 to 4), 794(8 to 3), 795(10 to 7), 817(3 to 7), 835(11 to 1), 838(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(788: 10.000000), (795: 10.000000), (835: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(787: 4), (788: 3), (792: 2), (794: 2), (795: 6), (817: 1), (835: 3), (838: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
