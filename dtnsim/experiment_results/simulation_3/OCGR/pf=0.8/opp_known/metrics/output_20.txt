The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(7 to 5), 223(12 to 5), 227(8 to 4), 228(8 to 3), 229(10 to 7), 248(3 to 7), 265(11 to 1), 268(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(268: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 3), (223: 4), (227: 2), (228: 2), (229: 4), (248: 1), (265: 3), (268: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
