The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1389(7 to 5), 1390(12 to 5), 1395(8 to 4), 1396(8 to 3), 1397(10 to 7), 1418(3 to 7), 1437(11 to 1), 1440(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1390: 50.000000), (1396: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1389: 4), (1390: 4), (1395: 3), (1396: 3), (1397: 4), (1418: 4), (1437: 3), (1440: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
