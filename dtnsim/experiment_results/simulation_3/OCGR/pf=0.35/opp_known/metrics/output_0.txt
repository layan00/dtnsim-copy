The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
258(7 to 5), 264(12 to 5), 274(8 to 4), 277(8 to 3), 278(10 to 7), 302(3 to 7), 328(11 to 1), 331(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(258: 20.000000), (264: 10.000000), (274: 120.000000), (277: 90.000000), (278: 10.000000), (328: 20.000000), (331: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(258: 6), (264: 3), (274: 3), (277: 3), (278: 3), (302: 4), (328: 3), (331: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
