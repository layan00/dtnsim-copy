The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
967(7 to 5), 968(12 to 5), 974(8 to 4), 975(8 to 3), 976(10 to 7), 1002(3 to 7), 1026(11 to 1), 1029(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(974: 120.000000), (975: 90.000000), (1029: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(967: 6), (968: 4), (974: 4), (975: 3), (976: 4), (1002: 4), (1026: 3), (1029: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
