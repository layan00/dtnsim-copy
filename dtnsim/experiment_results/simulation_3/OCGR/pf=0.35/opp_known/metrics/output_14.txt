The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1669(7 to 5), 1670(12 to 5), 1677(8 to 4), 1679(8 to 3), 1680(10 to 7), 1707(3 to 7), 1728(11 to 1), 1733(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1670: 10.000000), (1680: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1669: 5), (1670: 3), (1677: 3), (1679: 5), (1680: 3), (1707: 1), (1728: 3), (1733: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
