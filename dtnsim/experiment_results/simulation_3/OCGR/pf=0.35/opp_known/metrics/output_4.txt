The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1678(7 to 5), 1684(12 to 5), 1693(8 to 4), 1696(8 to 3), 1697(10 to 7), 1720(3 to 7), 1740(11 to 1), 1745(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1678: 20.000000), (1684: 10.000000), (1693: 120.000000), (1696: 70.000000), (1697: 10.000000), (1740: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1678: 6), (1684: 3), (1693: 3), (1696: 5), (1697: 3), (1720: 1), (1740: 3), (1745: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
