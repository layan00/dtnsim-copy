The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
623(7 to 5), 626(12 to 5), 633(8 to 4), 635(8 to 3), 636(10 to 7), 659(3 to 7), 682(11 to 1), 685(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(626: 50.000000), (635: 130.000000), (636: 10.000000), (682: 20.000000), (685: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(623: 5), (626: 4), (633: 3), (635: 7), (636: 3), (659: 1), (682: 3), (685: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
