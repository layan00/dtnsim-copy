The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
585(7 to 5), 587(12 to 5), 594(8 to 4), 596(8 to 3), 597(10 to 7), 620(3 to 7), 640(11 to 1), 645(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(587: 10.000000), (596: 70.000000), (597: 10.000000), (640: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(585: 3), (587: 3), (594: 2), (596: 5), (597: 3), (620: 1), (640: 3), (645: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
