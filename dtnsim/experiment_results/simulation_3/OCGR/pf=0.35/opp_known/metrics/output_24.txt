The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1692(7 to 5), 1693(12 to 5), 1700(8 to 4), 1702(8 to 3), 1703(10 to 7), 1734(3 to 7), 1758(11 to 1), 1763(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1693: 10.000000), (1702: 70.000000), (1703: 10.000000), (1758: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1692: 5), (1693: 3), (1700: 2), (1702: 5), (1703: 6), (1734: 1), (1758: 3), (1763: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
