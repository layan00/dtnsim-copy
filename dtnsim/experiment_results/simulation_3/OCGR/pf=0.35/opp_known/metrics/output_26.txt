The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
614(7 to 5), 616(12 to 5), 624(8 to 4), 626(8 to 3), 627(10 to 7), 657(3 to 7), 686(11 to 1), 691(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(616: 50.000000), (624: 120.000000), (627: 10.000000), (657: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(614: 6), (616: 4), (624: 3), (626: 5), (627: 6), (657: 6), (686: 3), (691: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
