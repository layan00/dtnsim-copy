The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
600(7 to 5), 606(12 to 5), 615(8 to 4), 618(8 to 3), 619(10 to 7), 644(3 to 7), 675(11 to 1), 678(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(600: 20.000000), (606: 10.000000), (619: 10.000000), (644: 0.000000), (675: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(600: 6), (606: 3), (615: 2), (618: 4), (619: 3), (644: 6), (675: 3), (678: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
