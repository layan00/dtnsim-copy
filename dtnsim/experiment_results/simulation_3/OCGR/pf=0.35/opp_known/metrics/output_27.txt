The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
972(7 to 5), 973(12 to 5), 983(8 to 4), 985(8 to 3), 986(10 to 7), 1010(3 to 7), 1032(11 to 1), 1035(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(973: 10.000000), (983: 120.000000), (985: 90.000000), (986: 10.000000), (1035: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(972: 5), (973: 3), (983: 4), (985: 3), (986: 3), (1010: 1), (1032: 3), (1035: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
