The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1691(7 to 5), 1692(12 to 5), 1701(8 to 4), 1703(8 to 3), 1704(10 to 7), 1731(3 to 7), 1755(11 to 1), 1758(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1691: 60.000000), (1692: 10.000000), (1701: 120.000000), (1703: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1691: 6), (1692: 3), (1701: 3), (1703: 3), (1704: 4), (1731: 4), (1755: 3), (1758: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
