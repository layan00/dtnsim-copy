The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
962(7 to 5), 964(12 to 5), 971(8 to 4), 974(8 to 3), 975(10 to 7), 996(3 to 7), 1015(11 to 1), 1018(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(964: 10.000000), (971: 120.000000), (974: 90.000000), (975: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(962: 6), (964: 3), (971: 4), (974: 3), (975: 3), (996: 1), (1015: 3), (1018: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
