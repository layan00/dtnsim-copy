The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
774(7 to 5), 775(12 to 5), 781(8 to 4), 782(8 to 3), 783(10 to 7), 799(3 to 7), 809(11 to 1), 817(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(783: 50.000000), (799: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(774: 1), (775: 4), (781: 2), (782: 2), (783: 5), (799: 4), (809: 2), (817: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
