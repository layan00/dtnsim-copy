The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
117(7 to 5), 120(12 to 5), 129(8 to 4), 132(8 to 3), 133(10 to 7), 144(3 to 7), 158(11 to 1), 161(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(117: 60.000000), (120: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(117: 5), (120: 4), (129: 2), (132: 2), (133: 3), (144: 4), (158: 1), (161: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
