The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
629(7 to 5), 632(12 to 5), 638(8 to 4), 639(8 to 3), 640(10 to 7), 651(3 to 7), 663(11 to 1), 665(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(663: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(629: 3), (632: 2), (638: 2), (639: 2), (640: 3), (651: 2), (663: 3), (665: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
