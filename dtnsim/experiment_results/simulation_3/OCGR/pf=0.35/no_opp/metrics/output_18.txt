The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
578(7 to 5), 579(12 to 5), 587(8 to 4), 588(8 to 3), 589(10 to 7), 602(3 to 7), 613(11 to 1), 617(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(578: 1), (579: 2), (587: 2), (588: 2), (589: 4), (602: 3), (613: 2), (617: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
