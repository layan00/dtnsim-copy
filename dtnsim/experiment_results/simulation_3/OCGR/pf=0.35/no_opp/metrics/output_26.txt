The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
289(7 to 5), 291(12 to 5), 298(8 to 4), 300(8 to 3), 301(10 to 7), 315(3 to 7), 326(11 to 1), 327(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(291: 50.000000), (298: 120.000000), (300: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(289: 2), (291: 4), (298: 3), (300: 2), (301: 3), (315: 2), (326: 1), (327: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
