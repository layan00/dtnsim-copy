The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
433(7 to 5), 434(12 to 5), 438(8 to 4), 439(8 to 3), 440(10 to 7), 451(3 to 7), 464(11 to 1), 468(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(464: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(433: 1), (434: 4), (438: 3), (439: 3), (440: 4), (451: 3), (464: 3), (468: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
