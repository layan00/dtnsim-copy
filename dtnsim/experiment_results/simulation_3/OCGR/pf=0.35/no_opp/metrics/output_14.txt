The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
768(7 to 5), 769(12 to 5), 774(8 to 4), 775(8 to 3), 776(10 to 7), 787(3 to 7), 796(11 to 1), 802(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(775: 90.000000), (802: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(768: 1), (769: 2), (774: 3), (775: 2), (776: 5), (787: 4), (796: 2), (802: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
