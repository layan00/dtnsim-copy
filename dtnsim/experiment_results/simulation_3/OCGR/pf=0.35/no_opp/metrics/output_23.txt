The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
632(7 to 5), 635(12 to 5), 639(8 to 4), 642(8 to 3), 643(10 to 7), 655(3 to 7), 666(11 to 1), 668(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(642: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(632: 5), (635: 4), (639: 4), (642: 3), (643: 3), (655: 2), (666: 2), (668: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
