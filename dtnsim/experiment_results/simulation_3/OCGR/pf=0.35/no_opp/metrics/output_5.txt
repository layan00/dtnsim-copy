The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
109(7 to 5), 110(12 to 5), 115(8 to 4), 116(8 to 3), 117(10 to 7), 130(3 to 7), 140(11 to 1), 144(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(115: 120.000000), (116: 90.000000), (140: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(109: 1), (110: 2), (115: 3), (116: 2), (117: 4), (130: 3), (140: 3), (144: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
