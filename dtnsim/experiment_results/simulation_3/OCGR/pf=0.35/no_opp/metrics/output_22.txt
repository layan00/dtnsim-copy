The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
452(7 to 5), 453(12 to 5), 458(8 to 4), 460(8 to 3), 461(10 to 7), 472(3 to 7), 482(11 to 1), 490(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(458: 120.000000), (460: 90.000000), (461: 50.000000), (472: 35.000000), (482: 80.000000), (490: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(452: 1), (453: 4), (458: 4), (460: 3), (461: 5), (472: 4), (482: 3), (490: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
