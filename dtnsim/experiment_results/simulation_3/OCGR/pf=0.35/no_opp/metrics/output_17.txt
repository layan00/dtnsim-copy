The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
415(7 to 5), 416(12 to 5), 422(8 to 4), 423(8 to 3), 424(10 to 7), 434(3 to 7), 445(11 to 1), 452(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(424: 50.000000), (434: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(415: 1), (416: 2), (422: 2), (423: 2), (424: 5), (434: 4), (445: 1), (452: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
