The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
791(7 to 5), 794(12 to 5), 801(8 to 4), 803(8 to 3), 804(10 to 7), 816(3 to 7), 824(11 to 1), 825(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(801: 120.000000), (803: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(791: 4), (794: 4), (801: 3), (803: 2), (804: 3), (816: 2), (824: 1), (825: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
