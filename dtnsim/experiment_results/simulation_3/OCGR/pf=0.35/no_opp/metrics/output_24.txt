The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
806(7 to 5), 807(12 to 5), 813(8 to 4), 814(8 to 3), 815(10 to 7), 826(3 to 7), 840(11 to 1), 842(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(806: 1), (807: 2), (813: 2), (814: 2), (815: 4), (826: 2), (840: 2), (842: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
