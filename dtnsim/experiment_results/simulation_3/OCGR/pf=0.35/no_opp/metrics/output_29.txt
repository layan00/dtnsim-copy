The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
797(7 to 5), 798(12 to 5), 806(8 to 4), 808(8 to 3), 809(10 to 7), 820(3 to 7), 829(11 to 1), 831(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(798: 50.000000), (806: 120.000000), (808: 90.000000), (829: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(797: 1), (798: 4), (806: 3), (808: 2), (809: 2), (820: 1), (829: 3), (831: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
