The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
601(7 to 5), 604(12 to 5), 609(8 to 4), 611(8 to 3), 612(10 to 7), 625(3 to 7), 640(11 to 1), 642(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(601: 60.000000), (609: 120.000000), (611: 90.000000), (642: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(601: 5), (604: 3), (609: 3), (611: 2), (612: 2), (625: 1), (640: 3), (642: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
