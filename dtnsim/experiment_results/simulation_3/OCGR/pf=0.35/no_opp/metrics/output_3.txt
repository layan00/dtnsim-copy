The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
626(7 to 5), 629(12 to 5), 634(8 to 4), 635(8 to 3), 636(10 to 7), 647(3 to 7), 657(11 to 1), 661(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(657: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(626: 3), (629: 4), (634: 2), (635: 2), (636: 2), (647: 4), (657: 3), (661: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
