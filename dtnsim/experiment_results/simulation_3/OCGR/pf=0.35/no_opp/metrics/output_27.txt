The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
453(7 to 5), 454(12 to 5), 462(8 to 4), 463(8 to 3), 464(10 to 7), 472(3 to 7), 483(11 to 1), 487(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(462: 120.000000), (463: 90.000000), (483: 80.000000), (487: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(453: 1), (454: 2), (462: 4), (463: 3), (464: 4), (472: 3), (483: 3), (487: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
