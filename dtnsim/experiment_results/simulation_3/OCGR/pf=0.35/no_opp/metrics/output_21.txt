The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
292(7 to 5), 294(12 to 5), 298(8 to 4), 299(8 to 3), 300(10 to 7), 315(3 to 7), 327(11 to 1), 329(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(294: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(292: 2), (294: 5), (298: 2), (299: 2), (300: 2), (315: 1), (327: 2), (329: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
