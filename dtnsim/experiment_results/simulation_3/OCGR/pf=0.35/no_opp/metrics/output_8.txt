The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
612(7 to 5), 615(12 to 5), 619(8 to 4), 620(8 to 3), 621(10 to 7), 631(3 to 7), 642(11 to 1), 644(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(642: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(612: 3), (615: 2), (619: 2), (620: 2), (621: 3), (631: 2), (642: 3), (644: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 612: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
