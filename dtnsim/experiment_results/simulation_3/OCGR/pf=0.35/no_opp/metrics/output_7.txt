The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
451(7 to 5), 453(12 to 5), 459(8 to 4), 460(8 to 3), 461(10 to 7), 465(3 to 7), 473(11 to 1), 475(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(459: 120.000000), (460: 90.000000), (473: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(451: 2), (453: 2), (459: 4), (460: 3), (461: 2), (465: 2), (473: 3), (475: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
