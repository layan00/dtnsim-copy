The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
468(7 to 5), 469(12 to 5), 474(8 to 4), 475(8 to 3), 476(10 to 7), 482(3 to 7), 492(11 to 1), 494(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(474: 120.000000), (475: 90.000000), (492: 80.000000), (494: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(468: 1), (469: 2), (474: 4), (475: 3), (476: 2), (482: 1), (492: 3), (494: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
