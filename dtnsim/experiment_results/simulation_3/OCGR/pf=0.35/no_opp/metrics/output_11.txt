The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
277(7 to 5), 279(12 to 5), 283(8 to 4), 284(8 to 3), 285(10 to 7), 289(3 to 7), 301(11 to 1), 303(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(301: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(277: 2), (279: 2), (283: 2), (284: 2), (285: 3), (289: 1), (301: 3), (303: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
