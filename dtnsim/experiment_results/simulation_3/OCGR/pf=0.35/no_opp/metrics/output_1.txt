The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
305(7 to 5), 308(12 to 5), 314(8 to 4), 317(8 to 3), 318(10 to 7), 328(3 to 7), 339(11 to 1), 347(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(318: 50.000000), (328: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(305: 4), (308: 3), (314: 3), (317: 3), (318: 5), (328: 4), (339: 2), (347: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
