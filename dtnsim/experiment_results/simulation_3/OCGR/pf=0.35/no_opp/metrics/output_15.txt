The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
109(7 to 5), 112(12 to 5), 119(8 to 4), 122(8 to 3), 123(10 to 7), 125(3 to 7), 138(11 to 1), 143(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(123: 50.000000), (138: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(109: 4), (112: 3), (119: 3), (122: 3), (123: 6), (125: 1), (138: 3), (143: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
