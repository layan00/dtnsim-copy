The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
279(7 to 5), 282(12 to 5), 289(8 to 4), 291(8 to 3), 292(10 to 7), 307(3 to 7), 322(11 to 1), 324(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(279: 60.000000), (282: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(279: 5), (282: 5), (289: 2), (291: 2), (292: 2), (307: 1), (322: 2), (324: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
