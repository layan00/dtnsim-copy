The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
742(7 to 5), 744(12 to 5), 750(8 to 4), 751(8 to 3), 752(10 to 7), 763(3 to 7), 777(11 to 1), 785(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(751: 90.000000), (752: 50.000000), (763: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(742: 2), (744: 2), (750: 3), (751: 2), (752: 5), (763: 4), (777: 2), (785: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
