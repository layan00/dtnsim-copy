The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
734(7 to 5), 737(12 to 5), 754(8 to 4), 756(8 to 3), 757(10 to 7), 790(3 to 7), 837(11 to 1), 840(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(737: 50.000000), (837: 20.000000), (840: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(734: 5), (737: 4), (754: 3), (756: 3), (757: 1), (790: 1), (837: 3), (840: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
