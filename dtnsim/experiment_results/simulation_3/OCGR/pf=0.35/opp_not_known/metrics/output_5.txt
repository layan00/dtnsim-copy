The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(7 to 5), 246(12 to 5), 262(8 to 4), 264(8 to 3), 265(10 to 7), 303(3 to 7), 354(11 to 1), 357(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 10.000000), (262: 120.000000), (264: 90.000000), (303: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 4), (246: 3), (262: 3), (264: 2), (265: 1), (303: 6), (354: 3), (357: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
