The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1634(7 to 5), 1637(12 to 5), 1652(8 to 4), 1654(8 to 3), 1655(10 to 7), 1688(3 to 7), 1737(11 to 1), 1740(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1637: 10.000000), (1737: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1634: 4), (1637: 3), (1652: 2), (1654: 2), (1655: 1), (1688: 4), (1737: 3), (1740: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
