The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
253(7 to 5), 259(12 to 5), 279(8 to 4), 282(8 to 3), 283(10 to 7), 316(3 to 7), 371(11 to 1), 376(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 20.000000), (259: 10.000000), (282: 70.000000), (316: 0.000000), (371: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 6), (259: 3), (279: 2), (282: 5), (283: 3), (316: 6), (371: 3), (376: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
