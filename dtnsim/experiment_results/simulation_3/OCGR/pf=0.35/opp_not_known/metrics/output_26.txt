The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
726(7 to 5), 728(12 to 5), 746(8 to 4), 748(8 to 3), 749(10 to 7), 787(3 to 7), 841(11 to 1), 846(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(728: 50.000000), (748: 130.000000), (787: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(726: 5), (728: 4), (746: 2), (748: 6), (749: 1), (787: 6), (841: 3), (846: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
