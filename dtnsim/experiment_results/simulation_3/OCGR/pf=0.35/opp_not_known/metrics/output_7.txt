The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1180(7 to 5), 1182(12 to 5), 1199(8 to 4), 1202(8 to 3), 1203(10 to 7), 1233(3 to 7), 1276(11 to 1), 1279(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1182: 10.000000), (1199: 120.000000), (1202: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1180: 5), (1182: 3), (1199: 4), (1202: 3), (1203: 2), (1233: 1), (1276: 3), (1279: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
