The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(7 to 5), 248(12 to 5), 266(8 to 4), 268(8 to 3), 269(10 to 7), 295(3 to 7), 345(11 to 1), 351(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 50.000000), (269: 50.000000), (345: 20.000000), (351: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 5), (248: 4), (266: 3), (268: 3), (269: 6), (295: 1), (345: 3), (351: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
