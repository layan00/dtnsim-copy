The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(7 to 5), 247(12 to 5), 264(8 to 4), 265(8 to 3), 266(10 to 7), 301(3 to 7), 359(11 to 1), 365(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 50.000000), (264: 120.000000), (265: 90.000000), (266: 50.000000), (301: 0.000000), (359: 20.000000), (365: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 4), (247: 4), (264: 4), (265: 3), (266: 6), (301: 6), (359: 3), (365: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
