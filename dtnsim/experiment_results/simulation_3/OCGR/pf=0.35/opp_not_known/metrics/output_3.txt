The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1646(7 to 5), 1652(12 to 5), 1669(8 to 4), 1670(8 to 3), 1671(10 to 7), 1704(3 to 7), 1751(11 to 1), 1756(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1670: 70.000000), (1751: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1646: 7), (1652: 4), (1669: 2), (1670: 5), (1671: 2), (1704: 1), (1751: 3), (1756: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
