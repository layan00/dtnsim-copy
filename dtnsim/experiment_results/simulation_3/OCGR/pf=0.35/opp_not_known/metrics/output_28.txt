The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1657(7 to 5), 1663(12 to 5), 1680(8 to 4), 1681(8 to 3), 1682(10 to 7), 1717(3 to 7), 1769(11 to 1), 1772(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1657: 60.000000), (1663: 50.000000), (1769: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1657: 7), (1663: 4), (1680: 2), (1681: 2), (1682: 3), (1717: 2), (1769: 3), (1772: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
