The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
697(7 to 5), 699(12 to 5), 716(8 to 4), 718(8 to 3), 719(10 to 7), 752(3 to 7), 795(11 to 1), 798(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(699: 10.000000), (795: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(697: 2), (699: 3), (716: 2), (718: 2), (719: 1), (752: 1), (795: 3), (798: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
