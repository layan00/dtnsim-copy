The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2106(7 to 5), 2112(12 to 5), 2131(8 to 4), 2134(8 to 3), 2135(10 to 7), 2168(3 to 7), 2211(11 to 1), 2214(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2106: 20.000000), (2112: 10.000000), (2131: 120.000000), (2134: 90.000000), (2211: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2106: 6), (2112: 3), (2131: 3), (2134: 2), (2135: 1), (2168: 1), (2211: 3), (2214: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
