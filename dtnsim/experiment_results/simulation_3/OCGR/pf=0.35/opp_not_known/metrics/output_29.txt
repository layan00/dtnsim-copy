The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2123(7 to 5), 2124(12 to 5), 2143(8 to 4), 2145(8 to 3), 2146(10 to 7), 2184(3 to 7), 2232(11 to 1), 2235(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2123: 60.000000), (2124: 10.000000), (2143: 120.000000), (2145: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2123: 6), (2124: 3), (2143: 4), (2145: 3), (2146: 1), (2184: 4), (2232: 3), (2235: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
