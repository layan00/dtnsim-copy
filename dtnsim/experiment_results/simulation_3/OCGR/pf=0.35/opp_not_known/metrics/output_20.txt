The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
255(7 to 5), 261(12 to 5), 278(8 to 4), 281(8 to 3), 282(10 to 7), 316(3 to 7), 370(11 to 1), 373(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(255: 20.000000), (261: 10.000000), (316: 0.000000), (373: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(255: 6), (261: 3), (278: 2), (281: 2), (282: 1), (316: 6), (370: 3), (373: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
