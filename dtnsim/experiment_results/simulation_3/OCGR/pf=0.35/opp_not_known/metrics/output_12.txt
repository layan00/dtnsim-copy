The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1170(7 to 5), 1171(12 to 5), 1187(8 to 4), 1189(8 to 3), 1190(10 to 7), 1225(3 to 7), 1273(11 to 1), 1276(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1171: 10.000000), (1273: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1170: 5), (1171: 3), (1187: 3), (1189: 3), (1190: 1), (1225: 1), (1273: 3), (1276: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
