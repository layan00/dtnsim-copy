The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
710(7 to 5), 716(12 to 5), 735(8 to 4), 738(8 to 3), 739(10 to 7), 774(3 to 7), 829(11 to 1), 832(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(710: 20.000000), (716: 10.000000), (774: 0.000000), (829: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(710: 6), (716: 3), (735: 2), (738: 2), (739: 1), (774: 6), (829: 3), (832: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
