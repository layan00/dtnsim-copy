The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1190(7 to 5), 1191(12 to 5), 1211(8 to 4), 1213(8 to 3), 1214(10 to 7), 1248(3 to 7), 1294(11 to 1), 1297(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1191: 10.000000), (1211: 120.000000), (1213: 90.000000), (1297: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1190: 5), (1191: 3), (1211: 4), (1213: 3), (1214: 1), (1248: 1), (1294: 3), (1297: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
