The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2089(7 to 5), 2090(12 to 5), 2108(8 to 4), 2110(8 to 3), 2111(10 to 7), 2151(3 to 7), 2196(11 to 1), 2199(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2090: 10.000000), (2199: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2089: 5), (2090: 3), (2108: 3), (2110: 3), (2111: 1), (2151: 1), (2196: 3), (2199: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
