The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2125(7 to 5), 2126(12 to 5), 2143(8 to 4), 2145(8 to 3), 2146(10 to 7), 2184(3 to 7), 2235(11 to 1), 2240(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2126: 10.000000), (2145: 70.000000), (2235: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2125: 5), (2126: 3), (2143: 2), (2145: 5), (2146: 4), (2184: 1), (2235: 3), (2240: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
