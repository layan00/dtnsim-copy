The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2096(7 to 5), 2097(12 to 5), 2114(8 to 4), 2116(8 to 3), 2117(10 to 7), 2154(3 to 7), 2198(11 to 1), 2201(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2097: 10.000000), (2116: 90.000000), (2201: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2096: 5), (2097: 3), (2114: 3), (2116: 2), (2117: 1), (2154: 1), (2198: 3), (2201: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
