The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(7 to 5), 666(12 to 5), 671(8 to 4), 672(8 to 3), 673(10 to 7), 683(3 to 7), 695(11 to 1), 698(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(672: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(664: 2), (666: 2), (671: 3), (672: 2), (673: 5), (683: 3), (695: 1), (698: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
