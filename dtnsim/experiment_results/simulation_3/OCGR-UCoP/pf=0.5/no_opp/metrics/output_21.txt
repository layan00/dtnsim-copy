The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
262(7 to 5), 264(12 to 5), 268(8 to 4), 269(8 to 3), 270(10 to 7), 277(3 to 7), 287(11 to 1), 289(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(262: 2), (264: 2), (268: 2), (269: 2), (270: 3), (277: 1), (287: 2), (289: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
