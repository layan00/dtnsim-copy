The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
234(7 to 5), 236(12 to 5), 240(8 to 4), 241(8 to 3), 242(10 to 7), 247(3 to 7), 255(11 to 1), 258(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(234: 2), (236: 2), (240: 3), (241: 3), (242: 5), (247: 3), (255: 1), (258: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
