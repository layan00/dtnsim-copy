The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
682(7 to 5), 683(12 to 5), 688(8 to 4), 689(8 to 3), 690(10 to 7), 699(3 to 7), 708(11 to 1), 710(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(682: 1), (683: 2), (688: 2), (689: 2), (690: 3), (699: 2), (708: 2), (710: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
