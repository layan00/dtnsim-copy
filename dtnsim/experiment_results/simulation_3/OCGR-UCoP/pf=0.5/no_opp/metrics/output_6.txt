The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(7 to 5), 249(12 to 5), 255(8 to 4), 257(8 to 3), 258(10 to 7), 267(3 to 7), 279(11 to 1), 281(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 4), (249: 3), (255: 2), (257: 2), (258: 4), (267: 1), (279: 2), (281: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
