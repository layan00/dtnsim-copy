The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
410(7 to 5), 411(12 to 5), 414(8 to 4), 415(8 to 3), 416(10 to 7), 419(3 to 7), 429(11 to 1), 430(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(415: 90.000000), (430: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(410: 1), (411: 2), (414: 4), (415: 3), (416: 4), (419: 1), (429: 1), (430: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 430: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 414: (to: 3, time: 120.000000),

Node 4: 
Bundle 430: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 416: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7:
