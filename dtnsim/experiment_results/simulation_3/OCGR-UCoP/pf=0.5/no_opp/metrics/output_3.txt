The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
543(7 to 5), 546(12 to 5), 549(8 to 4), 550(8 to 3), 551(10 to 7), 556(3 to 7), 564(11 to 1), 566(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(564: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(543: 3), (546: 2), (549: 3), (550: 3), (551: 3), (556: 2), (564: 3), (566: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
