The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
387(7 to 5), 388(12 to 5), 391(8 to 4), 392(8 to 3), 393(10 to 7), 401(3 to 7), 412(11 to 1), 415(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(412: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(387: 1), (388: 3), (391: 2), (392: 2), (393: 3), (401: 3), (412: 3), (415: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
