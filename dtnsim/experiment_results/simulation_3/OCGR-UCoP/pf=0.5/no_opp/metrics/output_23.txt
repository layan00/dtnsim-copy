The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
549(7 to 5), 552(12 to 5), 556(8 to 4), 559(8 to 3), 560(10 to 7), 568(3 to 7), 577(11 to 1), 581(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(549: 4), (552: 3), (556: 2), (559: 2), (560: 5), (568: 3), (577: 2), (581: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
