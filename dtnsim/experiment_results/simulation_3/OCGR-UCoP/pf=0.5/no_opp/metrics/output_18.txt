The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
513(7 to 5), 514(12 to 5), 522(8 to 4), 523(8 to 3), 524(10 to 7), 536(3 to 7), 544(11 to 1), 548(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(524: 70.000000), (536: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(513: 1), (514: 2), (522: 2), (523: 2), (524: 4), (536: 3), (544: 2), (548: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
