The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
690(7 to 5), 691(12 to 5), 696(8 to 4), 697(8 to 3), 698(10 to 7), 707(3 to 7), 711(11 to 1), 713(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(696: 120.000000), (697: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(690: 1), (691: 2), (696: 3), (697: 2), (698: 3), (707: 1), (711: 3), (713: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
