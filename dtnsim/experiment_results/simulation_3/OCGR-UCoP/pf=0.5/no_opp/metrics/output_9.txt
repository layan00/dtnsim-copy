The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
670(7 to 5), 671(12 to 5), 675(8 to 4), 676(8 to 3), 677(10 to 7), 690(3 to 7), 698(11 to 1), 700(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(670: 1), (671: 4), (675: 2), (676: 2), (677: 3), (690: 2), (698: 2), (700: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
