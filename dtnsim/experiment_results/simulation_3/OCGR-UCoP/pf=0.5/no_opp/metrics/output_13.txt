The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
533(7 to 5), 534(12 to 5), 538(8 to 4), 539(8 to 3), 540(10 to 7), 548(3 to 7), 562(11 to 1), 565(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(565: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(533: 1), (534: 3), (538: 2), (539: 2), (540: 4), (548: 1), (562: 3), (565: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
