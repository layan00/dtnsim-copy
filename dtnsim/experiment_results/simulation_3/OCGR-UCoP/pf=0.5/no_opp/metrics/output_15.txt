The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
99(7 to 5), 102(12 to 5), 108(8 to 4), 110(8 to 3), 111(10 to 7), 113(3 to 7), 124(11 to 1), 127(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(99: 4), (102: 2), (108: 2), (110: 2), (111: 6), (113: 1), (124: 2), (127: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
