The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
99(7 to 5), 102(12 to 5), 108(8 to 4), 111(8 to 3), 112(10 to 7), 121(3 to 7), 130(11 to 1), 131(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(99: 4), (102: 3), (108: 2), (111: 2), (112: 3), (121: 2), (130: 1), (131: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 99: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
