The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
109(7 to 5), 112(12 to 5), 115(8 to 4), 117(8 to 3), 118(10 to 7), 129(3 to 7), 142(11 to 1), 146(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(109: 60.000000), (142: 80.000000), (146: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(109: 5), (112: 2), (115: 2), (117: 2), (118: 5), (129: 3), (142: 3), (146: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
