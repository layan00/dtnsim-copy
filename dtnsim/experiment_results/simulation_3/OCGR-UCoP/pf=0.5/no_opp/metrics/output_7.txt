The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
391(7 to 5), 393(12 to 5), 398(8 to 4), 399(8 to 3), 400(10 to 7), 405(3 to 7), 412(11 to 1), 414(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(398: 120.000000), (399: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(391: 2), (393: 2), (398: 4), (399: 3), (400: 3), (405: 2), (412: 3), (414: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
