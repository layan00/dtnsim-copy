The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
402(7 to 5), 403(12 to 5), 407(8 to 4), 409(8 to 3), 410(10 to 7), 417(3 to 7), 423(11 to 1), 424(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(407: 120.000000), (409: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(402: 1), (403: 4), (407: 4), (409: 3), (410: 3), (417: 1), (423: 1), (424: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
