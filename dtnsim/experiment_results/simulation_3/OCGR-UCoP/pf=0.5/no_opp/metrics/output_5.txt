The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
101(7 to 5), 102(12 to 5), 106(8 to 4), 107(8 to 3), 108(10 to 7), 118(3 to 7), 127(11 to 1), 130(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(127: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(101: 1), (102: 2), (106: 2), (107: 2), (108: 3), (118: 3), (127: 3), (130: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 130: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 102: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
