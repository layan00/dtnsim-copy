The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
389(7 to 5), 390(12 to 5), 396(8 to 4), 397(8 to 3), 398(10 to 7), 403(3 to 7), 414(11 to 1), 417(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(389: 1), (390: 2), (396: 3), (397: 3), (398: 3), (403: 3), (414: 3), (417: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
