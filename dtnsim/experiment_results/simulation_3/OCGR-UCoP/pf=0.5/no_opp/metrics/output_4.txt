The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
685(7 to 5), 688(12 to 5), 694(8 to 4), 696(8 to 3), 697(10 to 7), 707(3 to 7), 715(11 to 1), 718(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(694: 120.000000), (696: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(685: 4), (688: 3), (694: 3), (696: 2), (697: 4), (707: 3), (715: 1), (718: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
