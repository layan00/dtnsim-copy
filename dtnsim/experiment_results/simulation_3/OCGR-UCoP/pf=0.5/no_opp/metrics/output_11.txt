The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(7 to 5), 249(12 to 5), 252(8 to 4), 253(8 to 3), 254(10 to 7), 256(3 to 7), 268(11 to 1), 270(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(268: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 2), (249: 2), (252: 2), (253: 2), (254: 4), (256: 1), (268: 3), (270: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 247: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
