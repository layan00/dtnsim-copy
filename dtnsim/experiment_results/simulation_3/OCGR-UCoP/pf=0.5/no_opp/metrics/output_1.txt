The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
271(7 to 5), 273(12 to 5), 278(8 to 4), 280(8 to 3), 281(10 to 7), 289(3 to 7), 298(11 to 1), 301(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(281: 70.000000), (289: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(271: 2), (273: 3), (278: 3), (280: 3), (281: 5), (289: 3), (298: 1), (301: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
