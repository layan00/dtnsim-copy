The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1557(7 to 5), 1558(12 to 5), 1572(8 to 4), 1573(8 to 3), 1574(10 to 7), 1610(3 to 7), 1655(11 to 1), 1658(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1558: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1557: 5), (1558: 4), (1572: 2), (1573: 2), (1574: 4), (1610: 1), (1655: 3), (1658: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 117 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
