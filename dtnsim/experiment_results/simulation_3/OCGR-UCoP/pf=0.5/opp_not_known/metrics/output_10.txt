The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
239(7 to 5), 240(12 to 5), 254(8 to 4), 255(8 to 3), 256(10 to 7), 296(3 to 7), 349(11 to 1), 352(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(240: 50.000000), (256: 10.000000), (296: 0.000000), (349: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(239: 4), (240: 4), (254: 3), (255: 2), (256: 6), (296: 6), (349: 3), (352: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 94 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
