The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1127(7 to 5), 1128(12 to 5), 1143(8 to 4), 1145(8 to 3), 1146(10 to 7), 1179(3 to 7), 1225(11 to 1), 1228(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1128: 10.000000), (1225: 20.000000), (1228: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1127: 4), (1128: 3), (1143: 2), (1145: 2), (1146: 3), (1179: 1), (1225: 3), (1228: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 74 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
