The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
685(7 to 5), 687(12 to 5), 701(8 to 4), 702(8 to 3), 703(10 to 7), 734(3 to 7), 782(11 to 1), 785(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(687: 50.000000), (703: 10.000000), (782: 20.000000), (785: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(685: 2), (687: 4), (701: 2), (702: 2), (703: 6), (734: 1), (782: 3), (785: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 52 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
