The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1999(7 to 5), 2005(12 to 5), 2023(8 to 4), 2026(8 to 3), 2027(10 to 7), 2060(3 to 7), 2103(11 to 1), 2109(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1999: 20.000000), (2005: 10.000000), (2023: 120.000000), (2026: 90.000000), (2103: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1999: 6), (2005: 3), (2023: 3), (2026: 2), (2027: 6), (2060: 1), (2103: 3), (2109: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 62 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
