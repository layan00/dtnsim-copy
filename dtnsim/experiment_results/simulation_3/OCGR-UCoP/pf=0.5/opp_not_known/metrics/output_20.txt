The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(7 to 5), 247(12 to 5), 262(8 to 4), 263(8 to 3), 264(10 to 7), 298(3 to 7), 349(11 to 1), 352(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 50.000000), (352: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 2), (247: 4), (262: 2), (263: 2), (264: 4), (298: 4), (349: 3), (352: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 104 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
