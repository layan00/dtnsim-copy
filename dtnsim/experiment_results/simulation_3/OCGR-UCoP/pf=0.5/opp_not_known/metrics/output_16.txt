The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
675(7 to 5), 677(12 to 5), 693(8 to 4), 695(8 to 3), 696(10 to 7), 725(3 to 7), 769(11 to 1), 775(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(677: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(675: 2), (677: 3), (693: 3), (695: 3), (696: 4), (725: 5), (769: 3), (775: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 85 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
