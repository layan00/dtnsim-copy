The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2028(7 to 5), 2029(12 to 5), 2046(8 to 4), 2048(8 to 3), 2049(10 to 7), 2084(3 to 7), 2129(11 to 1), 2132(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2029: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2028: 4), (2029: 3), (2046: 2), (2048: 2), (2049: 3), (2084: 2), (2129: 3), (2132: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
