The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1134(7 to 5), 1135(12 to 5), 1150(8 to 4), 1151(8 to 3), 1152(10 to 7), 1181(3 to 7), 1228(11 to 1), 1231(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1135: 50.000000), (1151: 90.000000), (1228: 20.000000), (1231: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1134: 4), (1135: 4), (1150: 4), (1151: 3), (1152: 4), (1181: 1), (1228: 3), (1231: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 94 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
