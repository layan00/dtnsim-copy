The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1565(7 to 5), 1568(12 to 5), 1583(8 to 4), 1584(8 to 3), 1585(10 to 7), 1614(3 to 7), 1658(11 to 1), 1661(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1658: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1565: 3), (1568: 4), (1583: 3), (1584: 3), (1585: 3), (1614: 2), (1658: 3), (1661: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
