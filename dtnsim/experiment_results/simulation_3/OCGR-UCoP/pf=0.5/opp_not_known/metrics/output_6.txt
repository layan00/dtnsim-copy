The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
685(7 to 5), 688(12 to 5), 706(8 to 4), 709(8 to 3), 710(10 to 7), 742(3 to 7), 790(11 to 1), 793(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(688: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(685: 4), (688: 3), (706: 2), (709: 2), (710: 4), (742: 1), (790: 3), (793: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
