The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1115(7 to 5), 1116(12 to 5), 1134(8 to 4), 1136(8 to 3), 1137(10 to 7), 1169(3 to 7), 1215(11 to 1), 1218(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1116: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1115: 5), (1116: 3), (1134: 3), (1136: 3), (1137: 3), (1169: 1), (1215: 3), (1218: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 100 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
