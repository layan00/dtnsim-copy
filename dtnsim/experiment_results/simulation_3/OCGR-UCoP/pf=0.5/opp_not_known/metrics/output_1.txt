The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
700(7 to 5), 702(12 to 5), 718(8 to 4), 719(8 to 3), 720(10 to 7), 755(3 to 7), 799(11 to 1), 802(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(720: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(700: 2), (702: 4), (718: 3), (719: 3), (720: 6), (755: 1), (799: 3), (802: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 129 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
