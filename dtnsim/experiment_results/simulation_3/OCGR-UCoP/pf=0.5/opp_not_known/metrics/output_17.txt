The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1106(7 to 5), 1107(12 to 5), 1123(8 to 4), 1125(8 to 3), 1126(10 to 7), 1163(3 to 7), 1209(11 to 1), 1215(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1107: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1106: 6), (1107: 3), (1123: 2), (1125: 2), (1126: 6), (1163: 4), (1209: 3), (1215: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 125 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
