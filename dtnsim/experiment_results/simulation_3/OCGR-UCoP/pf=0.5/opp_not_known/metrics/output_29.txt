The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2016(7 to 5), 2017(12 to 5), 2034(8 to 4), 2036(8 to 3), 2037(10 to 7), 2074(3 to 7), 2118(11 to 1), 2121(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2016: 60.000000), (2017: 10.000000), (2034: 120.000000), (2036: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2016: 6), (2017: 3), (2034: 3), (2036: 2), (2037: 3), (2074: 4), (2118: 3), (2121: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 78 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
