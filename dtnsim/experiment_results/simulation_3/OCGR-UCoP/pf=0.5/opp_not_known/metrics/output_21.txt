The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
686(7 to 5), 688(12 to 5), 704(8 to 4), 705(8 to 3), 706(10 to 7), 738(3 to 7), 788(11 to 1), 791(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(688: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(686: 2), (688: 4), (704: 2), (705: 2), (706: 4), (738: 4), (788: 3), (791: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
