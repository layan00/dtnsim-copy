The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1122(7 to 5), 1123(12 to 5), 1138(8 to 4), 1139(8 to 3), 1140(10 to 7), 1176(3 to 7), 1221(11 to 1), 1224(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1138: 120.000000), (1139: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1122: 6), (1123: 4), (1138: 4), (1139: 3), (1140: 4), (1176: 4), (1221: 3), (1224: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 126 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
