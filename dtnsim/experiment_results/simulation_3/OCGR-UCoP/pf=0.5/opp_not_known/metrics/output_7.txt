The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1123(7 to 5), 1125(12 to 5), 1142(8 to 4), 1145(8 to 3), 1146(10 to 7), 1177(3 to 7), 1220(11 to 1), 1223(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1125: 10.000000), (1142: 120.000000), (1145: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1123: 5), (1125: 3), (1142: 4), (1145: 3), (1146: 3), (1177: 2), (1220: 3), (1223: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
