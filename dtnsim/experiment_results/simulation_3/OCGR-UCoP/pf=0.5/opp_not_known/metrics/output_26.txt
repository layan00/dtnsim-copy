The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
673(7 to 5), 675(12 to 5), 693(8 to 4), 695(8 to 3), 696(10 to 7), 734(3 to 7), 778(11 to 1), 781(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(675: 50.000000), (693: 120.000000), (695: 90.000000), (696: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(673: 5), (675: 4), (693: 4), (695: 3), (696: 6), (734: 1), (778: 3), (781: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
