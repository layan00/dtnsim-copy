The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2016(7 to 5), 2017(12 to 5), 2033(8 to 4), 2035(8 to 3), 2036(10 to 7), 2075(3 to 7), 2122(11 to 1), 2128(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2017: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2016: 5), (2017: 3), (2033: 2), (2035: 2), (2036: 7), (2075: 1), (2122: 3), (2128: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
