The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
556(7 to 5), 558(12 to 5), 564(8 to 4), 566(8 to 3), 567(10 to 7), 586(3 to 7), 604(11 to 1), 607(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(558: 10.000000), (566: 130.000000), (567: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(556: 3), (558: 3), (564: 3), (566: 7), (567: 3), (586: 1), (604: 3), (607: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
