The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
241(7 to 5), 244(12 to 5), 249(8 to 4), 251(8 to 3), 252(10 to 7), 275(3 to 7), 303(11 to 1), 306(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 60.000000), (244: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(241: 6), (244: 4), (249: 2), (251: 2), (252: 4), (275: 4), (303: 3), (306: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
