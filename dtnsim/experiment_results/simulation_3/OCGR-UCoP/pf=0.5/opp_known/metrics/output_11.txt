The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
572(7 to 5), 574(12 to 5), 578(8 to 4), 579(8 to 3), 580(10 to 7), 597(3 to 7), 621(11 to 1), 624(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(574: 50.000000), (580: 10.000000), (621: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 3), (574: 4), (578: 2), (579: 2), (580: 3), (597: 1), (621: 3), (624: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
