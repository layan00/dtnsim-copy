The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
900(7 to 5), 902(12 to 5), 909(8 to 4), 912(8 to 3), 913(10 to 7), 933(3 to 7), 951(11 to 1), 954(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(902: 10.000000), (909: 120.000000), (912: 90.000000), (913: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(900: 6), (902: 3), (909: 4), (912: 3), (913: 3), (933: 1), (951: 3), (954: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
