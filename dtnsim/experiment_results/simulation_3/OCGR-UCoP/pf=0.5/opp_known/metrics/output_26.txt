The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
569(7 to 5), 571(12 to 5), 579(8 to 4), 581(8 to 3), 582(10 to 7), 608(3 to 7), 628(11 to 1), 631(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(571: 50.000000), (579: 120.000000), (581: 90.000000), (582: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(569: 6), (571: 4), (579: 4), (581: 3), (582: 6), (608: 1), (628: 3), (631: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
