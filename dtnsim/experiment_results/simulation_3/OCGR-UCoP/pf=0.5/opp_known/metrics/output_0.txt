The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(7 to 5), 252(12 to 5), 259(8 to 4), 260(8 to 3), 261(10 to 7), 284(3 to 7), 308(11 to 1), 311(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(259: 120.000000), (260: 90.000000), (261: 10.000000), (311: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 7), (252: 4), (259: 4), (260: 3), (261: 3), (284: 4), (308: 3), (311: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 49 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
