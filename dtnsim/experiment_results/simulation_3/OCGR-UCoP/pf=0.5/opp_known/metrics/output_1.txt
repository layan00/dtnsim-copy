The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
587(7 to 5), 589(12 to 5), 595(8 to 4), 597(8 to 3), 598(10 to 7), 623(3 to 7), 643(11 to 1), 646(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(597: 130.000000), (598: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(587: 6), (589: 4), (595: 3), (597: 7), (598: 6), (623: 1), (643: 3), (646: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
