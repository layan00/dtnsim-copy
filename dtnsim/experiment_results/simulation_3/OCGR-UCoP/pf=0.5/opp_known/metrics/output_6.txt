The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
569(7 to 5), 572(12 to 5), 580(8 to 4), 583(8 to 3), 584(10 to 7), 608(3 to 7), 631(11 to 1), 634(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(572: 10.000000), (584: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(569: 5), (572: 3), (580: 3), (583: 4), (584: 6), (608: 1), (631: 3), (634: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
