The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
901(7 to 5), 902(12 to 5), 910(8 to 4), 912(8 to 3), 913(10 to 7), 935(3 to 7), 957(11 to 1), 960(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(902: 10.000000), (912: 130.000000), (913: 10.000000), (960: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(901: 5), (902: 3), (910: 3), (912: 7), (913: 3), (935: 1), (957: 3), (960: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
