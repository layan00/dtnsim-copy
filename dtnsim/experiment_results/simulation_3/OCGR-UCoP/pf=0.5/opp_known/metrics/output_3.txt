The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1243(7 to 5), 1246(12 to 5), 1251(8 to 4), 1252(8 to 3), 1253(10 to 7), 1272(3 to 7), 1291(11 to 1), 1294(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1252: 130.000000), (1291: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1243: 4), (1246: 4), (1251: 3), (1252: 7), (1253: 4), (1272: 1), (1291: 3), (1294: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
