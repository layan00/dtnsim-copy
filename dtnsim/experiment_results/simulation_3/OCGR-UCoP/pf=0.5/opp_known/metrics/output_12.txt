The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
896(7 to 5), 897(12 to 5), 902(8 to 4), 904(8 to 3), 905(10 to 7), 930(3 to 7), 952(11 to 1), 955(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(897: 10.000000), (905: 10.000000), (952: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(896: 4), (897: 3), (902: 2), (904: 2), (905: 6), (930: 1), (952: 3), (955: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
