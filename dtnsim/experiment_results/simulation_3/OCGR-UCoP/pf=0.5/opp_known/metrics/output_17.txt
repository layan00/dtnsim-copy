The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
878(7 to 5), 879(12 to 5), 885(8 to 4), 887(8 to 3), 888(10 to 7), 914(3 to 7), 936(11 to 1), 939(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(879: 10.000000), (888: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(878: 6), (879: 3), (885: 2), (887: 2), (888: 3), (914: 4), (936: 3), (939: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
