The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1570(7 to 5), 1571(12 to 5), 1578(8 to 4), 1580(8 to 3), 1581(10 to 7), 1606(3 to 7), 1628(11 to 1), 1635(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1571: 10.000000), (1581: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1570: 4), (1571: 3), (1578: 5), (1580: 5), (1581: 3), (1606: 1), (1628: 3), (1635: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
