The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
416(7 to 5), 417(12 to 5), 420(8 to 4), 421(8 to 3), 422(10 to 7), 428(3 to 7), 434(11 to 1), 437(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(416: 1), (417: 2), (420: 2), (421: 2), (422: 5), (428: 3), (434: 1), (437: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
