The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
186(7 to 5), 187(12 to 5), 188(8 to 4), 189(8 to 3), 190(10 to 7), 193(3 to 7), 195(11 to 1), 196(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 1), (187: 2), (188: 2), (189: 2), (190: 3), (193: 1), (195: 1), (196: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
