The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
89(7 to 5), 91(12 to 5), 93(8 to 4), 94(8 to 3), 95(10 to 7), 102(3 to 7), 108(11 to 1), 109(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(109: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(89: 2), (91: 2), (93: 2), (94: 2), (95: 4), (102: 2), (108: 1), (109: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
