The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
275(7 to 5), 276(12 to 5), 278(8 to 4), 279(8 to 3), 280(10 to 7), 283(3 to 7), 286(11 to 1), 287(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(275: 1), (276: 2), (278: 2), (279: 2), (280: 3), (283: 1), (286: 1), (287: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 287: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
