The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
502(7 to 5), 505(12 to 5), 508(8 to 4), 510(8 to 3), 511(10 to 7), 517(3 to 7), 521(11 to 1), 522(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(510: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(502: 4), (505: 2), (508: 3), (510: 2), (511: 3), (517: 1), (521: 1), (522: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 502: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 502: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
