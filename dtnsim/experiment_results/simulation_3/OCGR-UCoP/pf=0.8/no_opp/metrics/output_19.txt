The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
475(7 to 5), 476(12 to 5), 477(8 to 4), 478(8 to 3), 479(10 to 7), 483(3 to 7), 486(11 to 1), 487(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(475: 1), (476: 2), (477: 2), (478: 2), (479: 3), (483: 1), (486: 1), (487: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
