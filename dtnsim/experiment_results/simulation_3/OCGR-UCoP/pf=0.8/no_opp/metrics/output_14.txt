The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
487(7 to 5), 488(12 to 5), 492(8 to 4), 493(8 to 3), 494(10 to 7), 496(3 to 7), 498(11 to 1), 500(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(487: 1), (488: 2), (492: 3), (493: 3), (494: 3), (496: 1), (498: 2), (500: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
