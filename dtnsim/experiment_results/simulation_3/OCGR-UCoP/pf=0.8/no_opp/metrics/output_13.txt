The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
382(7 to 5), 383(12 to 5), 385(8 to 4), 386(8 to 3), 387(10 to 7), 389(3 to 7), 395(11 to 1), 397(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(397: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(382: 1), (383: 2), (385: 2), (386: 2), (387: 3), (389: 1), (395: 3), (397: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
