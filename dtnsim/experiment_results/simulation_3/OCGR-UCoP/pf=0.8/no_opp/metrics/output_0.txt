The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(7 to 5), 85(12 to 5), 86(8 to 4), 87(8 to 3), 88(10 to 7), 95(3 to 7), 101(11 to 1), 103(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(87: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 1), (85: 2), (86: 3), (87: 2), (88: 3), (95: 1), (101: 2), (103: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 51 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 103: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
