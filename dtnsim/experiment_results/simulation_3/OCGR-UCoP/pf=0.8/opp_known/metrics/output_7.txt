The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
805(7 to 5), 806(12 to 5), 810(8 to 4), 811(8 to 3), 812(10 to 7), 830(3 to 7), 847(11 to 1), 850(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(805: 4), (806: 4), (810: 2), (811: 2), (812: 4), (830: 1), (847: 3), (850: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
