The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1373(7 to 5), 1374(12 to 5), 1380(8 to 4), 1381(8 to 3), 1382(10 to 7), 1401(3 to 7), 1415(11 to 1), 1418(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1382: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1373: 4), (1374: 4), (1380: 3), (1381: 4), (1382: 3), (1401: 1), (1415: 3), (1418: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
