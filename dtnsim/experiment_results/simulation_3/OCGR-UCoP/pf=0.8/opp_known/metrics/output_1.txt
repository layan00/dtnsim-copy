The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
525(7 to 5), 527(12 to 5), 532(8 to 4), 533(8 to 3), 534(10 to 7), 555(3 to 7), 572(11 to 1), 575(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(534: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(525: 3), (527: 4), (532: 2), (533: 2), (534: 6), (555: 1), (572: 3), (575: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
