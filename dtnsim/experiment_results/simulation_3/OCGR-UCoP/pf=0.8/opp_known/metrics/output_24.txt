The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1405(7 to 5), 1406(12 to 5), 1411(8 to 4), 1413(8 to 3), 1414(10 to 7), 1438(3 to 7), 1457(11 to 1), 1464(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1406: 10.000000), (1414: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1405: 4), (1406: 3), (1411: 5), (1413: 5), (1414: 6), (1438: 1), (1457: 3), (1464: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
