The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
780(7 to 5), 781(12 to 5), 785(8 to 4), 786(8 to 3), 787(10 to 7), 806(3 to 7), 821(11 to 1), 824(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(787: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(780: 4), (781: 4), (785: 2), (786: 2), (787: 3), (806: 1), (821: 3), (824: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
