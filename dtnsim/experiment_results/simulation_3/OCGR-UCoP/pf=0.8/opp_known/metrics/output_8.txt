The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1093(7 to 5), 1094(12 to 5), 1097(8 to 4), 1098(8 to 3), 1099(10 to 7), 1120(3 to 7), 1135(11 to 1), 1138(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1093: 5), (1094: 4), (1097: 2), (1098: 2), (1099: 4), (1120: 1), (1135: 3), (1138: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
