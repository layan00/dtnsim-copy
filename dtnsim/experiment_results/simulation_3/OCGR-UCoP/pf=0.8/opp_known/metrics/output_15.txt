The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(7 to 5), 221(12 to 5), 228(8 to 4), 230(8 to 3), 231(10 to 7), 248(3 to 7), 266(11 to 1), 269(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 50.000000), (231: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 5), (221: 4), (228: 2), (230: 2), (231: 3), (248: 1), (266: 3), (269: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
