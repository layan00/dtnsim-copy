The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1088(7 to 5), 1089(12 to 5), 1094(8 to 4), 1095(8 to 3), 1096(10 to 7), 1117(3 to 7), 1138(11 to 1), 1141(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1088: 4), (1089: 4), (1094: 2), (1095: 2), (1096: 4), (1117: 4), (1138: 3), (1141: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
