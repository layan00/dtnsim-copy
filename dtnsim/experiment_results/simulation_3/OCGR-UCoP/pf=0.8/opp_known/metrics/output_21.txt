The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
516(7 to 5), 518(12 to 5), 522(8 to 4), 524(8 to 3), 525(10 to 7), 545(3 to 7), 563(11 to 1), 566(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(518: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(516: 6), (518: 4), (522: 2), (524: 2), (525: 4), (545: 1), (563: 3), (566: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
