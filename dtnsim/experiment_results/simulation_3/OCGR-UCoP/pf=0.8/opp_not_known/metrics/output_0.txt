The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(7 to 5), 221(12 to 5), 234(8 to 4), 235(8 to 3), 236(10 to 7), 273(3 to 7), 318(11 to 1), 321(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 6), (221: 4), (234: 3), (235: 2), (236: 4), (273: 4), (318: 3), (321: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 137 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
