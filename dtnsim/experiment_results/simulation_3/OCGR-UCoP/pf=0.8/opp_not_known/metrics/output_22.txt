The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1032(7 to 5), 1033(12 to 5), 1046(8 to 4), 1047(8 to 3), 1048(10 to 7), 1079(3 to 7), 1118(11 to 1), 1121(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1032: 5), (1033: 4), (1046: 3), (1047: 3), (1048: 3), (1079: 1), (1118: 3), (1121: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 118 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
