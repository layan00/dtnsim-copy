The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1011(7 to 5), 1012(12 to 5), 1027(8 to 4), 1029(8 to 3), 1030(10 to 7), 1060(3 to 7), 1104(11 to 1), 1108(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1012: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1011: 4), (1012: 3), (1027: 3), (1029: 3), (1030: 3), (1060: 3), (1104: 3), (1108: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 78 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
