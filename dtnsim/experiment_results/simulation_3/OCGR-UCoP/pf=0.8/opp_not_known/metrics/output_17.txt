The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1003(7 to 5), 1004(12 to 5), 1018(8 to 4), 1019(8 to 3), 1020(10 to 7), 1049(3 to 7), 1088(11 to 1), 1091(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1003: 4), (1004: 4), (1018: 2), (1019: 2), (1020: 3), (1049: 1), (1088: 3), (1091: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 96 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
