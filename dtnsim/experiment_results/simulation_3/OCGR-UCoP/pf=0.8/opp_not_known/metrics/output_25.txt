The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(7 to 5), 213(12 to 5), 226(8 to 4), 227(8 to 3), 228(10 to 7), 265(3 to 7), 303(11 to 1), 306(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(228: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 4), (213: 4), (226: 3), (227: 2), (228: 6), (265: 1), (303: 3), (306: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 90 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
