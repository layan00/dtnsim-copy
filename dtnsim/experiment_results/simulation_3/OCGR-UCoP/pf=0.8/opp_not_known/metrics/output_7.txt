The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1036(7 to 5), 1037(12 to 5), 1051(8 to 4), 1052(8 to 3), 1053(10 to 7), 1081(3 to 7), 1122(11 to 1), 1125(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1036: 4), (1037: 4), (1051: 2), (1052: 2), (1053: 3), (1081: 1), (1122: 3), (1125: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
