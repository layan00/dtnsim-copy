The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1432(7 to 5), 1433(12 to 5), 1446(8 to 4), 1447(8 to 3), 1448(10 to 7), 1481(3 to 7), 1520(11 to 1), 1523(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1432: 5), (1433: 4), (1446: 2), (1447: 2), (1448: 4), (1481: 1), (1520: 3), (1523: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
