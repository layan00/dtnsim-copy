The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
632(7 to 5), 635(12 to 5), 650(8 to 4), 652(8 to 3), 653(10 to 7), 688(3 to 7), 728(11 to 1), 731(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(653: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(632: 4), (635: 4), (650: 2), (652: 2), (653: 6), (688: 1), (728: 3), (731: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 77 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
