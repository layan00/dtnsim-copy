The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1036(7 to 5), 1037(12 to 5), 1050(8 to 4), 1051(8 to 3), 1052(10 to 7), 1080(3 to 7), 1119(11 to 1), 1122(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1051: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1036: 4), (1037: 4), (1050: 4), (1051: 3), (1052: 3), (1080: 1), (1119: 3), (1122: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 99 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
