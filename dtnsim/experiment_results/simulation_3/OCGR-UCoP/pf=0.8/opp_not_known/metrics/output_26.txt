The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
608(7 to 5), 609(12 to 5), 624(8 to 4), 625(8 to 3), 626(10 to 7), 662(3 to 7), 701(11 to 1), 704(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(626: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(608: 5), (609: 4), (624: 2), (625: 2), (626: 6), (662: 1), (701: 3), (704: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 86 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
