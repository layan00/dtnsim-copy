The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
639(7 to 5), 641(12 to 5), 656(8 to 4), 657(8 to 3), 658(10 to 7), 691(3 to 7), 732(11 to 1), 735(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(658: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(639: 2), (641: 4), (656: 2), (657: 2), (658: 6), (691: 1), (732: 3), (735: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 109 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
