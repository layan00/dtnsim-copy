The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1409(7 to 5), 1410(12 to 5), 1424(8 to 4), 1425(8 to 3), 1426(10 to 7), 1454(3 to 7), 1496(11 to 1), 1499(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1499: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1409: 4), (1410: 4), (1424: 2), (1425: 2), (1426: 3), (1454: 1), (1496: 3), (1499: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 121 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
