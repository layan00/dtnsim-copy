The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1848(7 to 5), 1849(12 to 5), 1864(8 to 4), 1866(8 to 3), 1867(10 to 7), 1899(3 to 7), 1940(11 to 1), 1943(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1849: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1848: 4), (1849: 3), (1864: 2), (1866: 2), (1867: 3), (1899: 1), (1940: 3), (1943: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
