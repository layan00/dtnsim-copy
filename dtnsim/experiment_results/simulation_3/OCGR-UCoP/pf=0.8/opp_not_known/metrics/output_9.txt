The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1831(7 to 5), 1832(12 to 5), 1847(8 to 4), 1848(8 to 3), 1849(10 to 7), 1878(3 to 7), 1918(11 to 1), 1921(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1831: 4), (1832: 4), (1847: 3), (1848: 3), (1849: 3), (1878: 1), (1918: 3), (1921: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
