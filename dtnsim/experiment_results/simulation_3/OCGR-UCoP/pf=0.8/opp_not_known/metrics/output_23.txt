The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1438(7 to 5), 1439(12 to 5), 1453(8 to 4), 1454(8 to 3), 1455(10 to 7), 1487(3 to 7), 1529(11 to 1), 1538(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1438: 4), (1439: 4), (1453: 2), (1454: 2), (1455: 7), (1487: 5), (1529: 3), (1538: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 110 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
