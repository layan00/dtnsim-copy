The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1422(7 to 5), 1423(12 to 5), 1438(8 to 4), 1439(8 to 3), 1440(10 to 7), 1472(3 to 7), 1514(11 to 1), 1517(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1422: 4), (1423: 4), (1438: 2), (1439: 2), (1440: 3), (1472: 1), (1514: 3), (1517: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 133 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
