The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(7 to 5), 215(12 to 5), 228(8 to 4), 229(8 to 3), 230(10 to 7), 258(3 to 7), 296(11 to 1), 299(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(296: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 4), (215: 4), (228: 2), (229: 2), (230: 3), (258: 1), (296: 3), (299: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 98 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
