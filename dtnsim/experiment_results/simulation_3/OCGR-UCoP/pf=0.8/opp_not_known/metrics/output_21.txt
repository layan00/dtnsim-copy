The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
631(7 to 5), 633(12 to 5), 647(8 to 4), 648(8 to 3), 649(10 to 7), 679(3 to 7), 721(11 to 1), 724(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(633: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(631: 2), (633: 4), (647: 2), (648: 2), (649: 4), (679: 1), (721: 3), (724: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 89 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
