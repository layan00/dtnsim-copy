The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1400(7 to 5), 1401(12 to 5), 1416(8 to 4), 1417(8 to 3), 1418(10 to 7), 1452(3 to 7), 1494(11 to 1), 1497(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1400: 6), (1401: 4), (1416: 2), (1417: 2), (1418: 4), (1452: 4), (1494: 3), (1497: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
