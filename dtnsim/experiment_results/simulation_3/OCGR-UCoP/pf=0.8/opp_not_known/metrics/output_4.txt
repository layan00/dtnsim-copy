The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1825(7 to 5), 1828(12 to 5), 1843(8 to 4), 1846(8 to 3), 1847(10 to 7), 1877(3 to 7), 1917(11 to 1), 1920(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1828: 10.000000), (1846: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1825: 5), (1828: 3), (1843: 3), (1846: 2), (1847: 3), (1877: 1), (1917: 3), (1920: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 68 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
