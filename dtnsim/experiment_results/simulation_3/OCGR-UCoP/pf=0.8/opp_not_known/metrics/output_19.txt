The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1800(7 to 5), 1801(12 to 5), 1814(8 to 4), 1815(8 to 3), 1816(10 to 7), 1846(3 to 7), 1885(11 to 1), 1888(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1885: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1800: 4), (1801: 4), (1814: 2), (1815: 2), (1816: 3), (1846: 1), (1885: 3), (1888: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 89 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
