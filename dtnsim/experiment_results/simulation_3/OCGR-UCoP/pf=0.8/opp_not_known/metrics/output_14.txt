The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1808(7 to 5), 1809(12 to 5), 1825(8 to 4), 1826(8 to 3), 1827(10 to 7), 1855(3 to 7), 1893(11 to 1), 1896(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1808: 4), (1809: 4), (1825: 3), (1826: 3), (1827: 3), (1855: 1), (1893: 3), (1896: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 111 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
