The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1428(7 to 5), 1430(12 to 5), 1444(8 to 4), 1445(8 to 3), 1446(10 to 7), 1471(3 to 7), 1511(11 to 1), 1514(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1428: 2), (1430: 4), (1444: 2), (1445: 2), (1446: 3), (1471: 1), (1511: 3), (1514: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 84 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
