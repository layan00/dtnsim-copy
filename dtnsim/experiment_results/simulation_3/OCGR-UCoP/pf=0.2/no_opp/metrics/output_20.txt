The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
129(7 to 5), 132(12 to 5), 139(8 to 4), 142(8 to 3), 143(10 to 7), 158(3 to 7), 176(11 to 1), 180(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(129: 60.000000), (132: 50.000000), (139: 120.000000), (142: 90.000000), (143: 70.000000), (158: 55.000000), (176: 80.000000), (180: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(129: 5), (132: 4), (139: 3), (142: 2), (143: 5), (158: 3), (176: 3), (180: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
