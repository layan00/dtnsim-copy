The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
510(7 to 5), 511(12 to 5), 517(8 to 4), 519(8 to 3), 520(10 to 7), 533(3 to 7), 546(11 to 1), 548(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(511: 50.000000), (517: 120.000000), (519: 90.000000), (546: 80.000000), (548: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(510: 1), (511: 4), (517: 3), (519: 2), (520: 4), (533: 2), (546: 3), (548: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
