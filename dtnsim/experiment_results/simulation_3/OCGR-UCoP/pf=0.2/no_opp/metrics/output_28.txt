The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
699(7 to 5), 702(12 to 5), 708(8 to 4), 709(8 to 3), 710(10 to 7), 722(3 to 7), 736(11 to 1), 740(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(710: 70.000000), (722: 55.000000), (736: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(699: 3), (702: 2), (708: 2), (709: 2), (710: 5), (722: 3), (736: 3), (740: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
