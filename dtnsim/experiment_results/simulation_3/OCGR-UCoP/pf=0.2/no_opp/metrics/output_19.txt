The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
862(7 to 5), 864(12 to 5), 873(8 to 4), 875(8 to 3), 876(10 to 7), 888(3 to 7), 903(11 to 1), 907(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(875: 90.000000), (876: 70.000000), (888: 55.000000), (907: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(862: 2), (864: 4), (873: 3), (875: 2), (876: 4), (888: 3), (903: 2), (907: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
