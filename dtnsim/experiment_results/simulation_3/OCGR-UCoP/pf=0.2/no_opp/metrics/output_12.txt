The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
465(7 to 5), 466(12 to 5), 473(8 to 4), 475(8 to 3), 476(10 to 7), 484(3 to 7), 500(11 to 1), 504(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(500: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(465: 1), (466: 3), (473: 3), (475: 3), (476: 5), (484: 3), (500: 3), (504: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
