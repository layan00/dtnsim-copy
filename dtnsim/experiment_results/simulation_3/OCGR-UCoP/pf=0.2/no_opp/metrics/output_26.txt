The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
316(7 to 5), 319(12 to 5), 327(8 to 4), 330(8 to 3), 331(10 to 7), 348(3 to 7), 364(11 to 1), 367(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(316: 60.000000), (319: 50.000000), (327: 120.000000), (330: 90.000000), (331: 70.000000), (348: 55.000000), (367: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(316: 5), (319: 4), (327: 3), (330: 2), (331: 4), (348: 3), (364: 1), (367: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
