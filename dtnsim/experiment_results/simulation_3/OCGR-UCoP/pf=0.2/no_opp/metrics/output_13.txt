The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
650(7 to 5), 653(12 to 5), 660(8 to 4), 663(8 to 3), 664(10 to 7), 681(3 to 7), 698(11 to 1), 702(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(650: 60.000000), (653: 50.000000), (660: 120.000000), (663: 90.000000), (664: 70.000000), (681: 55.000000), (702: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(650: 5), (653: 4), (660: 3), (663: 2), (664: 4), (681: 3), (698: 3), (702: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
