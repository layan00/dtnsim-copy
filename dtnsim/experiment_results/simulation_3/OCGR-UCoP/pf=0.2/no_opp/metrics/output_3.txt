The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
705(7 to 5), 708(12 to 5), 714(8 to 4), 715(8 to 3), 716(10 to 7), 726(3 to 7), 740(11 to 1), 743(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(726: 55.000000), (740: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(705: 3), (708: 2), (714: 2), (715: 2), (716: 3), (726: 3), (740: 3), (743: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
