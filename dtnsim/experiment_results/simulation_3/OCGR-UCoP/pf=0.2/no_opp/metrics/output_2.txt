The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
517(7 to 5), 520(12 to 5), 527(8 to 4), 528(8 to 3), 529(10 to 7), 537(3 to 7), 549(11 to 1), 552(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 120.000000), (528: 90.000000), (529: 70.000000), (549: 80.000000), (552: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(517: 3), (520: 2), (527: 4), (528: 3), (529: 4), (537: 1), (549: 3), (552: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
