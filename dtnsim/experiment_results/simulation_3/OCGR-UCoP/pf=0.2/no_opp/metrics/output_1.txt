The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
326(7 to 5), 329(12 to 5), 336(8 to 4), 339(8 to 3), 340(10 to 7), 353(3 to 7), 368(11 to 1), 372(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(326: 60.000000), (329: 50.000000), (340: 70.000000), (353: 55.000000), (368: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(326: 5), (329: 4), (336: 3), (339: 3), (340: 5), (353: 3), (368: 3), (372: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
