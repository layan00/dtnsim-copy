The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
328(7 to 5), 330(12 to 5), 338(8 to 4), 340(8 to 3), 341(10 to 7), 356(3 to 7), 370(11 to 1), 372(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(330: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(328: 2), (330: 4), (338: 2), (340: 2), (341: 3), (356: 2), (370: 2), (372: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
