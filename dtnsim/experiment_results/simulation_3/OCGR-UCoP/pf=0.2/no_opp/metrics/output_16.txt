The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
305(7 to 5), 308(12 to 5), 314(8 to 4), 316(8 to 3), 317(10 to 7), 331(3 to 7), 342(11 to 1), 345(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(316: 90.000000), (317: 70.000000), (331: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(305: 4), (308: 4), (314: 3), (316: 2), (317: 4), (331: 3), (342: 1), (345: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
