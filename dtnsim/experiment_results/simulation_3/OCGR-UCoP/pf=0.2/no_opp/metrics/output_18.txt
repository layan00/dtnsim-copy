The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
672(7 to 5), 675(12 to 5), 683(8 to 4), 684(8 to 3), 685(10 to 7), 698(3 to 7), 712(11 to 1), 716(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(684: 90.000000), (685: 70.000000), (698: 55.000000), (716: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(672: 3), (675: 2), (683: 3), (684: 2), (685: 4), (698: 3), (712: 2), (716: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
