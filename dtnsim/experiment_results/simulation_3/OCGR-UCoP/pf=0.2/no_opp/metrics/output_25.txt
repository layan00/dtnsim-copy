The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
125(7 to 5), 128(12 to 5), 137(8 to 4), 140(8 to 3), 141(10 to 7), 157(3 to 7), 173(11 to 1), 175(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(125: 60.000000), (128: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(125: 5), (128: 4), (137: 2), (140: 2), (141: 3), (157: 2), (173: 2), (175: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
