The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
122(7 to 5), 125(12 to 5), 134(8 to 4), 137(8 to 3), 138(10 to 7), 150(3 to 7), 165(11 to 1), 168(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(122: 60.000000), (125: 50.000000), (138: 70.000000), (165: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(122: 5), (125: 4), (134: 2), (137: 2), (138: 4), (150: 1), (165: 3), (168: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
