The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
508(7 to 5), 509(12 to 5), 517(8 to 4), 518(8 to 3), 519(10 to 7), 528(3 to 7), 543(11 to 1), 547(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 120.000000), (518: 90.000000), (543: 80.000000), (547: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(508: 1), (509: 2), (517: 4), (518: 3), (519: 4), (528: 3), (543: 3), (547: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
