The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
511(7 to 5), 513(12 to 5), 521(8 to 4), 523(8 to 3), 524(10 to 7), 534(3 to 7), 546(11 to 1), 550(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(521: 120.000000), (523: 90.000000), (524: 70.000000), (534: 55.000000), (546: 80.000000), (550: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(511: 2), (513: 3), (521: 4), (523: 3), (524: 4), (534: 3), (546: 3), (550: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
