The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
120(7 to 5), 121(12 to 5), 128(8 to 4), 130(8 to 3), 131(10 to 7), 144(3 to 7), 158(11 to 1), 160(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(121: 50.000000), (128: 120.000000), (130: 90.000000), (158: 80.000000), (160: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(120: 1), (121: 4), (128: 3), (130: 2), (131: 3), (144: 1), (158: 3), (160: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
