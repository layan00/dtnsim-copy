The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
485(7 to 5), 488(12 to 5), 495(8 to 4), 496(8 to 3), 497(10 to 7), 510(3 to 7), 524(11 to 1), 528(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 90.000000), (497: 70.000000), (510: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(485: 3), (488: 2), (495: 3), (496: 2), (497: 4), (510: 3), (524: 2), (528: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
