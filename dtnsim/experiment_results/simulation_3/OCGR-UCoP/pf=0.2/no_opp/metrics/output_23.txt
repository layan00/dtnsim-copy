The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
699(7 to 5), 702(12 to 5), 707(8 to 4), 710(8 to 3), 711(10 to 7), 726(3 to 7), 740(11 to 1), 744(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(707: 120.000000), (710: 90.000000), (711: 70.000000), (726: 55.000000), (740: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(699: 5), (702: 4), (707: 3), (710: 2), (711: 5), (726: 3), (740: 3), (744: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
