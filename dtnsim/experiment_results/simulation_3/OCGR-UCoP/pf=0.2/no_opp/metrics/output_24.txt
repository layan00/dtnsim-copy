The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
902(7 to 5), 905(12 to 5), 914(8 to 4), 917(8 to 3), 918(10 to 7), 935(3 to 7), 951(11 to 1), 955(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(902: 60.000000), (905: 50.000000), (914: 120.000000), (917: 90.000000), (918: 70.000000), (935: 55.000000), (951: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(902: 5), (905: 4), (914: 3), (917: 2), (918: 4), (935: 3), (951: 3), (955: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
