The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
888(7 to 5), 889(12 to 5), 898(8 to 4), 900(8 to 3), 901(10 to 7), 917(3 to 7), 932(11 to 1), 934(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(889: 50.000000), (898: 120.000000), (900: 90.000000), (932: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(888: 1), (889: 4), (898: 3), (900: 2), (901: 3), (917: 2), (932: 3), (934: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
