The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
313(7 to 5), 316(12 to 5), 323(8 to 4), 325(8 to 3), 326(10 to 7), 342(3 to 7), 361(11 to 1), 365(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(313: 60.000000), (316: 50.000000), (326: 70.000000), (342: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(313: 5), (316: 5), (323: 2), (325: 2), (326: 5), (342: 3), (361: 2), (365: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
