The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
707(7 to 5), 710(12 to 5), 716(8 to 4), 717(8 to 3), 718(10 to 7), 732(3 to 7), 746(11 to 1), 750(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(716: 120.000000), (717: 90.000000), (746: 80.000000), (750: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(707: 3), (710: 2), (716: 3), (717: 2), (718: 4), (732: 3), (746: 3), (750: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
