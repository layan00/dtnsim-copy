The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
883(7 to 5), 886(12 to 5), 893(8 to 4), 895(8 to 3), 896(10 to 7), 908(3 to 7), 918(11 to 1), 922(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(893: 120.000000), (895: 90.000000), (896: 70.000000), (908: 55.000000), (918: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(883: 4), (886: 4), (893: 3), (895: 2), (896: 4), (908: 3), (918: 3), (922: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
