The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
894(7 to 5), 895(12 to 5), 901(8 to 4), 902(8 to 3), 903(10 to 7), 920(3 to 7), 931(11 to 1), 934(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(920: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(894: 1), (895: 5), (901: 2), (902: 2), (903: 3), (920: 3), (931: 2), (934: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
