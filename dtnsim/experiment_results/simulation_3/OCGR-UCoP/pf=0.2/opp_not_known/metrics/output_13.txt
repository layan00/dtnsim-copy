The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1700(7 to 5), 1703(12 to 5), 1721(8 to 4), 1724(8 to 3), 1725(10 to 7), 1765(3 to 7), 1822(11 to 1), 1829(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1700: 60.000000), (1703: 10.000000), (1721: 120.000000), (1724: 90.000000), (1725: 50.000000), (1765: 0.000000), (1822: 20.000000), (1829: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1700: 6), (1703: 3), (1721: 3), (1724: 2), (1725: 6), (1765: 6), (1822: 3), (1829: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 47 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
