The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1736(7 to 5), 1742(12 to 5), 1759(8 to 4), 1760(8 to 3), 1761(10 to 7), 1797(3 to 7), 1849(11 to 1), 1860(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1736: 60.000000), (1742: 50.000000), (1761: 50.000000), (1797: 35.000000), (1849: 20.000000), (1860: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1736: 7), (1742: 4), (1759: 2), (1760: 2), (1761: 7), (1797: 5), (1849: 3), (1860: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 58 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
