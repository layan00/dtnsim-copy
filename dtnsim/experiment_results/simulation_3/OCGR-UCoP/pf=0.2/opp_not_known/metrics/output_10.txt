The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
256(7 to 5), 257(12 to 5), 275(8 to 4), 276(8 to 3), 277(10 to 7), 321(3 to 7), 378(11 to 1), 381(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(256: 60.000000), (257: 50.000000), (275: 120.000000), (276: 90.000000), (277: 10.000000), (321: 0.000000), (378: 20.000000), (381: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(256: 6), (257: 4), (275: 3), (276: 2), (277: 6), (321: 6), (378: 3), (381: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 67 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
