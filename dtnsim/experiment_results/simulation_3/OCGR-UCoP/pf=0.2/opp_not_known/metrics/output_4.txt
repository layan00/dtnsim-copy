The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2226(7 to 5), 2232(12 to 5), 2251(8 to 4), 2254(8 to 3), 2255(10 to 7), 2289(3 to 7), 2334(11 to 1), 2340(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2226: 20.000000), (2232: 10.000000), (2251: 120.000000), (2254: 90.000000), (2334: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2226: 6), (2232: 3), (2251: 3), (2254: 2), (2255: 6), (2289: 1), (2334: 3), (2340: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 69 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
