The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1239(7 to 5), 1240(12 to 5), 1260(8 to 4), 1262(8 to 3), 1263(10 to 7), 1300(3 to 7), 1354(11 to 1), 1361(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1239: 60.000000), (1240: 10.000000), (1260: 120.000000), (1262: 90.000000), (1263: 50.000000), (1354: 20.000000), (1361: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1239: 6), (1240: 3), (1260: 4), (1262: 3), (1263: 6), (1300: 4), (1354: 3), (1361: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 80 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
