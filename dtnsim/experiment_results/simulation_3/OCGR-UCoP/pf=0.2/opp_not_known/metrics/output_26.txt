The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
747(7 to 5), 753(12 to 5), 772(8 to 4), 775(8 to 3), 776(10 to 7), 815(3 to 7), 870(11 to 1), 877(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(747: 20.000000), (753: 10.000000), (772: 120.000000), (775: 90.000000), (776: 50.000000), (815: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(747: 6), (753: 3), (772: 3), (775: 2), (776: 6), (815: 6), (870: 3), (877: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 65 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
