The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
738(7 to 5), 744(12 to 5), 762(8 to 4), 765(8 to 3), 766(10 to 7), 802(3 to 7), 848(11 to 1), 855(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(738: 20.000000), (744: 10.000000), (765: 90.000000), (766: 50.000000), (848: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(738: 6), (744: 3), (762: 3), (765: 2), (766: 6), (802: 1), (848: 3), (855: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
