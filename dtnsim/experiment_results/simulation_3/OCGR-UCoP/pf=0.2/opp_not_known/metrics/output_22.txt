The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1241(7 to 5), 1242(12 to 5), 1259(8 to 4), 1261(8 to 3), 1262(10 to 7), 1302(3 to 7), 1353(11 to 1), 1356(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1241: 60.000000), (1242: 10.000000), (1259: 120.000000), (1261: 90.000000), (1353: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1241: 6), (1242: 3), (1259: 3), (1261: 2), (1262: 4), (1302: 4), (1353: 3), (1356: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 88 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
