The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
265(7 to 5), 271(12 to 5), 291(8 to 4), 294(8 to 3), 295(10 to 7), 331(3 to 7), 382(11 to 1), 389(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(265: 20.000000), (271: 10.000000), (291: 120.000000), (294: 90.000000), (295: 50.000000), (382: 20.000000), (389: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(265: 6), (271: 3), (291: 3), (294: 2), (295: 6), (331: 4), (382: 3), (389: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 69 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
