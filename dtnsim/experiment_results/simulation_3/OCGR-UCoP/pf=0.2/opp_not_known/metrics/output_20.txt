The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
265(7 to 5), 271(12 to 5), 289(8 to 4), 292(8 to 3), 293(10 to 7), 330(3 to 7), 387(11 to 1), 394(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(265: 20.000000), (271: 10.000000), (289: 120.000000), (292: 90.000000), (293: 50.000000), (330: 0.000000), (394: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(265: 6), (271: 3), (289: 3), (292: 2), (293: 7), (330: 6), (387: 3), (394: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 58 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
