The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
260(7 to 5), 266(12 to 5), 283(8 to 4), 286(8 to 3), 287(10 to 7), 325(3 to 7), 378(11 to 1), 385(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(260: 20.000000), (266: 10.000000), (283: 120.000000), (286: 90.000000), (287: 50.000000), (325: 0.000000), (385: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(260: 6), (266: 3), (283: 3), (286: 2), (287: 6), (325: 6), (378: 3), (385: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 51 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
