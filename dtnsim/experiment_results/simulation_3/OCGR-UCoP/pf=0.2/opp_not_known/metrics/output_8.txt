The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1744(7 to 5), 1750(12 to 5), 1767(8 to 4), 1770(8 to 3), 1771(10 to 7), 1809(3 to 7), 1861(11 to 1), 1868(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1744: 20.000000), (1750: 10.000000), (1767: 120.000000), (1770: 90.000000), (1771: 50.000000), (1861: 20.000000), (1868: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1744: 6), (1750: 3), (1767: 3), (1770: 2), (1771: 6), (1809: 4), (1861: 3), (1868: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 62 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
