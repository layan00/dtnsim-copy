The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
762(7 to 5), 764(12 to 5), 783(8 to 4), 786(8 to 3), 787(10 to 7), 827(3 to 7), 881(11 to 1), 884(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(764: 10.000000), (827: 0.000000), (881: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(762: 5), (764: 3), (783: 2), (786: 2), (787: 3), (827: 6), (881: 3), (884: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 86 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
