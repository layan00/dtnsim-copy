The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
755(7 to 5), 761(12 to 5), 780(8 to 4), 783(8 to 3), 784(10 to 7), 820(3 to 7), 878(11 to 1), 884(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(755: 20.000000), (761: 10.000000), (784: 50.000000), (820: 0.000000), (878: 20.000000), (884: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(755: 6), (761: 3), (780: 2), (783: 2), (784: 6), (820: 6), (878: 3), (884: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 49 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
