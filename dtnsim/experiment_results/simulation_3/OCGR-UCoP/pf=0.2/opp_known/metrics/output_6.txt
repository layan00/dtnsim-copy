The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
639(7 to 5), 645(12 to 5), 654(8 to 4), 657(8 to 3), 658(10 to 7), 684(3 to 7), 719(11 to 1), 726(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(639: 20.000000), (645: 10.000000), (657: 70.000000), (658: 10.000000), (684: 0.000000), (719: 20.000000), (726: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(639: 6), (645: 3), (654: 6), (657: 5), (658: 3), (684: 6), (719: 3), (726: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
