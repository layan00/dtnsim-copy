The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1755(7 to 5), 1758(12 to 5), 1768(8 to 4), 1771(8 to 3), 1772(10 to 7), 1800(3 to 7), 1833(11 to 1), 1840(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1755: 60.000000), (1758: 10.000000), (1771: 70.000000), (1772: 10.000000), (1800: 0.000000), (1833: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1755: 6), (1758: 3), (1768: 6), (1771: 5), (1772: 3), (1800: 6), (1833: 3), (1840: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
