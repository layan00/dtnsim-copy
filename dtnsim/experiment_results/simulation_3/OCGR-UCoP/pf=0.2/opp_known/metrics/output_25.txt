The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
257(7 to 5), 263(12 to 5), 273(8 to 4), 276(8 to 3), 277(10 to 7), 304(3 to 7), 337(11 to 1), 344(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(257: 20.000000), (263: 10.000000), (276: 70.000000), (277: 10.000000), (304: 0.000000), (337: 20.000000), (344: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(257: 6), (263: 3), (273: 6), (276: 5), (277: 3), (304: 6), (337: 3), (344: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
