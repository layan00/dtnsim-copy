The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1777(7 to 5), 1783(12 to 5), 1792(8 to 4), 1795(8 to 3), 1796(10 to 7), 1819(3 to 7), 1842(11 to 1), 1849(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1777: 20.000000), (1783: 10.000000), (1792: 120.000000), (1795: 70.000000), (1796: 10.000000), (1842: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1777: 6), (1783: 3), (1792: 6), (1795: 5), (1796: 3), (1819: 1), (1842: 3), (1849: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
