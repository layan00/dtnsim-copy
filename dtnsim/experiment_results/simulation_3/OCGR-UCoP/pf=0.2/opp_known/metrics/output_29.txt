The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1798(7 to 5), 1799(12 to 5), 1809(8 to 4), 1811(8 to 3), 1812(10 to 7), 1844(3 to 7), 1878(11 to 1), 1885(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1798: 60.000000), (1799: 10.000000), (1809: 120.000000), (1811: 70.000000), (1812: 10.000000), (1844: 0.000000), (1885: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1798: 6), (1799: 3), (1809: 6), (1811: 5), (1812: 3), (1844: 6), (1878: 3), (1885: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
