The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1810(7 to 5), 1816(12 to 5), 1826(8 to 4), 1829(8 to 3), 1830(10 to 7), 1858(3 to 7), 1891(11 to 1), 1898(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1810: 20.000000), (1816: 10.000000), (1826: 120.000000), (1829: 70.000000), (1830: 10.000000), (1858: 0.000000), (1891: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1810: 6), (1816: 3), (1826: 6), (1829: 5), (1830: 3), (1858: 6), (1891: 3), (1898: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
