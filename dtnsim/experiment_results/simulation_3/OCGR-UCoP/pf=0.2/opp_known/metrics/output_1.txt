The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
637(7 to 5), 640(12 to 5), 648(8 to 4), 650(8 to 3), 651(10 to 7), 676(3 to 7), 708(11 to 1), 711(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(637: 60.000000), (640: 50.000000), (650: 130.000000), (651: 10.000000), (676: 0.000000), (708: 20.000000), (711: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(637: 6), (640: 4), (648: 3), (650: 7), (651: 3), (676: 6), (708: 3), (711: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
