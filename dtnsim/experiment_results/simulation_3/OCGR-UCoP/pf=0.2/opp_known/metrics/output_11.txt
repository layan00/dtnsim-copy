The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
623(7 to 5), 625(12 to 5), 632(8 to 4), 634(8 to 3), 635(10 to 7), 658(3 to 7), 688(11 to 1), 691(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(623: 40.000000), (625: 50.000000), (635: 10.000000), (658: 0.000000), (688: 20.000000), (691: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(623: 6), (625: 4), (632: 2), (634: 2), (635: 3), (658: 6), (688: 3), (691: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
