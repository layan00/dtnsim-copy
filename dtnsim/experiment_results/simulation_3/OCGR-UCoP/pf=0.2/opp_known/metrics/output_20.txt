The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
261(7 to 5), 267(12 to 5), 275(8 to 4), 278(8 to 3), 279(10 to 7), 306(3 to 7), 340(11 to 1), 347(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 20.000000), (267: 10.000000), (279: 10.000000), (306: 0.000000), (347: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(261: 6), (267: 3), (275: 5), (278: 5), (279: 3), (306: 6), (340: 3), (347: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
