The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1199(7 to 5), 1201(12 to 5), 1218(8 to 4), 1221(8 to 3), 1222(10 to 7), 1254(3 to 7), 1297(11 to 1), 1300(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1201: 10.000000), (1218: 120.000000), (1221: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1199: 5), (1201: 3), (1218: 4), (1221: 3), (1222: 3), (1254: 1), (1297: 3), (1300: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
