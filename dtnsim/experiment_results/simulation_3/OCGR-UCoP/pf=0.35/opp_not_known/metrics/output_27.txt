The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1188(7 to 5), 1189(12 to 5), 1209(8 to 4), 1211(8 to 3), 1212(10 to 7), 1247(3 to 7), 1293(11 to 1), 1299(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1189: 10.000000), (1209: 120.000000), (1211: 90.000000), (1299: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1188: 5), (1189: 3), (1209: 4), (1211: 3), (1212: 6), (1247: 1), (1293: 3), (1299: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 98 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
