The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2114(7 to 5), 2115(12 to 5), 2133(8 to 4), 2135(8 to 3), 2136(10 to 7), 2176(3 to 7), 2221(11 to 1), 2224(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2115: 10.000000), (2224: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2114: 5), (2115: 3), (2133: 2), (2135: 2), (2136: 3), (2176: 1), (2221: 3), (2224: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 94 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
