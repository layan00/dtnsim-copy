The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2138(7 to 5), 2139(12 to 5), 2158(8 to 4), 2160(8 to 3), 2161(10 to 7), 2200(3 to 7), 2248(11 to 1), 2251(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2138: 60.000000), (2139: 10.000000), (2158: 120.000000), (2160: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2138: 6), (2139: 3), (2158: 3), (2160: 2), (2161: 3), (2200: 4), (2248: 3), (2251: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
