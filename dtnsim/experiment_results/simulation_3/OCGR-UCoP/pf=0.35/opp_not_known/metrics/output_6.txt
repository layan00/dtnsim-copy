The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
721(7 to 5), 727(12 to 5), 746(8 to 4), 749(8 to 3), 750(10 to 7), 785(3 to 7), 841(11 to 1), 844(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(721: 20.000000), (727: 10.000000), (785: 0.000000), (841: 20.000000), (844: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(721: 6), (727: 3), (746: 2), (749: 2), (750: 4), (785: 6), (841: 3), (844: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 56 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
