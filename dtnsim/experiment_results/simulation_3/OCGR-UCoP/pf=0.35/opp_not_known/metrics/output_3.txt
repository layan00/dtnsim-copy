The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1662(7 to 5), 1668(12 to 5), 1685(8 to 4), 1686(8 to 3), 1687(10 to 7), 1725(3 to 7), 1770(11 to 1), 1773(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1687: 10.000000), (1770: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1662: 7), (1668: 4), (1685: 2), (1686: 2), (1687: 6), (1725: 1), (1770: 3), (1773: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
