The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
699(7 to 5), 701(12 to 5), 718(8 to 4), 720(8 to 3), 721(10 to 7), 755(3 to 7), 798(11 to 1), 805(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(701: 10.000000), (721: 50.000000), (798: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(699: 2), (701: 3), (718: 2), (720: 2), (721: 6), (755: 1), (798: 3), (805: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 71 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
