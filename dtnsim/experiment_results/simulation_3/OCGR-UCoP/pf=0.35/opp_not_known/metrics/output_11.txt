The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
717(7 to 5), 719(12 to 5), 734(8 to 4), 735(8 to 3), 736(10 to 7), 769(3 to 7), 823(11 to 1), 826(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(719: 50.000000), (736: 10.000000), (769: 0.000000), (823: 20.000000), (826: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(717: 2), (719: 4), (734: 2), (735: 2), (736: 6), (769: 6), (823: 3), (826: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 72 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
