The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1655(7 to 5), 1658(12 to 5), 1673(8 to 4), 1675(8 to 3), 1676(10 to 7), 1709(3 to 7), 1759(11 to 1), 1765(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1658: 10.000000), (1759: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1655: 4), (1658: 3), (1673: 2), (1675: 2), (1676: 7), (1709: 4), (1759: 3), (1765: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 108 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
