The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2120(7 to 5), 2121(12 to 5), 2138(8 to 4), 2140(8 to 3), 2141(10 to 7), 2178(3 to 7), 2222(11 to 1), 2225(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2121: 10.000000), (2140: 90.000000), (2225: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2120: 5), (2121: 3), (2138: 3), (2140: 2), (2141: 3), (2178: 1), (2222: 3), (2225: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
