The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2123(7 to 5), 2129(12 to 5), 2148(8 to 4), 2151(8 to 3), 2152(10 to 7), 2186(3 to 7), 2229(11 to 1), 2235(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2123: 20.000000), (2129: 10.000000), (2148: 120.000000), (2151: 90.000000), (2229: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2123: 6), (2129: 3), (2148: 3), (2151: 2), (2152: 6), (2186: 1), (2229: 3), (2235: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 65 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
