The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1182(7 to 5), 1183(12 to 5), 1199(8 to 4), 1200(8 to 3), 1201(10 to 7), 1239(3 to 7), 1287(11 to 1), 1290(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1199: 120.000000), (1200: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1182: 6), (1183: 4), (1199: 4), (1200: 3), (1201: 4), (1239: 4), (1287: 3), (1290: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
