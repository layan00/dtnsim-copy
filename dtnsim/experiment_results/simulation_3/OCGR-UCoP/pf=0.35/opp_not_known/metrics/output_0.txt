The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
262(7 to 5), 268(12 to 5), 288(8 to 4), 291(8 to 3), 292(10 to 7), 327(3 to 7), 377(11 to 1), 384(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(262: 20.000000), (268: 10.000000), (288: 120.000000), (291: 90.000000), (292: 50.000000), (377: 20.000000), (384: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(262: 6), (268: 3), (288: 3), (291: 2), (292: 6), (327: 4), (377: 3), (384: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 66 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
