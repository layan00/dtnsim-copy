The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2128(7 to 5), 2129(12 to 5), 2146(8 to 4), 2148(8 to 3), 2149(10 to 7), 2189(3 to 7), 2236(11 to 1), 2242(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2129: 10.000000), (2236: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2128: 5), (2129: 3), (2146: 2), (2148: 2), (2149: 6), (2189: 1), (2236: 3), (2242: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
