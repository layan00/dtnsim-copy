The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1309(7 to 5), 1312(12 to 5), 1317(8 to 4), 1319(8 to 3), 1320(10 to 7), 1343(3 to 7), 1368(11 to 1), 1371(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1312: 10.000000), (1320: 10.000000), (1368: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1309: 4), (1312: 3), (1317: 2), (1319: 2), (1320: 3), (1343: 4), (1368: 3), (1371: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
