The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
242(7 to 5), 243(12 to 5), 250(8 to 4), 251(8 to 3), 252(10 to 7), 278(3 to 7), 310(11 to 1), 313(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 50.000000), (250: 120.000000), (251: 90.000000), (252: 10.000000), (278: 0.000000), (310: 20.000000), (313: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(242: 4), (243: 4), (250: 4), (251: 3), (252: 3), (278: 6), (310: 3), (313: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
