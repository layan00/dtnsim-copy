The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
249(7 to 5), 255(12 to 5), 265(8 to 4), 268(8 to 3), 269(10 to 7), 293(3 to 7), 323(11 to 1), 330(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(249: 20.000000), (255: 10.000000), (268: 70.000000), (269: 10.000000), (293: 0.000000), (323: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(249: 6), (255: 3), (265: 6), (268: 5), (269: 3), (293: 6), (323: 3), (330: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
