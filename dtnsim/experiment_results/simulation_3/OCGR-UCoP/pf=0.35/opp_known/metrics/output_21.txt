The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
606(7 to 5), 608(12 to 5), 614(8 to 4), 616(8 to 3), 617(10 to 7), 647(3 to 7), 679(11 to 1), 686(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(608: 50.000000), (616: 70.000000), (617: 10.000000), (647: 0.000000), (686: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(606: 6), (608: 4), (614: 6), (616: 5), (617: 6), (647: 6), (679: 3), (686: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
