The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
977(7 to 5), 978(12 to 5), 988(8 to 4), 990(8 to 3), 991(10 to 7), 1015(3 to 7), 1037(11 to 1), 1040(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(978: 10.000000), (988: 120.000000), (990: 90.000000), (991: 10.000000), (1040: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(977: 5), (978: 3), (988: 4), (990: 3), (991: 3), (1015: 1), (1037: 3), (1040: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
