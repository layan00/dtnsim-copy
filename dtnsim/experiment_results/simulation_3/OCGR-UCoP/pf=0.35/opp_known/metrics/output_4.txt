The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1683(7 to 5), 1689(12 to 5), 1698(8 to 4), 1701(8 to 3), 1702(10 to 7), 1725(3 to 7), 1746(11 to 1), 1753(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1683: 20.000000), (1689: 10.000000), (1698: 120.000000), (1701: 70.000000), (1702: 10.000000), (1746: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1683: 6), (1689: 3), (1698: 6), (1701: 5), (1702: 3), (1725: 1), (1746: 3), (1753: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
