The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1332(7 to 5), 1338(12 to 5), 1343(8 to 4), 1344(8 to 3), 1345(10 to 7), 1370(3 to 7), 1398(11 to 1), 1401(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1344: 90.000000), (1345: 10.000000), (1370: 0.000000), (1398: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1332: 7), (1338: 4), (1343: 4), (1344: 3), (1345: 6), (1370: 6), (1398: 3), (1401: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
