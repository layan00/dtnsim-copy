The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
950(7 to 5), 951(12 to 5), 957(8 to 4), 959(8 to 3), 960(10 to 7), 987(3 to 7), 1011(11 to 1), 1014(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(951: 10.000000), (959: 130.000000), (960: 10.000000), (1011: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(950: 5), (951: 3), (957: 3), (959: 7), (960: 6), (987: 1), (1011: 3), (1014: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
