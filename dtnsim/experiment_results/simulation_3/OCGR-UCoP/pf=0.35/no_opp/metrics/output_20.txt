The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
119(7 to 5), 122(12 to 5), 127(8 to 4), 129(8 to 3), 130(10 to 7), 144(3 to 7), 160(11 to 1), 164(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(119: 60.000000), (122: 50.000000), (160: 80.000000), (164: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(119: 5), (122: 5), (127: 2), (129: 2), (130: 5), (144: 3), (160: 3), (164: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
