The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
800(7 to 5), 801(12 to 5), 809(8 to 4), 811(8 to 3), 812(10 to 7), 824(3 to 7), 833(11 to 1), 835(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(801: 50.000000), (809: 120.000000), (811: 90.000000), (833: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(800: 1), (801: 4), (809: 3), (811: 2), (812: 3), (824: 1), (833: 3), (835: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
