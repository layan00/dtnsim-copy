The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
781(7 to 5), 782(12 to 5), 788(8 to 4), 789(8 to 3), 790(10 to 7), 805(3 to 7), 815(11 to 1), 818(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(805: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(781: 1), (782: 4), (788: 2), (789: 2), (790: 3), (805: 3), (815: 2), (818: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
