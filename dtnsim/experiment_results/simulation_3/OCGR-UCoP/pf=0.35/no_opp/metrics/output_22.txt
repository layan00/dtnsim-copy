The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
450(7 to 5), 451(12 to 5), 456(8 to 4), 458(8 to 3), 459(10 to 7), 470(3 to 7), 480(11 to 1), 482(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(456: 120.000000), (458: 90.000000), (480: 80.000000), (482: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(450: 1), (451: 4), (456: 4), (458: 3), (459: 4), (470: 2), (480: 3), (482: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
