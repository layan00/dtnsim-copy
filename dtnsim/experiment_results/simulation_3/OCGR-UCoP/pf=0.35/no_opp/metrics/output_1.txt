The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
308(7 to 5), 311(12 to 5), 317(8 to 4), 320(8 to 3), 321(10 to 7), 331(3 to 7), 342(11 to 1), 346(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(321: 70.000000), (331: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(308: 4), (311: 3), (317: 3), (320: 3), (321: 5), (331: 3), (342: 2), (346: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
