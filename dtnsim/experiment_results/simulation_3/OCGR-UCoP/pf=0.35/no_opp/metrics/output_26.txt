The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
288(7 to 5), 290(12 to 5), 297(8 to 4), 299(8 to 3), 300(10 to 7), 314(3 to 7), 325(11 to 1), 326(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(290: 50.000000), (297: 120.000000), (299: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(288: 2), (290: 4), (297: 3), (299: 2), (300: 4), (314: 2), (325: 1), (326: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
