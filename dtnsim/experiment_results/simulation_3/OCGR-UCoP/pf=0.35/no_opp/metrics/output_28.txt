The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
628(7 to 5), 631(12 to 5), 637(8 to 4), 638(8 to 3), 639(10 to 7), 650(3 to 7), 662(11 to 1), 666(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(639: 70.000000), (650: 55.000000), (662: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(628: 3), (631: 2), (637: 2), (638: 2), (639: 5), (650: 3), (662: 3), (666: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
