The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
264(7 to 5), 266(12 to 5), 271(8 to 4), 272(8 to 3), 273(10 to 7), 283(3 to 7), 291(11 to 1), 294(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(273: 70.000000), (283: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(264: 2), (266: 2), (271: 2), (272: 2), (273: 4), (283: 3), (291: 1), (294: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
