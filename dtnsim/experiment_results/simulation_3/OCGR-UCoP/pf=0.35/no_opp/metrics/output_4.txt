The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
792(7 to 5), 795(12 to 5), 802(8 to 4), 804(8 to 3), 805(10 to 7), 817(3 to 7), 825(11 to 1), 828(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(802: 120.000000), (804: 90.000000), (805: 70.000000), (817: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(792: 4), (795: 4), (802: 3), (804: 2), (805: 4), (817: 3), (825: 1), (828: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
