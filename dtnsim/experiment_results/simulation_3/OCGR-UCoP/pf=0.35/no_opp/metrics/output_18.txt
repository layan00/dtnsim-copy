The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
579(7 to 5), 580(12 to 5), 588(8 to 4), 589(8 to 3), 590(10 to 7), 603(3 to 7), 614(11 to 1), 618(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(590: 70.000000), (603: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(579: 1), (580: 2), (588: 2), (589: 2), (590: 4), (603: 3), (614: 2), (618: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
