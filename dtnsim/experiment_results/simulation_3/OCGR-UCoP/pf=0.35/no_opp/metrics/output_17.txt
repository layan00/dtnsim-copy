The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
418(7 to 5), 419(12 to 5), 425(8 to 4), 426(8 to 3), 427(10 to 7), 437(3 to 7), 448(11 to 1), 451(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(427: 70.000000), (437: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(418: 1), (419: 2), (425: 2), (426: 2), (427: 4), (437: 3), (448: 1), (451: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
