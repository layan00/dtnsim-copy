The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
110(7 to 5), 111(12 to 5), 116(8 to 4), 117(8 to 3), 118(10 to 7), 128(3 to 7), 143(11 to 1), 146(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(116: 120.000000), (117: 90.000000), (143: 80.000000), (146: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(110: 1), (111: 3), (116: 3), (117: 2), (118: 6), (128: 1), (143: 3), (146: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
