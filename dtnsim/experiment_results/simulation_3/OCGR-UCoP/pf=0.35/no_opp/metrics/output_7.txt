The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
454(7 to 5), 456(12 to 5), 462(8 to 4), 463(8 to 3), 464(10 to 7), 470(3 to 7), 478(11 to 1), 480(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(462: 120.000000), (463: 90.000000), (478: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(454: 2), (456: 2), (462: 4), (463: 3), (464: 3), (470: 2), (478: 3), (480: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
