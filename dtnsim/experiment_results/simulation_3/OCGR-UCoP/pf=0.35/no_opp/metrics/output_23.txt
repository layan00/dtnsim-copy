The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
624(7 to 5), 627(12 to 5), 631(8 to 4), 634(8 to 3), 635(10 to 7), 647(3 to 7), 658(11 to 1), 662(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(634: 90.000000), (635: 70.000000), (647: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(624: 5), (627: 4), (631: 4), (634: 3), (635: 5), (647: 3), (658: 2), (662: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
