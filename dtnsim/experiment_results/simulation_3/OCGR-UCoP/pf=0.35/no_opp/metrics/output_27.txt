The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
452(7 to 5), 453(12 to 5), 461(8 to 4), 462(8 to 3), 463(10 to 7), 471(3 to 7), 482(11 to 1), 486(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(461: 120.000000), (462: 90.000000), (482: 80.000000), (486: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(452: 1), (453: 2), (461: 4), (462: 3), (463: 4), (471: 3), (482: 3), (486: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
