The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
617(7 to 5), 620(12 to 5), 624(8 to 4), 625(8 to 3), 626(10 to 7), 635(3 to 7), 647(11 to 1), 651(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(647: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(617: 3), (620: 2), (624: 2), (625: 2), (626: 5), (635: 3), (647: 3), (651: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
