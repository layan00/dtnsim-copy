The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
469(7 to 5), 470(12 to 5), 475(8 to 4), 476(8 to 3), 477(10 to 7), 483(3 to 7), 493(11 to 1), 495(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(475: 120.000000), (476: 90.000000), (493: 80.000000), (495: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(469: 1), (470: 2), (475: 4), (476: 3), (477: 3), (483: 1), (493: 3), (495: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
