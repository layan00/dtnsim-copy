The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
769(7 to 5), 770(12 to 5), 775(8 to 4), 776(8 to 3), 777(10 to 7), 787(3 to 7), 796(11 to 1), 798(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(776: 90.000000), (798: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(769: 1), (770: 2), (775: 3), (776: 2), (777: 3), (787: 2), (796: 2), (798: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
