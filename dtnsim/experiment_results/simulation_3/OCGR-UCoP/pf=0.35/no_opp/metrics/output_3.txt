The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
627(7 to 5), 630(12 to 5), 635(8 to 4), 636(8 to 3), 637(10 to 7), 648(3 to 7), 658(11 to 1), 661(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(648: 55.000000), (658: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(627: 3), (630: 4), (635: 2), (636: 2), (637: 3), (648: 3), (658: 3), (661: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
