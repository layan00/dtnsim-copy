The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
745(7 to 5), 747(12 to 5), 753(8 to 4), 754(8 to 3), 755(10 to 7), 765(3 to 7), 780(11 to 1), 784(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(754: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(745: 2), (747: 2), (753: 3), (754: 2), (755: 5), (765: 3), (780: 2), (784: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
