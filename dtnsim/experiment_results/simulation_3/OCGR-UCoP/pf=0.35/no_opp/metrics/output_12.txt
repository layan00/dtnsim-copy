The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
431(7 to 5), 432(12 to 5), 436(8 to 4), 437(8 to 3), 438(10 to 7), 448(3 to 7), 462(11 to 1), 466(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(462: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(431: 1), (432: 4), (436: 3), (437: 3), (438: 5), (448: 3), (462: 3), (466: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
