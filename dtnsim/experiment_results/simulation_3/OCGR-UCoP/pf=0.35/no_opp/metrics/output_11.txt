The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
275(7 to 5), 277(12 to 5), 281(8 to 4), 282(8 to 3), 283(10 to 7), 287(3 to 7), 299(11 to 1), 301(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(299: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(275: 2), (277: 2), (281: 2), (282: 2), (283: 4), (287: 1), (299: 3), (301: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
