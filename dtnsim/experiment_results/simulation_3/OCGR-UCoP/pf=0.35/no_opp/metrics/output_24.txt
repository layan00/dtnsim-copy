The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
802(7 to 5), 803(12 to 5), 809(8 to 4), 810(8 to 3), 811(10 to 7), 824(3 to 7), 836(11 to 1), 840(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(811: 70.000000), (824: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(802: 1), (803: 2), (809: 2), (810: 2), (811: 4), (824: 3), (836: 2), (840: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
