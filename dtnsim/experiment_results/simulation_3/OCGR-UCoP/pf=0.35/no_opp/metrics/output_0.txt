The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
126(7 to 5), 129(12 to 5), 138(8 to 4), 141(8 to 3), 142(10 to 7), 155(3 to 7), 167(11 to 1), 171(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(138: 120.000000), (141: 90.000000), (167: 80.000000), (171: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(126: 5), (129: 4), (138: 3), (141: 2), (142: 4), (155: 3), (167: 3), (171: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 61 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
