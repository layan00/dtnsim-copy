The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1480(7 to 5), 1482(12 to 5), 1497(8 to 4), 1498(8 to 3), 1499(10 to 7), 1526(3 to 7), 1568(11 to 1), 1571(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1568: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1480: 2), (1482: 4), (1497: 2), (1498: 2), (1499: 3), (1526: 2), (1568: 3), (1571: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 96 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
