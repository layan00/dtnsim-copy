The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1893(7 to 5), 1899(12 to 5), 1917(8 to 4), 1920(8 to 3), 1921(10 to 7), 1952(3 to 7), 1992(11 to 1), 1995(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1893: 20.000000), (1899: 10.000000), (1917: 120.000000), (1920: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1893: 6), (1899: 3), (1917: 3), (1920: 2), (1921: 3), (1952: 1), (1992: 3), (1995: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 63 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
