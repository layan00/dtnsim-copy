The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1889(7 to 5), 1890(12 to 5), 1906(8 to 4), 1908(8 to 3), 1909(10 to 7), 1943(3 to 7), 1986(11 to 1), 1989(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1890: 10.000000), (1908: 90.000000), (1986: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1889: 4), (1890: 3), (1906: 3), (1908: 2), (1909: 4), (1943: 2), (1986: 3), (1989: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 70 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
