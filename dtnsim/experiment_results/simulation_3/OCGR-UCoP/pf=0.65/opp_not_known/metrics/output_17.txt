The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1054(7 to 5), 1055(12 to 5), 1070(8 to 4), 1071(8 to 3), 1072(10 to 7), 1101(3 to 7), 1143(11 to 1), 1146(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1054: 4), (1055: 4), (1070: 2), (1071: 2), (1072: 3), (1101: 1), (1143: 3), (1146: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
