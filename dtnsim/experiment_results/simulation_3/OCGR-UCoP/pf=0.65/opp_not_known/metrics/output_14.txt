The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1925(7 to 5), 1926(12 to 5), 1942(8 to 4), 1943(8 to 3), 1944(10 to 7), 1977(3 to 7), 2021(11 to 1), 2024(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1925: 4), (1926: 4), (1942: 2), (1943: 2), (1944: 3), (1977: 2), (2021: 3), (2024: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 124 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
