The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(7 to 5), 229(12 to 5), 247(8 to 4), 249(8 to 3), 250(10 to 7), 278(3 to 7), 323(11 to 1), 326(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 50.000000), (323: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 5), (229: 4), (247: 2), (249: 2), (250: 5), (278: 1), (323: 3), (326: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 87 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
