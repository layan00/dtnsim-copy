The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1469(7 to 5), 1470(12 to 5), 1488(8 to 4), 1490(8 to 3), 1491(10 to 7), 1529(3 to 7), 1572(11 to 1), 1575(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1470: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1469: 6), (1470: 3), (1488: 2), (1490: 2), (1491: 3), (1529: 4), (1572: 3), (1575: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 107 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
