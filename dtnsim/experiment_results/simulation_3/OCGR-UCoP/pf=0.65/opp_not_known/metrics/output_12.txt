The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1075(7 to 5), 1076(12 to 5), 1091(8 to 4), 1093(8 to 3), 1094(10 to 7), 1126(3 to 7), 1170(11 to 1), 1173(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1076: 10.000000), (1170: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1075: 4), (1076: 3), (1091: 2), (1093: 2), (1094: 3), (1126: 1), (1170: 3), (1173: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 78 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
