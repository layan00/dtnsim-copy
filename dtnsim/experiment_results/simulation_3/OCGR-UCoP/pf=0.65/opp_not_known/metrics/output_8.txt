The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1491(7 to 5), 1492(12 to 5), 1505(8 to 4), 1506(8 to 3), 1507(10 to 7), 1541(3 to 7), 1585(11 to 1), 1588(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1492: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1491: 5), (1492: 4), (1505: 2), (1506: 2), (1507: 4), (1541: 1), (1585: 3), (1588: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
