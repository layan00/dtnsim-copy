The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1076(7 to 5), 1078(12 to 5), 1094(8 to 4), 1095(8 to 3), 1096(10 to 7), 1123(3 to 7), 1166(11 to 1), 1169(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1094: 120.000000), (1095: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1076: 2), (1078: 4), (1094: 4), (1095: 3), (1096: 3), (1123: 2), (1166: 3), (1169: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
