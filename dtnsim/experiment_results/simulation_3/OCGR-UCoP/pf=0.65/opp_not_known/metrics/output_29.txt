The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1910(7 to 5), 1911(12 to 5), 1928(8 to 4), 1930(8 to 3), 1931(10 to 7), 1967(3 to 7), 2011(11 to 1), 2014(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1910: 60.000000), (1911: 10.000000), (1928: 120.000000), (1930: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1910: 6), (1911: 3), (1928: 3), (1930: 2), (1931: 3), (1967: 4), (2011: 3), (2014: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 83 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
