The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
665(7 to 5), 667(12 to 5), 683(8 to 4), 684(8 to 3), 685(10 to 7), 717(3 to 7), 765(11 to 1), 768(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(667: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(665: 2), (667: 4), (683: 2), (684: 2), (685: 4), (717: 4), (765: 3), (768: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 98 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
