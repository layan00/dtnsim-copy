The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1955(7 to 5), 1956(12 to 5), 1971(8 to 4), 1973(8 to 3), 1974(10 to 7), 2009(3 to 7), 2052(11 to 1), 2055(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1956: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1955: 4), (1956: 3), (1971: 2), (1973: 2), (1974: 3), (2009: 2), (2052: 3), (2055: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 95 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
