The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1481(7 to 5), 1482(12 to 5), 1498(8 to 4), 1499(8 to 3), 1500(10 to 7), 1532(3 to 7), 1575(11 to 1), 1578(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1481: 4), (1482: 4), (1498: 2), (1499: 2), (1500: 3), (1532: 1), (1575: 3), (1578: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 134 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
