The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1072(7 to 5), 1073(12 to 5), 1086(8 to 4), 1087(8 to 3), 1088(10 to 7), 1116(3 to 7), 1160(11 to 1), 1163(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1073: 50.000000), (1087: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1072: 4), (1073: 4), (1086: 4), (1087: 3), (1088: 4), (1116: 1), (1160: 3), (1163: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 84 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
