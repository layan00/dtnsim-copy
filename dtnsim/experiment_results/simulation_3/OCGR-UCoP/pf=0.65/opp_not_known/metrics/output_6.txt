The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(7 to 5), 657(12 to 5), 672(8 to 4), 674(8 to 3), 675(10 to 7), 710(3 to 7), 754(11 to 1), 757(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(675: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 4), (657: 4), (672: 2), (674: 2), (675: 6), (710: 1), (754: 3), (757: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
