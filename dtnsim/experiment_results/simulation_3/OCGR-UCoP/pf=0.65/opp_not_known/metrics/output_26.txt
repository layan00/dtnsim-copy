The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
632(7 to 5), 634(12 to 5), 651(8 to 4), 653(8 to 3), 654(10 to 7), 689(3 to 7), 731(11 to 1), 734(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(634: 50.000000), (654: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(632: 5), (634: 4), (651: 3), (653: 3), (654: 6), (689: 1), (731: 3), (734: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 111 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
