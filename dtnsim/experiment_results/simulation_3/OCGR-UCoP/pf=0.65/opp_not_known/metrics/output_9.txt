The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1906(7 to 5), 1907(12 to 5), 1923(8 to 4), 1924(8 to 3), 1925(10 to 7), 1960(3 to 7), 2000(11 to 1), 2003(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1906: 5), (1907: 4), (1923: 2), (1924: 2), (1925: 3), (1960: 1), (2000: 3), (2003: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 118 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
