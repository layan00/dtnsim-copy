The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1056(7 to 5), 1057(12 to 5), 1074(8 to 4), 1076(8 to 3), 1077(10 to 7), 1109(3 to 7), 1152(11 to 1), 1155(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1057: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1056: 5), (1057: 3), (1074: 3), (1076: 3), (1077: 3), (1109: 1), (1152: 3), (1155: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 77 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
