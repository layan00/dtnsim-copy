The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1094(7 to 5), 1095(12 to 5), 1109(8 to 4), 1110(8 to 3), 1111(10 to 7), 1147(3 to 7), 1192(11 to 1), 1195(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1094: 6), (1095: 4), (1109: 3), (1110: 3), (1111: 4), (1147: 4), (1192: 3), (1195: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 143 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
