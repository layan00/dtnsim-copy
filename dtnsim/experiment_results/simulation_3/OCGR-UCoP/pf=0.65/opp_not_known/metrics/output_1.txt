The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
663(7 to 5), 665(12 to 5), 680(8 to 4), 681(8 to 3), 682(10 to 7), 716(3 to 7), 759(11 to 1), 762(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(682: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(663: 2), (665: 4), (680: 3), (681: 3), (682: 6), (716: 1), (759: 3), (762: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 115 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
