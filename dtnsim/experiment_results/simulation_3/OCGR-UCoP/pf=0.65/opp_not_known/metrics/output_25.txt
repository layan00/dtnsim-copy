The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
219(7 to 5), 222(12 to 5), 237(8 to 4), 240(8 to 3), 241(10 to 7), 273(3 to 7), 312(11 to 1), 315(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(222: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(219: 4), (222: 3), (237: 3), (240: 2), (241: 3), (273: 1), (312: 3), (315: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 51 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
