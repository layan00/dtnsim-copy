The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
651(7 to 5), 653(12 to 5), 667(8 to 4), 668(8 to 3), 669(10 to 7), 700(3 to 7), 745(11 to 1), 748(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(653: 50.000000), (669: 10.000000), (745: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(651: 2), (653: 4), (667: 2), (668: 2), (669: 6), (700: 1), (745: 3), (748: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 59 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
