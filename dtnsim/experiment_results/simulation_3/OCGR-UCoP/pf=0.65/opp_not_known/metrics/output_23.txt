The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1526(7 to 5), 1528(12 to 5), 1543(8 to 4), 1545(8 to 3), 1546(10 to 7), 1579(3 to 7), 1623(11 to 1), 1632(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1623: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1526: 5), (1528: 4), (1543: 2), (1545: 2), (1546: 7), (1579: 5), (1623: 3), (1632: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 109 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
