The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
530(7 to 5), 533(12 to 5), 538(8 to 4), 540(8 to 3), 541(10 to 7), 564(3 to 7), 584(11 to 1), 587(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(541: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(530: 5), (533: 4), (538: 3), (540: 4), (541: 6), (564: 1), (584: 3), (587: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
