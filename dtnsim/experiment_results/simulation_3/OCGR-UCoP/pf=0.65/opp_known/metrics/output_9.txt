The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1457(7 to 5), 1458(12 to 5), 1464(8 to 4), 1465(8 to 3), 1466(10 to 7), 1491(3 to 7), 1507(11 to 1), 1510(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1457: 5), (1458: 4), (1464: 3), (1465: 7), (1466: 4), (1491: 1), (1507: 3), (1510: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
