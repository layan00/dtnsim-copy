The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
233(7 to 5), 235(12 to 5), 239(8 to 4), 240(8 to 3), 241(10 to 7), 262(3 to 7), 284(11 to 1), 287(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(233: 3), (235: 4), (239: 2), (240: 2), (241: 4), (262: 1), (284: 3), (287: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
