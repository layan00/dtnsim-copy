The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
858(7 to 5), 859(12 to 5), 862(8 to 4), 863(8 to 3), 864(10 to 7), 882(3 to 7), 901(11 to 1), 904(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(859: 50.000000), (863: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(858: 4), (859: 4), (862: 4), (863: 3), (864: 4), (882: 1), (901: 3), (904: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
