The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1156(7 to 5), 1157(12 to 5), 1163(8 to 4), 1164(8 to 3), 1165(10 to 7), 1186(3 to 7), 1208(11 to 1), 1211(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1156: 4), (1157: 4), (1163: 2), (1164: 2), (1165: 4), (1186: 4), (1208: 3), (1211: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
