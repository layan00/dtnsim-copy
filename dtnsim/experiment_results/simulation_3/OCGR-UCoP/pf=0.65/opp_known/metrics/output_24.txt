The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1511(7 to 5), 1512(12 to 5), 1517(8 to 4), 1519(8 to 3), 1520(10 to 7), 1547(3 to 7), 1567(11 to 1), 1574(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1512: 10.000000), (1520: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1511: 4), (1512: 3), (1517: 5), (1519: 5), (1520: 6), (1547: 1), (1567: 3), (1574: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
