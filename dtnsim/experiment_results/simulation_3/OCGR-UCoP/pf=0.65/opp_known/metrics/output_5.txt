The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(7 to 5), 223(12 to 5), 228(8 to 4), 230(8 to 3), 231(10 to 7), 251(3 to 7), 270(11 to 1), 273(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 4), (223: 3), (228: 2), (230: 2), (231: 4), (251: 1), (270: 3), (273: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
