The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
842(7 to 5), 844(12 to 5), 850(8 to 4), 852(8 to 3), 853(10 to 7), 873(3 to 7), 891(11 to 1), 894(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(850: 120.000000), (852: 90.000000), (853: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(842: 6), (844: 4), (850: 4), (852: 3), (853: 3), (873: 1), (891: 3), (894: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
