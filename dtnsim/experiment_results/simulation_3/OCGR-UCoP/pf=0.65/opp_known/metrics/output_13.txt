The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1173(7 to 5), 1174(12 to 5), 1178(8 to 4), 1179(8 to 3), 1180(10 to 7), 1200(3 to 7), 1227(11 to 1), 1230(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1230: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1173: 4), (1174: 4), (1178: 2), (1179: 2), (1180: 4), (1200: 4), (1227: 3), (1230: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
