The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(7 to 5), 225(12 to 5), 229(8 to 4), 230(8 to 3), 231(10 to 7), 256(3 to 7), 277(11 to 1), 280(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 50.000000), (231: 10.000000), (277: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 4), (225: 4), (229: 3), (230: 4), (231: 3), (256: 4), (277: 3), (280: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
