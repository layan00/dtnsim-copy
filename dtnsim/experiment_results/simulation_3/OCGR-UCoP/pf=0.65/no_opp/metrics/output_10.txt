The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
92(7 to 5), 93(12 to 5), 95(8 to 4), 96(8 to 3), 97(10 to 7), 105(3 to 7), 111(11 to 1), 113(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(111: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(92: 1), (93: 2), (95: 2), (96: 2), (97: 4), (105: 1), (111: 3), (113: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
