The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(7 to 5), 239(12 to 5), 243(8 to 4), 244(8 to 3), 245(10 to 7), 252(3 to 7), 260(11 to 1), 261(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 2), (239: 2), (243: 2), (244: 2), (245: 3), (252: 1), (260: 1), (261: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
