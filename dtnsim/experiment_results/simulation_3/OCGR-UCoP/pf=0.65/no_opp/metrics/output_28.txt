The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
458(7 to 5), 459(12 to 5), 463(8 to 4), 464(8 to 3), 465(10 to 7), 471(3 to 7), 478(11 to 1), 479(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(458: 1), (459: 2), (463: 2), (464: 2), (465: 3), (471: 1), (478: 1), (479: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
