The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(7 to 5), 219(12 to 5), 222(8 to 4), 224(8 to 3), 225(10 to 7), 232(3 to 7), 240(11 to 1), 242(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 4), (219: 3), (222: 2), (224: 2), (225: 3), (232: 1), (240: 2), (242: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
