The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
586(7 to 5), 587(12 to 5), 591(8 to 4), 592(8 to 3), 593(10 to 7), 601(3 to 7), 605(11 to 1), 607(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(586: 1), (587: 2), (591: 2), (592: 2), (593: 3), (601: 1), (605: 2), (607: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
