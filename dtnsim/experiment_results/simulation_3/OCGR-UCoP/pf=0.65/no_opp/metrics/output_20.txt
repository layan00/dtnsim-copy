The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
101(7 to 5), 103(12 to 5), 105(8 to 4), 106(8 to 3), 107(10 to 7), 116(3 to 7), 126(11 to 1), 129(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(129: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(101: 2), (103: 2), (105: 2), (106: 2), (107: 5), (116: 3), (126: 1), (129: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 101: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
