The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
572(7 to 5), 575(12 to 5), 581(8 to 4), 583(8 to 3), 584(10 to 7), 591(3 to 7), 595(11 to 1), 596(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(581: 120.000000), (583: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 4), (575: 2), (581: 3), (583: 2), (584: 3), (591: 1), (595: 1), (596: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
