The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(7 to 5), 205(12 to 5), 211(8 to 4), 213(8 to 3), 214(10 to 7), 218(3 to 7), 224(11 to 1), 225(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 2), (205: 3), (211: 3), (213: 3), (214: 4), (218: 1), (224: 1), (225: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
