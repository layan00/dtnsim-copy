The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
607(7 to 5), 608(12 to 5), 612(8 to 4), 613(8 to 3), 614(10 to 7), 621(3 to 7), 629(11 to 1), 631(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(607: 1), (608: 2), (612: 2), (613: 2), (614: 3), (621: 2), (629: 2), (631: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 631: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 612: (to: 3, time: 120.000000),
