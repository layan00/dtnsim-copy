The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
566(7 to 5), 567(12 to 5), 571(8 to 4), 572(8 to 3), 573(10 to 7), 581(3 to 7), 588(11 to 1), 589(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(572: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(566: 1), (567: 2), (571: 3), (572: 2), (573: 4), (581: 2), (588: 1), (589: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
