The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
464(7 to 5), 465(12 to 5), 467(8 to 4), 468(8 to 3), 469(10 to 7), 476(3 to 7), 484(11 to 1), 488(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(464: 1), (465: 2), (467: 2), (468: 2), (469: 5), (476: 3), (484: 2), (488: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
