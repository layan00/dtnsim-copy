The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
367(7 to 5), 368(12 to 5), 371(8 to 4), 373(8 to 3), 374(10 to 7), 381(3 to 7), 387(11 to 1), 388(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(367: 1), (368: 4), (371: 3), (373: 3), (374: 3), (381: 1), (387: 1), (388: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
