The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
453(7 to 5), 455(12 to 5), 458(8 to 4), 459(8 to 3), 460(10 to 7), 463(3 to 7), 469(11 to 1), 471(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(453: 2), (455: 2), (458: 2), (459: 2), (460: 3), (463: 2), (469: 2), (471: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
