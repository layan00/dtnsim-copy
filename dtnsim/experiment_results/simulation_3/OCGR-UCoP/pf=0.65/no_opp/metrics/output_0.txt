The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
94(7 to 5), 95(12 to 5), 98(8 to 4), 99(8 to 3), 100(10 to 7), 108(3 to 7), 115(11 to 1), 117(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(99: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(94: 1), (95: 2), (98: 3), (99: 2), (100: 3), (108: 2), (115: 2), (117: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 51 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 117: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
