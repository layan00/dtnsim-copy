The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
341(7 to 5), 343(12 to 5), 347(8 to 4), 348(8 to 3), 349(10 to 7), 352(3 to 7), 359(11 to 1), 361(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(347: 120.000000), (348: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(341: 2), (343: 2), (347: 4), (348: 3), (349: 3), (352: 2), (359: 3), (361: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
