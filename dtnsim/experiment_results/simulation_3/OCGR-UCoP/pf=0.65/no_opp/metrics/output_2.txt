The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
342(7 to 5), 343(12 to 5), 344(8 to 4), 345(8 to 3), 346(10 to 7), 348(3 to 7), 355(11 to 1), 356(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(345: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(342: 1), (343: 2), (344: 4), (345: 3), (346: 4), (348: 1), (355: 1), (356: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 356: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
