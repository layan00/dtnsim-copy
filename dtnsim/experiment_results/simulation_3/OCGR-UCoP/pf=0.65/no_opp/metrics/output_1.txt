The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
226(7 to 5), 228(12 to 5), 232(8 to 4), 234(8 to 3), 235(10 to 7), 242(3 to 7), 250(11 to 1), 251(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(226: 2), (228: 3), (232: 3), (234: 3), (235: 4), (242: 2), (250: 1), (251: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
