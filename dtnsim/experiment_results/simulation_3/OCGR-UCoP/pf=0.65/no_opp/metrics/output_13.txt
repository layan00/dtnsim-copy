The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
479(7 to 5), 480(12 to 5), 482(8 to 4), 483(8 to 3), 484(10 to 7), 488(3 to 7), 500(11 to 1), 502(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(502: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(479: 1), (480: 2), (482: 2), (483: 2), (484: 3), (488: 1), (500: 3), (502: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 502: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
