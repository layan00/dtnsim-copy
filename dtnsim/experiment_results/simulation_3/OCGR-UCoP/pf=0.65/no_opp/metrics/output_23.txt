The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
500(7 to 5), 502(12 to 5), 506(8 to 4), 508(8 to 3), 509(10 to 7), 516(3 to 7), 524(11 to 1), 527(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(500: 2), (502: 3), (506: 2), (508: 2), (509: 5), (516: 3), (524: 1), (527: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
