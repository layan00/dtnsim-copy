The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
327(7 to 5), 328(12 to 5), 333(8 to 4), 334(8 to 3), 335(10 to 7), 340(3 to 7), 348(11 to 1), 351(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(327: 1), (328: 2), (333: 3), (334: 3), (335: 3), (340: 3), (348: 3), (351: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
