The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
174(1 to 11), 178(3 to 10), 179(4 to 6), 180(7 to 9), 185(12 to 4), 186(12 to 5), 195(8 to 1), 204(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(174: 3), (178: 4), (179: 1), (180: 2), (185: 4), (186: 4), (195: 1), (204: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
