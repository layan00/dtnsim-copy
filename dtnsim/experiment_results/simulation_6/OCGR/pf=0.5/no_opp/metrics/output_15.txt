The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(1 to 11), 75(3 to 10), 76(4 to 6), 77(7 to 9), 81(12 to 4), 82(12 to 5), 89(8 to 1), 92(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(70: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 4), (75: 3), (76: 1), (77: 3), (81: 5), (82: 1), (89: 1), (92: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
