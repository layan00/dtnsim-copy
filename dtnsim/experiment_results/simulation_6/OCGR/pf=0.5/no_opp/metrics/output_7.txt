The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
281(1 to 11), 282(3 to 10), 283(4 to 6), 284(7 to 9), 288(12 to 4), 289(12 to 5), 293(8 to 1), 300(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(300: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(281: 1), (282: 2), (283: 2), (284: 2), (288: 3), (289: 1), (293: 3), (300: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 281: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 282: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000),

Bundle 293: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 284: (to: 11, time: 20.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 300: (to: 3, time: 60.000000), 
Node 8:
