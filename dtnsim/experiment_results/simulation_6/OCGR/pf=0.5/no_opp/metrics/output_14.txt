The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
511(1 to 11), 516(3 to 10), 517(4 to 6), 518(7 to 9), 523(12 to 4), 524(12 to 5), 529(8 to 1), 533(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(511: 2), (516: 3), (517: 1), (518: 3), (523: 3), (524: 1), (529: 1), (533: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
