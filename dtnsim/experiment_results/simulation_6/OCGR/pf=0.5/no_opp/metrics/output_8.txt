The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
381(1 to 11), 385(3 to 10), 386(4 to 6), 387(7 to 9), 389(12 to 4), 390(12 to 5), 397(8 to 1), 405(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(381: 60.000000), (385: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(381: 4), (385: 4), (386: 1), (387: 2), (389: 4), (390: 1), (397: 1), (405: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
