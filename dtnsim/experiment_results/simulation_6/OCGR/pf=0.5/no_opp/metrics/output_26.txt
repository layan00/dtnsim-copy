The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
165(1 to 11), 168(3 to 10), 169(4 to 6), 170(7 to 9), 173(12 to 4), 174(12 to 5), 177(8 to 1), 192(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(169: 25.000000), (177: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(165: 1), (168: 4), (169: 3), (170: 2), (173: 4), (174: 1), (177: 4), (192: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
