The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
384(1 to 11), 387(3 to 10), 388(4 to 6), 389(7 to 9), 396(12 to 4), 397(12 to 5), 405(8 to 1), 412(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(389: 25.000000), (412: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(384: 2), (387: 2), (388: 1), (389: 3), (396: 2), (397: 4), (405: 2), (412: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
