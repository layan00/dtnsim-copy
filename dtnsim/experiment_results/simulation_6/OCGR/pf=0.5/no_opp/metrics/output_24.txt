The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
495(1 to 11), 499(3 to 10), 500(4 to 6), 501(7 to 9), 504(12 to 4), 505(12 to 5), 510(8 to 1), 518(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(499: 35.000000), (518: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(495: 4), (499: 4), (500: 1), (501: 2), (504: 3), (505: 1), (510: 1), (518: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
