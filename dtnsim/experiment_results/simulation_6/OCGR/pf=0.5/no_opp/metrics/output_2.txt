The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
283(1 to 11), 286(3 to 10), 287(4 to 6), 288(7 to 9), 294(12 to 4), 295(12 to 5), 300(8 to 1), 310(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(286: 35.000000), (287: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(283: 1), (286: 4), (287: 3), (288: 3), (294: 4), (295: 1), (300: 1), (310: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
