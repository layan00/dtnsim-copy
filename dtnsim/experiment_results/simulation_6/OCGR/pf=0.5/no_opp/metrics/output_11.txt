The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
182(1 to 11), 185(3 to 10), 186(4 to 6), 187(7 to 9), 193(12 to 4), 194(12 to 5), 201(8 to 1), 204(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(185: 35.000000), (187: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(182: 1), (185: 4), (186: 1), (187: 3), (193: 3), (194: 3), (201: 1), (204: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
