The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
269(1 to 11), 274(3 to 10), 275(4 to 6), 276(7 to 9), 281(12 to 4), 282(12 to 5), 284(8 to 1), 292(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(274: 35.000000), (281: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(269: 1), (274: 4), (275: 2), (276: 3), (281: 4), (282: 1), (284: 3), (292: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
