The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
376(1 to 11), 380(3 to 10), 381(4 to 6), 382(7 to 9), 386(12 to 4), 387(12 to 5), 393(8 to 1), 401(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(401: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(376: 2), (380: 3), (381: 1), (382: 2), (386: 3), (387: 1), (393: 2), (401: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
