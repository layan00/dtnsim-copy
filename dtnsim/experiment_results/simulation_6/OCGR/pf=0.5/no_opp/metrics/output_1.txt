The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(1 to 11), 189(3 to 10), 190(4 to 6), 191(7 to 9), 197(12 to 4), 198(12 to 5), 202(8 to 1), 207(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 1), (189: 5), (190: 1), (191: 2), (197: 2), (198: 2), (202: 1), (207: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
