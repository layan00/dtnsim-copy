The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(1 to 11), 176(3 to 10), 177(4 to 6), 178(7 to 9), 180(12 to 4), 181(12 to 5), 187(8 to 1), 191(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 1), (176: 3), (177: 1), (178: 3), (180: 3), (181: 2), (187: 1), (191: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
