The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
68(1 to 11), 72(3 to 10), 73(4 to 6), 74(7 to 9), 80(12 to 4), 81(12 to 5), 84(8 to 1), 88(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(74: 25.000000), (88: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(68: 1), (72: 3), (73: 1), (74: 3), (80: 3), (81: 1), (84: 1), (88: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 68: (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
