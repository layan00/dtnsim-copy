The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
489(1 to 11), 494(3 to 10), 495(4 to 6), 496(7 to 9), 497(12 to 4), 498(12 to 5), 504(8 to 1), 519(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(489: 60.000000), (494: 35.000000), (495: 25.000000), (504: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(489: 4), (494: 4), (495: 3), (496: 2), (497: 3), (498: 1), (504: 4), (519: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
