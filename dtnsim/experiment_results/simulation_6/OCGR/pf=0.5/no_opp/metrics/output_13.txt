The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
393(1 to 11), 399(3 to 10), 400(4 to 6), 401(7 to 9), 409(12 to 4), 410(12 to 5), 419(8 to 1), 430(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(400: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(393: 4), (399: 3), (400: 3), (401: 3), (409: 3), (410: 3), (419: 4), (430: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
