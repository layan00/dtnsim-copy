The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
496(1 to 11), 500(3 to 10), 501(4 to 6), 502(7 to 9), 506(12 to 4), 507(12 to 5), 515(8 to 1), 522(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(506: 25.000000), (522: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(496: 2), (500: 2), (501: 2), (502: 2), (506: 4), (507: 2), (515: 1), (522: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
