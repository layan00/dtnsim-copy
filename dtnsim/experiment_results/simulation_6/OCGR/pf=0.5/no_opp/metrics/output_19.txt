The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
483(1 to 11), 488(3 to 10), 489(4 to 6), 490(7 to 9), 495(12 to 4), 496(12 to 5), 501(8 to 1), 511(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(490: 25.000000), (496: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(483: 1), (488: 2), (489: 2), (490: 3), (495: 2), (496: 4), (501: 1), (511: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
