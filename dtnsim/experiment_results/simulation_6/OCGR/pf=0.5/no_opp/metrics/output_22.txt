The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
288(1 to 11), 295(3 to 10), 296(4 to 6), 297(7 to 9), 302(12 to 4), 303(12 to 5), 307(8 to 1), 314(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(288: 1), (295: 3), (296: 2), (297: 2), (302: 2), (303: 2), (307: 1), (314: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
