The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
77(1 to 11), 85(3 to 10), 86(4 to 6), 87(7 to 9), 94(12 to 4), 95(12 to 5), 102(8 to 1), 112(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(86: 25.000000), (94: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(77: 4), (85: 3), (86: 3), (87: 3), (94: 5), (95: 1), (102: 1), (112: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
