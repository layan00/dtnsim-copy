The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
190(1 to 11), 196(3 to 10), 197(4 to 6), 198(7 to 9), 204(12 to 4), 205(12 to 5), 210(8 to 1), 214(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(190: 1), (196: 3), (197: 1), (198: 2), (204: 3), (205: 2), (210: 1), (214: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
