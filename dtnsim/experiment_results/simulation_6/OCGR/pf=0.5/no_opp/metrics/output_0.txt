The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
74(1 to 11), 80(3 to 10), 81(4 to 6), 82(7 to 9), 89(12 to 4), 90(12 to 5), 93(8 to 1), 106(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 25.000000), (82: 25.000000), (106: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(74: 3), (80: 3), (81: 3), (82: 3), (89: 3), (90: 1), (93: 1), (106: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
