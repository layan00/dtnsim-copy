The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
71(1 to 11), 74(3 to 10), 75(4 to 6), 76(7 to 9), 81(12 to 4), 82(12 to 5), 86(8 to 1), 95(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(71: 60.000000), (74: 35.000000), (76: 25.000000), (95: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(71: 4), (74: 4), (75: 1), (76: 3), (81: 3), (82: 1), (86: 1), (95: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
