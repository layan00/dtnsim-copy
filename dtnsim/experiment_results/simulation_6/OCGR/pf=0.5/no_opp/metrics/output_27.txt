The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
273(1 to 11), 277(3 to 10), 278(4 to 6), 279(7 to 9), 283(12 to 4), 284(12 to 5), 290(8 to 1), 297(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(277: 35.000000), (283: 25.000000), (297: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(273: 1), (277: 4), (278: 1), (279: 2), (283: 4), (284: 2), (290: 1), (297: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
