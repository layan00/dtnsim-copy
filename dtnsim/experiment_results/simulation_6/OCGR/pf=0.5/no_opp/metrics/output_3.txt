The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
388(1 to 11), 391(3 to 10), 392(4 to 6), 393(7 to 9), 396(12 to 4), 397(12 to 5), 403(8 to 1), 407(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(388: 2), (391: 3), (392: 1), (393: 2), (396: 3), (397: 1), (403: 2), (407: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
