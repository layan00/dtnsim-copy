The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
617(1 to 11), 634(3 to 10), 635(4 to 6), 636(7 to 9), 639(12 to 4), 640(12 to 5), 667(8 to 1), 682(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(635: 25.000000), (667: 15.000000), (682: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(617: 3), (634: 4), (635: 3), (636: 2), (639: 4), (640: 2), (667: 4), (682: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
