The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1459(1 to 11), 1478(3 to 10), 1479(4 to 6), 1480(7 to 9), 1483(12 to 4), 1484(12 to 5), 1510(8 to 1), 1519(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1478: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1459: 8), (1478: 6), (1479: 3), (1480: 2), (1483: 3), (1484: 2), (1510: 1), (1519: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
