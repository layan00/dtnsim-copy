The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1446(1 to 11), 1464(3 to 10), 1465(4 to 6), 1466(7 to 9), 1473(12 to 4), 1474(12 to 5), 1505(8 to 1), 1512(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1465: 55.000000), (1466: 25.000000), (1512: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1446: 5), (1464: 2), (1465: 4), (1466: 3), (1473: 2), (1474: 4), (1505: 2), (1512: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
