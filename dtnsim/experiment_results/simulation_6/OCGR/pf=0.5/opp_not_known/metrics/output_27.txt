The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1030(1 to 11), 1048(3 to 10), 1049(4 to 6), 1050(7 to 9), 1054(12 to 4), 1055(12 to 5), 1085(8 to 1), 1092(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1030: 60.000000), (1048: 35.000000), (1054: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1030: 3), (1048: 4), (1049: 4), (1050: 2), (1054: 4), (1055: 2), (1085: 1), (1092: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
