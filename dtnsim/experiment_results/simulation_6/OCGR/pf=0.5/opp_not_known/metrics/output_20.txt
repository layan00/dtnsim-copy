The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(1 to 11), 246(3 to 10), 247(4 to 6), 248(7 to 9), 255(12 to 4), 256(12 to 5), 288(8 to 1), 297(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 20.000000), (246: 15.000000), (247: 25.000000), (255: 25.000000), (297: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 5), (246: 5), (247: 3), (248: 3), (255: 5), (256: 2), (288: 1), (297: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
