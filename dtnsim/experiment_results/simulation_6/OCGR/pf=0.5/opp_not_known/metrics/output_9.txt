The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1845(1 to 11), 1863(3 to 10), 1864(4 to 6), 1865(7 to 9), 1868(12 to 4), 1869(12 to 5), 1894(8 to 1), 1899(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1865: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1845: 5), (1863: 2), (1864: 4), (1865: 3), (1868: 3), (1869: 2), (1894: 1), (1899: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 45 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
