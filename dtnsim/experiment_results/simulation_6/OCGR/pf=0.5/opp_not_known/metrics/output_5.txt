The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 11), 231(3 to 10), 232(4 to 6), 233(7 to 9), 239(12 to 4), 240(12 to 5), 267(8 to 1), 271(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 55.000000), (233: 25.000000), (271: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 5), (231: 6), (232: 4), (233: 3), (239: 3), (240: 2), (267: 1), (271: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
