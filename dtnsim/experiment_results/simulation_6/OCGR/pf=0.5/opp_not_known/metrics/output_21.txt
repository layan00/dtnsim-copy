The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
642(1 to 11), 662(3 to 10), 663(4 to 6), 664(7 to 9), 670(12 to 4), 671(12 to 5), 702(8 to 1), 706(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(662: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(642: 3), (662: 5), (663: 4), (664: 2), (670: 3), (671: 2), (702: 1), (706: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
