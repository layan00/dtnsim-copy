The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1869(1 to 11), 1889(3 to 10), 1890(4 to 6), 1891(7 to 9), 1894(12 to 4), 1895(12 to 5), 1923(8 to 1), 1930(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1889: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1869: 5), (1889: 4), (1890: 4), (1891: 2), (1894: 3), (1895: 2), (1923: 1), (1930: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
