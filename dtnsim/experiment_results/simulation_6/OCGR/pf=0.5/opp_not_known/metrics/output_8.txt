The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1440(1 to 11), 1459(3 to 10), 1460(4 to 6), 1461(7 to 9), 1463(12 to 4), 1464(12 to 5), 1494(8 to 1), 1501(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1459: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1440: 5), (1459: 4), (1460: 4), (1461: 2), (1463: 4), (1464: 2), (1494: 1), (1501: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 45 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
