The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
633(1 to 11), 651(3 to 10), 652(4 to 6), 653(7 to 9), 659(12 to 4), 660(12 to 5), 688(8 to 1), 693(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(633: 3), (651: 5), (652: 4), (653: 2), (659: 2), (660: 2), (688: 1), (693: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
