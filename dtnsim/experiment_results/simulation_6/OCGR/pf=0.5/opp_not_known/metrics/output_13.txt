The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1452(1 to 11), 1472(3 to 10), 1473(4 to 6), 1474(7 to 9), 1482(12 to 4), 1483(12 to 5), 1517(8 to 1), 1527(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1472: 15.000000), (1473: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1452: 3), (1472: 5), (1473: 3), (1474: 3), (1482: 3), (1483: 3), (1517: 4), (1527: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
