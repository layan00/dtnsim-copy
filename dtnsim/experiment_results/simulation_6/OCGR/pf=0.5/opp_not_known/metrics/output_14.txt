The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1871(1 to 11), 1891(3 to 10), 1892(4 to 6), 1893(7 to 9), 1898(12 to 4), 1899(12 to 5), 1929(8 to 1), 1933(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1891: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1871: 5), (1891: 5), (1892: 4), (1893: 3), (1898: 3), (1899: 2), (1929: 1), (1933: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
