The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1855(1 to 11), 1874(3 to 10), 1875(4 to 6), 1876(7 to 9), 1877(12 to 4), 1878(12 to 5), 1907(8 to 1), 1921(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1855: 60.000000), (1874: 35.000000), (1875: 25.000000), (1878: 85.000000), (1907: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1855: 3), (1874: 4), (1875: 3), (1876: 2), (1877: 3), (1878: 5), (1907: 4), (1921: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
