The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1026(1 to 11), 1045(3 to 10), 1046(4 to 6), 1047(7 to 9), 1052(12 to 4), 1053(12 to 5), 1079(8 to 1), 1087(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1026: 60.000000), (1045: 35.000000), (1052: 85.000000), (1087: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1026: 3), (1045: 4), (1046: 2), (1047: 3), (1052: 4), (1053: 1), (1079: 3), (1087: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
