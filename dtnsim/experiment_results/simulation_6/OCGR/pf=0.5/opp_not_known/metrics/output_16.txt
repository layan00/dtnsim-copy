The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
621(1 to 11), 639(3 to 10), 640(4 to 6), 641(7 to 9), 643(12 to 4), 644(12 to 5), 674(8 to 1), 678(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(621: 60.000000), (639: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(621: 3), (639: 6), (640: 4), (641: 3), (643: 3), (644: 2), (674: 1), (678: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
