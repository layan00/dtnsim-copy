The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 11), 235(3 to 10), 236(4 to 6), 237(7 to 9), 242(12 to 4), 243(12 to 5), 270(8 to 1), 278(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 20.000000), (235: 35.000000), (236: 55.000000), (237: 25.000000), (278: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 5), (235: 4), (236: 4), (237: 3), (242: 3), (243: 2), (270: 1), (278: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
