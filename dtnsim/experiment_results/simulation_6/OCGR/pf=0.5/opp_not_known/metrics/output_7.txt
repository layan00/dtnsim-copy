The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1037(1 to 11), 1052(3 to 10), 1053(4 to 6), 1054(7 to 9), 1058(12 to 4), 1059(12 to 5), 1087(8 to 1), 1094(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1037: 60.000000), (1094: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1037: 3), (1052: 2), (1053: 2), (1054: 2), (1058: 3), (1059: 2), (1087: 3), (1094: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
