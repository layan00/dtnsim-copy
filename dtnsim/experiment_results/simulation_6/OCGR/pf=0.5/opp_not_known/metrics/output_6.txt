The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
626(1 to 11), 646(3 to 10), 647(4 to 6), 648(7 to 9), 653(12 to 4), 654(12 to 5), 686(8 to 1), 694(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(626: 5), (646: 4), (647: 4), (648: 2), (653: 4), (654: 4), (686: 1), (694: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
