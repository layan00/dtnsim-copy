The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1036(1 to 11), 1053(3 to 10), 1054(4 to 6), 1055(7 to 9), 1061(12 to 4), 1062(12 to 5), 1091(8 to 1), 1101(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1036: 60.000000), (1053: 35.000000), (1054: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1036: 3), (1053: 4), (1054: 3), (1055: 3), (1061: 4), (1062: 2), (1091: 1), (1101: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
