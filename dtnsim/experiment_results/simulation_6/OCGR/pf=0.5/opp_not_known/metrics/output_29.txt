The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1863(1 to 11), 1882(3 to 10), 1883(4 to 6), 1884(7 to 9), 1888(12 to 4), 1889(12 to 5), 1920(8 to 1), 1928(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1888: 25.000000), (1928: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1863: 6), (1882: 2), (1883: 2), (1884: 2), (1888: 4), (1889: 2), (1920: 1), (1928: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
