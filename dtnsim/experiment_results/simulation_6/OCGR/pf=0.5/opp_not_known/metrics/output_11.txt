The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
630(1 to 11), 647(3 to 10), 648(4 to 6), 649(7 to 9), 655(12 to 4), 656(12 to 5), 687(8 to 1), 690(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(630: 60.000000), (647: 35.000000), (648: 55.000000), (649: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(630: 3), (647: 4), (648: 4), (649: 3), (655: 3), (656: 3), (687: 1), (690: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
