The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1444(1 to 11), 1462(3 to 10), 1463(4 to 6), 1464(7 to 9), 1467(12 to 4), 1468(12 to 5), 1497(8 to 1), 1501(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1462: 55.000000), (1463: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1444: 5), (1462: 6), (1463: 4), (1464: 2), (1467: 3), (1468: 2), (1497: 2), (1501: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 48 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
