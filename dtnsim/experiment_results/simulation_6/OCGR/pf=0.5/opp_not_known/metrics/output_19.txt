The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1855(1 to 11), 1874(3 to 10), 1875(4 to 6), 1876(7 to 9), 1881(12 to 4), 1882(12 to 5), 1911(8 to 1), 1921(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1876: 25.000000), (1882: 15.000000), (1921: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1855: 3), (1874: 2), (1875: 2), (1876: 3), (1881: 2), (1882: 4), (1911: 1), (1921: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
