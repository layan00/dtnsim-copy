The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1440(1 to 11), 1458(3 to 10), 1459(4 to 6), 1460(7 to 9), 1464(12 to 4), 1465(12 to 5), 1494(8 to 1), 1502(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1440: 60.000000), (1458: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1440: 3), (1458: 6), (1459: 4), (1460: 2), (1464: 3), (1465: 2), (1494: 2), (1502: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
