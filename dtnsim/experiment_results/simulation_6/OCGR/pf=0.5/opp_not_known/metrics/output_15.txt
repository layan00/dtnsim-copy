The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 11), 235(3 to 10), 236(4 to 6), 237(7 to 9), 241(12 to 4), 242(12 to 5), 274(8 to 1), 276(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 15.000000), (236: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 5), (235: 5), (236: 4), (237: 3), (241: 5), (242: 1), (274: 1), (276: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
