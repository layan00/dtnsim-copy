The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 11), 238(3 to 10), 239(4 to 6), 240(7 to 9), 247(12 to 4), 248(12 to 5), 276(8 to 1), 288(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 60.000000), (238: 15.000000), (239: 25.000000), (240: 25.000000), (288: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 3), (238: 5), (239: 3), (240: 3), (247: 3), (248: 2), (276: 1), (288: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
