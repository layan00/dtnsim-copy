The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1048(1 to 11), 1069(3 to 10), 1070(4 to 6), 1071(7 to 9), 1076(12 to 4), 1077(12 to 5), 1107(8 to 1), 1114(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1069: 15.000000), (1114: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1048: 3), (1069: 5), (1070: 2), (1071: 2), (1076: 2), (1077: 2), (1107: 1), (1114: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
