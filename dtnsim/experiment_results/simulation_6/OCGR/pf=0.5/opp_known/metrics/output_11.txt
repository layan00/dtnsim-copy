The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
498(1 to 11), 503(3 to 10), 504(4 to 6), 505(7 to 9), 511(12 to 4), 512(12 to 5), 531(8 to 1), 534(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(498: 60.000000), (503: 35.000000), (504: 55.000000), (505: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(498: 4), (503: 4), (504: 4), (505: 3), (511: 3), (512: 3), (531: 1), (534: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
