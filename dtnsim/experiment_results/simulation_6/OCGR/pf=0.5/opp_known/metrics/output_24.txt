The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1389(1 to 11), 1397(3 to 10), 1398(4 to 6), 1399(7 to 9), 1402(12 to 4), 1403(12 to 5), 1420(8 to 1), 1427(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1397: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1389: 5), (1397: 4), (1398: 4), (1399: 2), (1402: 3), (1403: 3), (1420: 1), (1427: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
