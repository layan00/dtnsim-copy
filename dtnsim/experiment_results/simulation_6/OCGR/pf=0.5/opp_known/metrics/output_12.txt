The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
790(1 to 11), 796(3 to 10), 797(4 to 6), 798(7 to 9), 802(12 to 4), 803(12 to 5), 816(8 to 1), 820(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(796: 35.000000), (797: 55.000000), (820: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(790: 4), (796: 4), (797: 4), (798: 2), (802: 3), (803: 3), (816: 1), (820: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
