The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(1 to 11), 207(3 to 10), 208(4 to 6), 209(7 to 9), 215(12 to 4), 216(12 to 5), 232(8 to 1), 236(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 55.000000), (209: 25.000000), (236: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 5), (207: 6), (208: 4), (209: 3), (215: 3), (216: 3), (232: 1), (236: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
