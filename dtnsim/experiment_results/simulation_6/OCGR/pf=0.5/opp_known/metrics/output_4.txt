The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1367(1 to 11), 1374(3 to 10), 1375(4 to 6), 1376(7 to 9), 1377(12 to 4), 1378(12 to 5), 1396(8 to 1), 1410(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1367: 60.000000), (1374: 35.000000), (1375: 25.000000), (1396: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1367: 4), (1374: 4), (1375: 3), (1376: 2), (1377: 3), (1378: 3), (1396: 4), (1410: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
