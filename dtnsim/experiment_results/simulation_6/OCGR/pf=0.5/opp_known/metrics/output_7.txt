The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
794(1 to 11), 797(3 to 10), 798(4 to 6), 799(7 to 9), 803(12 to 4), 804(12 to 5), 821(8 to 1), 828(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(794: 60.000000), (828: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(794: 4), (797: 2), (798: 2), (799: 2), (803: 3), (804: 3), (821: 3), (828: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
