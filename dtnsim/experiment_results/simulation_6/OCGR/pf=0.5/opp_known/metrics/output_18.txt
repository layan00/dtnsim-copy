The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1083(1 to 11), 1089(3 to 10), 1090(4 to 6), 1091(7 to 9), 1095(12 to 4), 1096(12 to 5), 1114(8 to 1), 1122(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1083: 60.000000), (1089: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1083: 4), (1089: 6), (1090: 4), (1091: 2), (1095: 3), (1096: 3), (1114: 2), (1122: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
