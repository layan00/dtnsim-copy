The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1379(1 to 11), 1387(3 to 10), 1388(4 to 6), 1389(7 to 9), 1394(12 to 4), 1395(12 to 5), 1414(8 to 1), 1418(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1387: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1379: 5), (1387: 4), (1388: 4), (1389: 3), (1394: 3), (1395: 3), (1414: 1), (1418: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
