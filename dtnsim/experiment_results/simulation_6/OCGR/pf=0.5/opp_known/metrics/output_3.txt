The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1075(1 to 11), 1081(3 to 10), 1082(4 to 6), 1083(7 to 9), 1086(12 to 4), 1087(12 to 5), 1105(8 to 1), 1109(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1081: 55.000000), (1082: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1075: 5), (1081: 6), (1082: 4), (1083: 2), (1086: 3), (1087: 3), (1105: 2), (1109: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
