The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1077(1 to 11), 1084(3 to 10), 1085(4 to 6), 1086(7 to 9), 1088(12 to 4), 1089(12 to 5), 1109(8 to 1), 1116(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1084: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1077: 5), (1084: 4), (1085: 4), (1086: 2), (1088: 5), (1089: 5), (1109: 1), (1116: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
