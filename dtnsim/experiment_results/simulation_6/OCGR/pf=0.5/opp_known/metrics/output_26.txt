The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
490(1 to 11), 495(3 to 10), 496(4 to 6), 497(7 to 9), 500(12 to 4), 501(12 to 5), 516(8 to 1), 531(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 25.000000), (516: 15.000000), (531: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(490: 4), (495: 4), (496: 3), (497: 2), (500: 4), (501: 4), (516: 4), (531: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
