The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1364(1 to 11), 1370(3 to 10), 1371(4 to 6), 1372(7 to 9), 1375(12 to 4), 1376(12 to 5), 1389(8 to 1), 1394(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1372: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1364: 5), (1370: 2), (1371: 4), (1372: 3), (1375: 3), (1376: 3), (1389: 1), (1394: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
