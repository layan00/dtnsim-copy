The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
809(1 to 11), 818(3 to 10), 819(4 to 6), 820(7 to 9), 825(12 to 4), 826(12 to 5), 844(8 to 1), 851(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(818: 15.000000), (851: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(809: 4), (818: 4), (819: 2), (820: 2), (825: 3), (826: 3), (844: 1), (851: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
