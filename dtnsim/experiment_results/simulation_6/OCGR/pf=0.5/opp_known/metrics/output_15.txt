The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 11), 211(3 to 10), 212(4 to 6), 213(7 to 9), 217(12 to 4), 218(12 to 5), 240(8 to 1), 242(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(211: 15.000000), (212: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 5), (211: 4), (212: 4), (213: 3), (217: 5), (218: 5), (240: 1), (242: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
