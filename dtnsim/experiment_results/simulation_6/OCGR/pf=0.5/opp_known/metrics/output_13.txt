The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1080(1 to 11), 1088(3 to 10), 1089(4 to 6), 1090(7 to 9), 1098(12 to 4), 1099(12 to 5), 1121(8 to 1), 1131(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1088: 15.000000), (1089: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1080: 4), (1088: 4), (1089: 3), (1090: 3), (1098: 3), (1099: 3), (1121: 4), (1131: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
