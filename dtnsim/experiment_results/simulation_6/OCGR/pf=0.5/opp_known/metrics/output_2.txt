The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
785(1 to 11), 790(3 to 10), 791(4 to 6), 792(7 to 9), 798(12 to 4), 799(12 to 5), 818(8 to 1), 828(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(785: 60.000000), (790: 35.000000), (791: 25.000000), (828: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(785: 4), (790: 4), (791: 3), (792: 3), (798: 5), (799: 5), (818: 1), (828: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
