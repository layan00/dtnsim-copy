The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1378(1 to 11), 1385(3 to 10), 1386(4 to 6), 1387(7 to 9), 1392(12 to 4), 1393(12 to 5), 1411(8 to 1), 1425(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1387: 25.000000), (1392: 15.000000), (1393: 15.000000), (1425: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1378: 4), (1385: 2), (1386: 2), (1387: 3), (1392: 6), (1393: 4), (1411: 1), (1425: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
