The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1100(1 to 11), 1107(3 to 10), 1108(4 to 6), 1109(7 to 9), 1112(12 to 4), 1113(12 to 5), 1127(8 to 1), 1136(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1107: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1100: 7), (1107: 6), (1108: 3), (1109: 2), (1112: 3), (1113: 3), (1127: 1), (1136: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
