The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1084(1 to 11), 1090(3 to 10), 1091(4 to 6), 1092(7 to 9), 1099(12 to 4), 1100(12 to 5), 1120(8 to 1), 1128(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1091: 55.000000), (1092: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1084: 5), (1090: 2), (1091: 4), (1092: 3), (1099: 5), (1100: 5), (1120: 2), (1128: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
