The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(1 to 11), 249(3 to 10), 250(4 to 6), 251(7 to 9), 257(12 to 4), 258(12 to 5), 289(8 to 1), 304(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(249: 55.000000), (251: 25.000000), (257: 25.000000), (289: 15.000000), (304: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 8), (249: 6), (250: 3), (251: 3), (257: 5), (258: 2), (289: 4), (304: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
