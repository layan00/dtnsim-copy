The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
673(1 to 11), 695(3 to 10), 696(4 to 6), 697(7 to 9), 705(12 to 4), 706(12 to 5), 737(8 to 1), 755(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(695: 35.000000), (696: 25.000000), (697: 25.000000), (737: 15.000000), (755: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(673: 9), (695: 6), (696: 3), (697: 3), (705: 4), (706: 2), (737: 4), (755: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
