The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
683(1 to 11), 705(3 to 10), 706(4 to 6), 707(7 to 9), 718(12 to 4), 719(12 to 5), 751(8 to 1), 757(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(683: 60.000000), (705: 25.000000), (706: 55.000000), (718: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(683: 3), (705: 5), (706: 4), (707: 3), (718: 8), (719: 3), (751: 1), (757: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
