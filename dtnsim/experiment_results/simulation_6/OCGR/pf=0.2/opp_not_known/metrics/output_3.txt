The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1573(1 to 11), 1595(3 to 10), 1596(4 to 6), 1597(7 to 9), 1603(12 to 4), 1604(12 to 5), 1634(8 to 1), 1643(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1573: 20.000000), (1595: 35.000000), (1596: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1573: 5), (1595: 4), (1596: 4), (1597: 2), (1603: 2), (1604: 2), (1634: 2), (1643: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
