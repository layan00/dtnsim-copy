The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
666(1 to 11), 685(3 to 10), 686(4 to 6), 687(7 to 9), 695(12 to 4), 696(12 to 5), 728(8 to 1), 733(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(666: 60.000000), (685: 35.000000), (686: 55.000000), (695: 25.000000), (733: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(666: 3), (685: 4), (686: 4), (687: 3), (695: 4), (696: 3), (728: 2), (733: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
