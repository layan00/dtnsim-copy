The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1987(1 to 11), 2008(3 to 10), 2009(4 to 6), 2010(7 to 9), 2021(12 to 4), 2022(12 to 5), 2052(8 to 1), 2070(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1987: 60.000000), (2008: 25.000000), (2009: 25.000000), (2010: 25.000000), (2022: 15.000000), (2052: 15.000000), (2070: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1987: 3), (2008: 5), (2009: 3), (2010: 3), (2021: 2), (2022: 4), (2052: 4), (2070: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
