The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1120(1 to 11), 1142(3 to 10), 1143(4 to 6), 1144(7 to 9), 1153(12 to 4), 1154(12 to 5), 1185(8 to 1), 1197(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1142: 25.000000), (1143: 25.000000), (1153: 25.000000), (1197: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1120: 3), (1142: 5), (1143: 3), (1144: 2), (1153: 4), (1154: 2), (1185: 1), (1197: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
