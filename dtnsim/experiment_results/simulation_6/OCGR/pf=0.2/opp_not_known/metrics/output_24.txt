The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2013(1 to 11), 2037(3 to 10), 2038(4 to 6), 2039(7 to 9), 2044(12 to 4), 2045(12 to 5), 2077(8 to 1), 2093(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2013: 20.000000), (2037: 35.000000), (2038: 25.000000), (2044: 25.000000), (2077: 15.000000), (2093: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2013: 5), (2037: 4), (2038: 3), (2039: 2), (2044: 4), (2045: 2), (2077: 4), (2093: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
