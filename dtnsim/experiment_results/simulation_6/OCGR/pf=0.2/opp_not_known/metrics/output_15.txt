The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(1 to 11), 249(3 to 10), 250(4 to 6), 251(7 to 9), 260(12 to 4), 261(12 to 5), 293(8 to 1), 300(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 20.000000), (249: 25.000000), (250: 55.000000), (260: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 5), (249: 5), (250: 4), (251: 2), (260: 4), (261: 2), (293: 2), (300: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
