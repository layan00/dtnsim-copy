The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 11), 247(3 to 10), 248(4 to 6), 249(7 to 9), 256(12 to 4), 257(12 to 5), 287(8 to 1), 301(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 20.000000), (247: 15.000000), (248: 25.000000), (249: 25.000000), (256: 85.000000), (257: 85.000000), (301: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 5), (247: 5), (248: 3), (249: 3), (256: 4), (257: 5), (287: 4), (301: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
