The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
674(1 to 11), 697(3 to 10), 698(4 to 6), 699(7 to 9), 710(12 to 4), 711(12 to 5), 742(8 to 1), 753(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 20.000000), (697: 25.000000), (698: 55.000000), (699: 25.000000), (710: 85.000000), (711: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(674: 5), (697: 5), (698: 4), (699: 3), (710: 8), (711: 4), (742: 2), (753: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 45 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
