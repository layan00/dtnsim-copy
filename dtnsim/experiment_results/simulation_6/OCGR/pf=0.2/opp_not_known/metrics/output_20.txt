The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
229(1 to 11), 254(3 to 10), 255(4 to 6), 256(7 to 9), 266(12 to 4), 267(12 to 5), 297(8 to 1), 310(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 20.000000), (254: 25.000000), (255: 25.000000), (256: 25.000000), (266: 25.000000), (310: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(229: 5), (254: 5), (255: 3), (256: 3), (266: 5), (267: 2), (297: 1), (310: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
