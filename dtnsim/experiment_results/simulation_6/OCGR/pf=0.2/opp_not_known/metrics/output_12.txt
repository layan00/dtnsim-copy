The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1098(1 to 11), 1118(3 to 10), 1119(4 to 6), 1120(7 to 9), 1125(12 to 4), 1126(12 to 5), 1157(8 to 1), 1163(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1098: 60.000000), (1118: 15.000000), (1119: 55.000000), (1120: 45.000000), (1125: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1098: 3), (1118: 5), (1119: 4), (1120: 3), (1125: 5), (1126: 2), (1157: 1), (1163: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
