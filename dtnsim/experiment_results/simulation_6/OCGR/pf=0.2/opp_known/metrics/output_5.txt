The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(1 to 11), 225(3 to 10), 226(4 to 6), 227(7 to 9), 233(12 to 4), 234(12 to 5), 255(8 to 1), 270(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 55.000000), (227: 25.000000), (233: 25.000000), (234: 45.000000), (255: 15.000000), (270: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 7), (225: 6), (226: 3), (227: 3), (233: 5), (234: 7), (255: 4), (270: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
