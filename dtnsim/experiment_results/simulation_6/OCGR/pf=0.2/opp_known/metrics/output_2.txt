The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
872(1 to 11), 879(3 to 10), 880(4 to 6), 881(7 to 9), 889(12 to 4), 890(12 to 5), 911(8 to 1), 925(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(872: 60.000000), (879: 35.000000), (880: 25.000000), (925: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(872: 4), (879: 4), (880: 3), (881: 3), (889: 3), (890: 3), (911: 4), (925: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
