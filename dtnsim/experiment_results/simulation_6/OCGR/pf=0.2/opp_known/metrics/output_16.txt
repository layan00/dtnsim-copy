The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
534(1 to 11), 543(3 to 10), 544(4 to 6), 545(7 to 9), 548(12 to 4), 549(12 to 5), 570(8 to 1), 582(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(543: 55.000000), (545: 45.000000), (570: 15.000000), (582: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(534: 5), (543: 6), (544: 3), (545: 3), (548: 5), (549: 5), (570: 4), (582: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
