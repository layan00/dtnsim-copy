The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 11), 230(3 to 10), 231(4 to 6), 232(7 to 9), 240(12 to 4), 241(12 to 5), 263(8 to 1), 275(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(217: 20.000000), (230: 15.000000), (231: 25.000000), (232: 25.000000), (240: 25.000000), (241: 45.000000), (275: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 5), (230: 4), (231: 3), (232: 3), (240: 5), (241: 7), (263: 1), (275: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
