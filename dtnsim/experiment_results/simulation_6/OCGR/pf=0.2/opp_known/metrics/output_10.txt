The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 11), 223(3 to 10), 224(4 to 6), 225(7 to 9), 232(12 to 4), 233(12 to 5), 251(8 to 1), 265(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 20.000000), (223: 15.000000), (224: 25.000000), (225: 25.000000), (232: 85.000000), (233: 85.000000), (265: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 5), (223: 4), (224: 3), (225: 3), (232: 4), (233: 6), (251: 4), (265: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
