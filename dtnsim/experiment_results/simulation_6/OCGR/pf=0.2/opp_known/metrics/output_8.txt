The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1217(1 to 11), 1229(3 to 10), 1230(4 to 6), 1231(7 to 9), 1236(12 to 4), 1237(12 to 5), 1258(8 to 1), 1273(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1217: 20.000000), (1229: 35.000000), (1230: 25.000000), (1236: 85.000000), (1237: 85.000000), (1258: 15.000000), (1273: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1217: 5), (1229: 4), (1230: 3), (1231: 2), (1236: 9), (1237: 11), (1258: 4), (1273: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
