The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1194(1 to 11), 1204(3 to 10), 1205(4 to 6), 1206(7 to 9), 1212(12 to 4), 1213(12 to 5), 1231(8 to 1), 1240(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1194: 20.000000), (1204: 35.000000), (1205: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1194: 5), (1204: 4), (1205: 4), (1206: 2), (1212: 3), (1213: 3), (1231: 2), (1240: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
