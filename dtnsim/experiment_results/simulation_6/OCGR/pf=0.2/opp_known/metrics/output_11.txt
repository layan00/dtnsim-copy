The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
534(1 to 11), 541(3 to 10), 542(4 to 6), 543(7 to 9), 551(12 to 4), 552(12 to 5), 572(8 to 1), 577(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(534: 60.000000), (541: 35.000000), (542: 55.000000), (577: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(534: 4), (541: 4), (542: 4), (543: 3), (551: 3), (552: 3), (572: 2), (577: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
