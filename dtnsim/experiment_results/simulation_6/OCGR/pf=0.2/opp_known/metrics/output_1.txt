The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
552(1 to 11), 562(3 to 10), 563(4 to 6), 564(7 to 9), 573(12 to 4), 574(12 to 5), 596(8 to 1), 601(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(552: 60.000000), (562: 15.000000), (563: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(552: 4), (562: 4), (563: 4), (564: 3), (573: 3), (574: 3), (596: 1), (601: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
