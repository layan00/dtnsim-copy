The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1197(1 to 11), 1208(3 to 10), 1209(4 to 6), 1210(7 to 9), 1217(12 to 4), 1218(12 to 5), 1238(8 to 1), 1256(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1197: 20.000000), (1208: 35.000000), (1209: 25.000000), (1210: 25.000000), (1217: 85.000000), (1218: 85.000000), (1238: 15.000000), (1256: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1197: 5), (1208: 4), (1209: 3), (1210: 3), (1217: 9), (1218: 11), (1238: 4), (1256: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
