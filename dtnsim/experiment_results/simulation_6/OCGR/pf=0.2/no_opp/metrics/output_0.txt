The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
85(1 to 11), 93(3 to 10), 94(4 to 6), 95(7 to 9), 106(12 to 4), 107(12 to 5), 117(8 to 1), 136(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(85: 60.000000), (93: 25.000000), (94: 25.000000), (95: 25.000000), (106: 25.000000), (107: 15.000000), (117: 15.000000), (136: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(85: 4), (93: 5), (94: 3), (95: 3), (106: 4), (107: 4), (117: 4), (136: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
