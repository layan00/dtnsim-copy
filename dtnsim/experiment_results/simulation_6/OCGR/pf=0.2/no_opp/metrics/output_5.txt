The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(1 to 11), 90(3 to 10), 91(4 to 6), 92(7 to 9), 98(12 to 4), 99(12 to 5), 107(8 to 1), 120(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(92: 25.000000), (98: 25.000000), (107: 15.000000), (120: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 2), (90: 3), (91: 3), (92: 3), (98: 5), (99: 1), (107: 4), (120: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
