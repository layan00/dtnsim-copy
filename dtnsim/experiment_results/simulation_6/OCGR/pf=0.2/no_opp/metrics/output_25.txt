The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(1 to 11), 88(3 to 10), 89(4 to 6), 90(7 to 9), 101(12 to 4), 102(12 to 5), 112(8 to 1), 124(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(88: 25.000000), (90: 25.000000), (102: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 3), (88: 5), (89: 1), (90: 3), (101: 3), (102: 4), (112: 2), (124: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
