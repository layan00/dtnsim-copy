The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
625(1 to 11), 632(3 to 10), 633(4 to 6), 634(7 to 9), 645(12 to 4), 646(12 to 5), 652(8 to 1), 670(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(632: 25.000000), (633: 25.000000), (634: 25.000000), (646: 15.000000), (652: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(625: 1), (632: 5), (633: 3), (634: 3), (645: 2), (646: 4), (652: 4), (670: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
