The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(1 to 11), 88(3 to 10), 89(4 to 6), 90(7 to 9), 99(12 to 4), 100(12 to 5), 109(8 to 1), 117(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 60.000000), (88: 25.000000), (99: 25.000000), (117: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 4), (88: 5), (89: 1), (90: 2), (99: 4), (100: 2), (109: 2), (117: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
