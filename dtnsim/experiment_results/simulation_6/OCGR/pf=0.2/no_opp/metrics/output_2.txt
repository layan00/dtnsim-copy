The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
379(1 to 11), 384(3 to 10), 385(4 to 6), 386(7 to 9), 394(12 to 4), 395(12 to 5), 405(8 to 1), 420(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(379: 60.000000), (384: 35.000000), (385: 25.000000), (394: 25.000000), (420: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(379: 4), (384: 4), (385: 3), (386: 3), (394: 4), (395: 3), (405: 4), (420: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
