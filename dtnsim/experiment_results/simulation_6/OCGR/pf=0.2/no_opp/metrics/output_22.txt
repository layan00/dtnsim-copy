The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
362(1 to 11), 370(3 to 10), 371(4 to 6), 372(7 to 9), 381(12 to 4), 382(12 to 5), 390(8 to 1), 403(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(370: 25.000000), (371: 25.000000), (381: 25.000000), (403: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(362: 3), (370: 5), (371: 3), (372: 2), (381: 4), (382: 2), (390: 1), (403: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
