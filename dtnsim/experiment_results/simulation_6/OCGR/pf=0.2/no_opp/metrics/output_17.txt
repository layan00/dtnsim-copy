The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
347(1 to 11), 353(3 to 10), 354(4 to 6), 355(7 to 9), 363(12 to 4), 364(12 to 5), 373(8 to 1), 386(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(347: 60.000000), (353: 35.000000), (355: 25.000000), (364: 15.000000), (386: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(347: 4), (353: 4), (354: 2), (355: 3), (363: 4), (364: 4), (373: 3), (386: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
