The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
626(1 to 11), 634(3 to 10), 635(4 to 6), 636(7 to 9), 647(12 to 4), 648(12 to 5), 658(8 to 1), 674(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(634: 25.000000), (636: 25.000000), (648: 15.000000), (658: 15.000000), (674: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(626: 2), (634: 5), (635: 3), (636: 3), (647: 4), (648: 4), (658: 4), (674: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
