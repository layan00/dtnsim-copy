The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
503(1 to 11), 509(3 to 10), 510(4 to 6), 511(7 to 9), 518(12 to 4), 519(12 to 5), 527(8 to 1), 545(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(509: 35.000000), (510: 25.000000), (511: 25.000000), (527: 15.000000), (545: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(503: 4), (509: 4), (510: 3), (511: 3), (518: 2), (519: 4), (527: 4), (545: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
