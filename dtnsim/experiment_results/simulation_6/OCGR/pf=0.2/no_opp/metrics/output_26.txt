The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 11), 227(3 to 10), 228(4 to 6), 229(7 to 9), 237(12 to 4), 238(12 to 5), 246(8 to 1), 262(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 35.000000), (228: 25.000000), (229: 25.000000), (246: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 4), (227: 6), (228: 3), (229: 3), (237: 4), (238: 1), (246: 4), (262: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
