The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(1 to 11), 218(3 to 10), 219(4 to 6), 220(7 to 9), 228(12 to 4), 229(12 to 5), 237(8 to 1), 242(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 35.000000), (228: 25.000000), (242: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 1), (218: 4), (219: 1), (220: 3), (228: 4), (229: 3), (237: 2), (242: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
