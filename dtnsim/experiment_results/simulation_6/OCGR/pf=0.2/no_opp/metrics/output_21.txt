The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(1 to 11), 234(3 to 10), 235(4 to 6), 236(7 to 9), 247(12 to 4), 248(12 to 5), 255(8 to 1), 266(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 25.000000), (236: 25.000000), (248: 15.000000), (266: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 1), (234: 5), (235: 1), (236: 3), (247: 3), (248: 4), (255: 2), (266: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
