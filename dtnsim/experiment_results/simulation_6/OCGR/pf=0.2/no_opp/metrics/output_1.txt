The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
239(1 to 11), 247(3 to 10), 248(4 to 6), 249(7 to 9), 260(12 to 4), 261(12 to 5), 270(8 to 1), 277(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(239: 60.000000), (247: 25.000000), (277: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(239: 4), (247: 5), (248: 1), (249: 3), (260: 3), (261: 3), (270: 1), (277: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
