The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
523(1 to 11), 528(3 to 10), 529(4 to 6), 530(7 to 9), 536(12 to 4), 537(12 to 5), 544(8 to 1), 554(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(528: 35.000000), (554: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(523: 4), (528: 4), (529: 1), (530: 2), (536: 2), (537: 2), (544: 2), (554: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
