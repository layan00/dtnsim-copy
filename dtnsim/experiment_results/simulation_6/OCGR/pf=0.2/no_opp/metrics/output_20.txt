The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
85(1 to 11), 93(3 to 10), 94(4 to 6), 95(7 to 9), 105(12 to 4), 106(12 to 5), 113(8 to 1), 127(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(85: 60.000000), (93: 25.000000), (94: 25.000000), (95: 25.000000), (105: 25.000000), (127: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(85: 4), (93: 5), (94: 3), (95: 3), (105: 5), (106: 1), (113: 1), (127: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
