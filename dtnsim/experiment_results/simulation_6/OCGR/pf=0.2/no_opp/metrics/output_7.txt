The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
375(1 to 11), 381(3 to 10), 382(4 to 6), 383(7 to 9), 392(12 to 4), 393(12 to 5), 399(8 to 1), 411(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(381: 25.000000), (383: 45.000000), (399: 15.000000), (411: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(375: 1), (381: 5), (382: 3), (383: 3), (392: 2), (393: 3), (399: 4), (411: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
