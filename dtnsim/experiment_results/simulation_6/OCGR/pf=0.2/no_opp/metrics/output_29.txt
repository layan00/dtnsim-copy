The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
645(1 to 11), 652(3 to 10), 653(4 to 6), 654(7 to 9), 660(12 to 4), 661(12 to 5), 670(8 to 1), 681(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(660: 25.000000), (681: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(645: 3), (652: 3), (653: 2), (654: 2), (660: 4), (661: 2), (670: 3), (681: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
