The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(1 to 11), 659(3 to 10), 660(4 to 6), 661(7 to 9), 665(12 to 4), 666(12 to 5), 675(8 to 1), 691(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(654: 60.000000), (659: 35.000000), (660: 25.000000), (661: 45.000000), (665: 25.000000), (675: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 4), (659: 4), (660: 3), (661: 3), (665: 4), (666: 2), (675: 4), (691: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
