The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
509(1 to 11), 515(3 to 10), 516(4 to 6), 517(7 to 9), 525(12 to 4), 526(12 to 5), 536(8 to 1), 543(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 25.000000), (525: 25.000000), (543: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(509: 2), (515: 3), (516: 1), (517: 3), (525: 4), (526: 4), (536: 2), (543: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
