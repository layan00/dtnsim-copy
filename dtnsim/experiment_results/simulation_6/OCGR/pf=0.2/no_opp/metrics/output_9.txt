The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
661(1 to 11), 668(3 to 10), 669(4 to 6), 670(7 to 9), 681(12 to 4), 682(12 to 5), 687(8 to 1), 697(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(668: 25.000000), (670: 25.000000), (682: 15.000000), (697: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(661: 1), (668: 5), (669: 1), (670: 3), (681: 2), (682: 4), (687: 1), (697: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
