The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
488(1 to 11), 494(3 to 10), 495(4 to 6), 496(7 to 9), 503(12 to 4), 504(12 to 5), 512(8 to 1), 525(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 25.000000), (512: 15.000000), (525: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(488: 2), (494: 3), (495: 3), (496: 3), (503: 5), (504: 1), (512: 4), (525: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
