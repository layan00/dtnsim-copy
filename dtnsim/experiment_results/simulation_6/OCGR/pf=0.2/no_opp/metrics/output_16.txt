The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 11), 222(3 to 10), 223(4 to 6), 224(7 to 9), 227(12 to 4), 228(12 to 5), 237(8 to 1), 249(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 45.000000), (237: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 2), (222: 3), (223: 3), (224: 3), (227: 4), (228: 2), (237: 4), (249: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
