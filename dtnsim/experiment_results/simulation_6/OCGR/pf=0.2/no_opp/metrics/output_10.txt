The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 11), 86(3 to 10), 87(4 to 6), 88(7 to 9), 95(12 to 4), 96(12 to 5), 101(8 to 1), 116(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 60.000000), (87: 25.000000), (88: 25.000000), (95: 85.000000), (116: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 4), (86: 3), (87: 3), (88: 3), (95: 4), (96: 1), (101: 4), (116: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
