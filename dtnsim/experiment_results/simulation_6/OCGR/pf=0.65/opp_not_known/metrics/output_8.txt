The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1384(1 to 11), 1401(3 to 10), 1402(4 to 6), 1403(7 to 9), 1405(12 to 4), 1406(12 to 5), 1436(8 to 1), 1442(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1401: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1384: 3), (1401: 4), (1402: 4), (1403: 2), (1405: 4), (1406: 1), (1436: 1), (1442: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
