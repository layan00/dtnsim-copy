The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 11), 230(3 to 10), 231(4 to 6), 232(7 to 9), 234(12 to 4), 235(12 to 5), 265(8 to 1), 267(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 5), (230: 2), (231: 4), (232: 2), (234: 4), (235: 1), (265: 1), (267: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 210: (to: 5, time: 0.000000),
