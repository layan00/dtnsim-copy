The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
607(1 to 11), 625(3 to 10), 626(4 to 6), 627(7 to 9), 630(12 to 4), 631(12 to 5), 660(8 to 1), 664(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(625: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(607: 3), (625: 5), (626: 4), (627: 2), (630: 3), (631: 1), (660: 1), (664: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
