The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1417(1 to 11), 1436(3 to 10), 1437(4 to 6), 1438(7 to 9), 1445(12 to 4), 1446(12 to 5), 1476(8 to 1), 1487(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1436: 35.000000), (1437: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1417: 3), (1436: 4), (1437: 3), (1438: 3), (1445: 2), (1446: 3), (1476: 4), (1487: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
