The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1823(1 to 11), 1840(3 to 10), 1841(4 to 6), 1842(7 to 9), 1844(12 to 4), 1845(12 to 5), 1871(8 to 1), 1877(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1840: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1823: 3), (1840: 4), (1841: 4), (1842: 2), (1844: 3), (1845: 1), (1871: 1), (1877: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
