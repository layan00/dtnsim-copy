The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1017(1 to 11), 1035(3 to 10), 1036(4 to 6), 1037(7 to 9), 1041(12 to 4), 1042(12 to 5), 1067(8 to 1), 1070(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1035: 35.000000), (1036: 55.000000), (1070: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1017: 3), (1035: 4), (1036: 4), (1037: 2), (1041: 3), (1042: 2), (1067: 1), (1070: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
