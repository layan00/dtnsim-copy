The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
630(1 to 11), 650(3 to 10), 651(4 to 6), 652(7 to 9), 656(12 to 4), 657(12 to 5), 685(8 to 1), 689(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(650: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(630: 3), (650: 5), (651: 4), (652: 2), (656: 3), (657: 1), (685: 1), (689: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 44 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
