The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
591(1 to 11), 607(3 to 10), 608(4 to 6), 609(7 to 9), 611(12 to 4), 612(12 to 5), 639(8 to 1), 647(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(591: 3), (607: 4), (608: 4), (609: 2), (611: 4), (612: 2), (639: 2), (647: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 49 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
