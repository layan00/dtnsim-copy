The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
613(1 to 11), 630(3 to 10), 631(4 to 6), 632(7 to 9), 638(12 to 4), 639(12 to 5), 670(8 to 1), 673(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(613: 60.000000), (631: 55.000000), (632: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(613: 3), (630: 4), (631: 4), (632: 3), (638: 3), (639: 3), (670: 1), (673: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
