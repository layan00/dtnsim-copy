The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1772(1 to 11), 1790(3 to 10), 1791(4 to 6), 1792(7 to 9), 1793(12 to 4), 1794(12 to 5), 1821(8 to 1), 1835(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1772: 60.000000), (1791: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1772: 3), (1790: 4), (1791: 3), (1792: 2), (1793: 4), (1794: 1), (1821: 4), (1835: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
