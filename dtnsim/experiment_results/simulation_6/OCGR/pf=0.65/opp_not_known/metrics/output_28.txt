The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1398(1 to 11), 1416(3 to 10), 1417(4 to 6), 1418(7 to 9), 1424(12 to 4), 1425(12 to 5), 1455(8 to 1), 1458(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1398: 5), (1416: 2), (1417: 4), (1418: 3), (1424: 2), (1425: 3), (1455: 2), (1458: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
