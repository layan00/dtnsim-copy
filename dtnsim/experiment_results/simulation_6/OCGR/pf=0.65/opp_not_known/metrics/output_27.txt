The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
991(1 to 11), 1009(3 to 10), 1010(4 to 6), 1011(7 to 9), 1015(12 to 4), 1016(12 to 5), 1045(8 to 1), 1052(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(991: 60.000000), (1009: 35.000000), (1015: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(991: 3), (1009: 4), (1010: 4), (1011: 2), (1015: 4), (1016: 2), (1045: 1), (1052: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
