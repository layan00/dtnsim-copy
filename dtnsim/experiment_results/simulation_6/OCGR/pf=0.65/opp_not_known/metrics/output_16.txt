The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
602(1 to 11), 620(3 to 10), 621(4 to 6), 622(7 to 9), 624(12 to 4), 625(12 to 5), 655(8 to 1), 657(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(602: 3), (620: 2), (621: 4), (622: 2), (624: 3), (625: 2), (655: 1), (657: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
