The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1432(1 to 11), 1450(3 to 10), 1451(4 to 6), 1452(7 to 9), 1454(12 to 4), 1455(12 to 5), 1480(8 to 1), 1487(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1432: 3), (1450: 3), (1451: 3), (1452: 2), (1454: 3), (1455: 2), (1480: 1), (1487: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
