The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
993(1 to 11), 1008(3 to 10), 1009(4 to 6), 1010(7 to 9), 1014(12 to 4), 1015(12 to 5), 1041(8 to 1), 1048(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(993: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(993: 3), (1008: 2), (1009: 2), (1010: 2), (1014: 3), (1015: 2), (1041: 3), (1048: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
