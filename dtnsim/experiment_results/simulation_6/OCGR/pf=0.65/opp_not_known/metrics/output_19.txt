The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1772(1 to 11), 1790(3 to 10), 1791(4 to 6), 1792(7 to 9), 1796(12 to 4), 1797(12 to 5), 1822(8 to 1), 1827(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1792: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1772: 3), (1790: 2), (1791: 2), (1792: 3), (1796: 3), (1797: 2), (1822: 1), (1827: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
