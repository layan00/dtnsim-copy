The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 11), 224(3 to 10), 225(4 to 6), 226(7 to 9), 229(12 to 4), 230(12 to 5), 257(8 to 1), 259(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 5), (224: 6), (225: 4), (226: 2), (229: 3), (230: 2), (257: 1), (259: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
