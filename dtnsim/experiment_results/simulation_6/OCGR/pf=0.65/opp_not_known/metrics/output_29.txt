The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1797(1 to 11), 1815(3 to 10), 1816(4 to 6), 1817(7 to 9), 1821(12 to 4), 1822(12 to 5), 1853(8 to 1), 1859(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1859: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1797: 3), (1815: 2), (1816: 2), (1817: 2), (1821: 3), (1822: 2), (1853: 1), (1859: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
