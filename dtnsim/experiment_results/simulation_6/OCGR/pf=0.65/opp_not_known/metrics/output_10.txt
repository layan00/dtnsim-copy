The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 11), 227(3 to 10), 228(4 to 6), 229(7 to 9), 234(12 to 4), 235(12 to 5), 262(8 to 1), 266(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(228: 55.000000), (229: 25.000000), (266: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 5), (227: 3), (228: 4), (229: 3), (234: 3), (235: 2), (262: 1), (266: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
