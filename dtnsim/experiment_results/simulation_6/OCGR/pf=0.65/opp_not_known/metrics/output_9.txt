The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1779(1 to 11), 1797(3 to 10), 1798(4 to 6), 1799(7 to 9), 1802(12 to 4), 1803(12 to 5), 1828(8 to 1), 1833(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1779: 5), (1797: 2), (1798: 4), (1799: 3), (1802: 3), (1803: 2), (1828: 1), (1833: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 48 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
