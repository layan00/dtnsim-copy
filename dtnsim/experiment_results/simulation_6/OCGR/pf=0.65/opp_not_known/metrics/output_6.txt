The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
600(1 to 11), 617(3 to 10), 618(4 to 6), 619(7 to 9), 623(12 to 4), 624(12 to 5), 652(8 to 1), 657(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(600: 3), (617: 3), (618: 4), (619: 2), (623: 3), (624: 2), (652: 1), (657: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
