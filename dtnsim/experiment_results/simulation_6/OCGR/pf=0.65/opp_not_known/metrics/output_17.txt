The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
989(1 to 11), 1007(3 to 10), 1008(4 to 6), 1009(7 to 9), 1012(12 to 4), 1013(12 to 5), 1039(8 to 1), 1046(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(989: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(989: 3), (1007: 4), (1008: 2), (1009: 2), (1012: 3), (1013: 1), (1039: 3), (1046: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
