The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1029(1 to 11), 1050(3 to 10), 1051(4 to 6), 1052(7 to 9), 1057(12 to 4), 1058(12 to 5), 1088(8 to 1), 1092(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1050: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1029: 3), (1050: 5), (1051: 4), (1052: 2), (1057: 2), (1058: 2), (1088: 1), (1092: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
