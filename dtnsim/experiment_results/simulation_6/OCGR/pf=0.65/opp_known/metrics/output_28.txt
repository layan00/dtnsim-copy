The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1032(1 to 11), 1038(3 to 10), 1039(4 to 6), 1040(7 to 9), 1046(12 to 4), 1047(12 to 5), 1066(8 to 1), 1069(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1032: 5), (1038: 2), (1039: 4), (1040: 3), (1046: 3), (1047: 3), (1066: 2), (1069: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
