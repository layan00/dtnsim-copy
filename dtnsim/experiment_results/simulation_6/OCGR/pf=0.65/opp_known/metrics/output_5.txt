The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(1 to 11), 200(3 to 10), 201(4 to 6), 202(7 to 9), 205(12 to 4), 206(12 to 5), 222(8 to 1), 224(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(200: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 5), (200: 6), (201: 4), (202: 2), (205: 3), (206: 3), (222: 1), (224: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
