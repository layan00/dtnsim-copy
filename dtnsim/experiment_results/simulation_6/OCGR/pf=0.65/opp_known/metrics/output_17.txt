The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
739(1 to 11), 745(3 to 10), 746(4 to 6), 747(7 to 9), 750(12 to 4), 751(12 to 5), 765(8 to 1), 772(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(739: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(739: 4), (745: 4), (746: 2), (747: 2), (750: 3), (751: 3), (765: 3), (772: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
