The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1312(1 to 11), 1318(3 to 10), 1319(4 to 6), 1320(7 to 9), 1324(12 to 4), 1325(12 to 5), 1345(8 to 1), 1351(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1351: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1312: 4), (1318: 2), (1319: 2), (1320: 2), (1324: 5), (1325: 5), (1345: 1), (1351: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
