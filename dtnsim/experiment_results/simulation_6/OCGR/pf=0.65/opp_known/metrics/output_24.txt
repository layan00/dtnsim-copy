The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1340(1 to 11), 1345(3 to 10), 1346(4 to 6), 1347(7 to 9), 1349(12 to 4), 1350(12 to 5), 1364(8 to 1), 1370(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1345: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1340: 4), (1345: 4), (1346: 4), (1347: 2), (1349: 3), (1350: 3), (1364: 1), (1370: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
