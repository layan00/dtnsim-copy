The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
480(1 to 11), 485(3 to 10), 486(4 to 6), 487(7 to 9), 493(12 to 4), 494(12 to 5), 513(8 to 1), 516(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(480: 60.000000), (486: 55.000000), (487: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(480: 4), (485: 4), (486: 4), (487: 3), (493: 3), (494: 3), (513: 1), (516: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
