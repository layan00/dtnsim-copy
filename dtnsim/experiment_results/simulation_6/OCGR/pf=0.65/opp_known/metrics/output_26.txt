The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
460(1 to 11), 464(3 to 10), 465(4 to 6), 466(7 to 9), 468(12 to 4), 469(12 to 5), 484(8 to 1), 492(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(460: 4), (464: 4), (465: 4), (466: 2), (468: 4), (469: 4), (484: 2), (492: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
