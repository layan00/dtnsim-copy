The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1007(1 to 11), 1012(3 to 10), 1013(4 to 6), 1014(7 to 9), 1017(12 to 4), 1018(12 to 5), 1035(8 to 1), 1037(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1012: 55.000000), (1013: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1007: 5), (1012: 6), (1013: 4), (1014: 2), (1017: 3), (1018: 3), (1035: 2), (1037: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
