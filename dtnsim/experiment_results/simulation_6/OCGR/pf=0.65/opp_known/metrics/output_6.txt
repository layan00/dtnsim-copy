The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
469(1 to 11), 474(3 to 10), 475(4 to 6), 476(7 to 9), 480(12 to 4), 481(12 to 5), 498(8 to 1), 503(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(469: 4), (474: 4), (475: 4), (476: 2), (480: 3), (481: 3), (498: 1), (503: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
