The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1014(1 to 11), 1019(3 to 10), 1020(4 to 6), 1021(7 to 9), 1023(12 to 4), 1024(12 to 5), 1044(8 to 1), 1050(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1019: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1014: 4), (1019: 4), (1020: 4), (1021: 2), (1023: 5), (1024: 5), (1044: 1), (1050: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
