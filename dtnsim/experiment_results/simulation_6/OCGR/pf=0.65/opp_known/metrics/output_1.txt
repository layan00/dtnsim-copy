The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
475(1 to 11), 481(3 to 10), 482(4 to 6), 483(7 to 9), 486(12 to 4), 487(12 to 5), 505(8 to 1), 509(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(481: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(475: 4), (481: 4), (482: 4), (483: 2), (486: 3), (487: 3), (505: 1), (509: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
