The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 11), 203(3 to 10), 204(4 to 6), 205(7 to 9), 210(12 to 4), 211(12 to 5), 226(8 to 1), 230(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(204: 55.000000), (205: 25.000000), (230: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 5), (203: 2), (204: 4), (205: 3), (210: 3), (211: 3), (226: 1), (230: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
