The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
191(1 to 11), 195(3 to 10), 196(4 to 6), 197(7 to 9), 199(12 to 4), 200(12 to 5), 217(8 to 1), 220(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 4), (195: 2), (196: 4), (197: 2), (199: 3), (200: 3), (217: 1), (220: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
