The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1066(1 to 11), 1072(3 to 10), 1073(4 to 6), 1074(7 to 9), 1076(12 to 4), 1077(12 to 5), 1090(8 to 1), 1097(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1072: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1066: 4), (1072: 6), (1073: 3), (1074: 2), (1076: 3), (1077: 3), (1090: 1), (1097: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
