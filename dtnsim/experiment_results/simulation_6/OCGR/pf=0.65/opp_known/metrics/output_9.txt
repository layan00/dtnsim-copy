The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1291(1 to 11), 1297(3 to 10), 1298(4 to 6), 1299(7 to 9), 1302(12 to 4), 1303(12 to 5), 1316(8 to 1), 1321(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1291: 5), (1297: 2), (1298: 4), (1299: 3), (1302: 3), (1303: 3), (1316: 1), (1321: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
