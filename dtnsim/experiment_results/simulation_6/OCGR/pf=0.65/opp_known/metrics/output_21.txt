The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
504(1 to 11), 512(3 to 10), 513(4 to 6), 514(7 to 9), 518(12 to 4), 519(12 to 5), 535(8 to 1), 539(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(512: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(504: 4), (512: 4), (513: 4), (514: 2), (518: 3), (519: 3), (535: 1), (539: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
