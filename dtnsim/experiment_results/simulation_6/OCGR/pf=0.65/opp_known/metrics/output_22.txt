The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
783(1 to 11), 792(3 to 10), 793(4 to 6), 794(7 to 9), 799(12 to 4), 800(12 to 5), 818(8 to 1), 822(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(792: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(783: 4), (792: 4), (793: 4), (794: 2), (799: 3), (800: 3), (818: 1), (822: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
