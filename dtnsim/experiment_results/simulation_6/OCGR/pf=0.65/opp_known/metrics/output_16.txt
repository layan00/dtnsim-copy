The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
472(1 to 11), 478(3 to 10), 479(4 to 6), 480(7 to 9), 482(12 to 4), 483(12 to 5), 502(8 to 1), 504(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(472: 4), (478: 2), (479: 4), (480: 2), (482: 5), (483: 5), (502: 1), (504: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
