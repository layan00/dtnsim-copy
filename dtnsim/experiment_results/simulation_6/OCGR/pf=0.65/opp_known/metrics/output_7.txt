The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
743(1 to 11), 746(3 to 10), 747(4 to 6), 748(7 to 9), 752(12 to 4), 753(12 to 5), 767(8 to 1), 774(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(743: 60.000000), (774: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(743: 4), (746: 2), (747: 2), (748: 2), (752: 3), (753: 3), (767: 3), (774: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
