The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1330(1 to 11), 1336(3 to 10), 1337(4 to 6), 1338(7 to 9), 1342(12 to 4), 1343(12 to 5), 1361(8 to 1), 1365(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1336: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1330: 5), (1336: 4), (1337: 4), (1338: 3), (1342: 3), (1343: 3), (1361: 1), (1365: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
