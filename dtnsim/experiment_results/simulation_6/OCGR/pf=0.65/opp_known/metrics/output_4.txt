The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1280(1 to 11), 1286(3 to 10), 1287(4 to 6), 1288(7 to 9), 1289(12 to 4), 1290(12 to 5), 1305(8 to 1), 1319(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1280: 60.000000), (1287: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1280: 4), (1286: 4), (1287: 3), (1288: 2), (1289: 4), (1290: 4), (1305: 4), (1319: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
