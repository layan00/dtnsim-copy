The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1283(1 to 11), 1289(3 to 10), 1290(4 to 6), 1291(7 to 9), 1295(12 to 4), 1296(12 to 5), 1309(8 to 1), 1314(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1291: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1283: 4), (1289: 2), (1290: 2), (1291: 3), (1295: 3), (1296: 3), (1309: 1), (1314: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
