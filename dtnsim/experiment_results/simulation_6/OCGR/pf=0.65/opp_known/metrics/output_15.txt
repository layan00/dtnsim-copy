The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 11), 206(3 to 10), 207(4 to 6), 208(7 to 9), 210(12 to 4), 211(12 to 5), 231(8 to 1), 233(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 5), (206: 2), (207: 4), (208: 2), (210: 5), (211: 5), (231: 1), (233: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
