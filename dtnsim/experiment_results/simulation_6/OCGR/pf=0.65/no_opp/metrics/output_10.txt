The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(1 to 11), 68(3 to 10), 69(4 to 6), 70(7 to 9), 75(12 to 4), 76(12 to 5), 80(8 to 1), 84(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(70: 25.000000), (84: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 2), (68: 2), (69: 1), (70: 3), (75: 3), (76: 1), (80: 1), (84: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 66: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 66: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 68: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000),
