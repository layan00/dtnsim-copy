The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
405(1 to 11), 409(3 to 10), 410(4 to 6), 411(7 to 9), 412(12 to 4), 413(12 to 5), 417(8 to 1), 432(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(410: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(405: 3), (409: 4), (410: 3), (411: 2), (412: 4), (413: 1), (417: 4), (432: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
