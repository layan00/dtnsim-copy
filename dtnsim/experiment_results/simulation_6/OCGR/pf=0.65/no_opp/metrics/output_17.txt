The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
236(1 to 11), 240(3 to 10), 241(4 to 6), 242(7 to 9), 245(12 to 4), 246(12 to 5), 248(8 to 1), 255(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 1), (240: 4), (241: 2), (242: 2), (245: 3), (246: 1), (248: 3), (255: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
