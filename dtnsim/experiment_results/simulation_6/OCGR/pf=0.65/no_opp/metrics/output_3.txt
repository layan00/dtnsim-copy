The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
322(1 to 11), 324(3 to 10), 325(4 to 6), 326(7 to 9), 329(12 to 4), 330(12 to 5), 334(8 to 1), 336(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(322: 1), (324: 3), (325: 1), (326: 2), (329: 3), (330: 1), (334: 2), (336: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
