The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
261(1 to 11), 265(3 to 10), 266(4 to 6), 267(7 to 9), 271(12 to 4), 272(12 to 5), 273(8 to 1), 276(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(265: 35.000000), (276: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(261: 1), (265: 4), (266: 1), (267: 2), (271: 3), (272: 1), (273: 1), (276: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 261: (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
