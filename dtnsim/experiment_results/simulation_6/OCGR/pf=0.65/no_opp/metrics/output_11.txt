The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
163(1 to 11), 166(3 to 10), 167(4 to 6), 168(7 to 9), 174(12 to 4), 175(12 to 5), 182(8 to 1), 185(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(168: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(163: 1), (166: 4), (167: 1), (168: 3), (174: 3), (175: 3), (182: 1), (185: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
