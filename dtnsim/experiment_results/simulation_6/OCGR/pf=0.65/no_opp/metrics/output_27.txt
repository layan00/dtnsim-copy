The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
234(1 to 11), 238(3 to 10), 239(4 to 6), 240(7 to 9), 244(12 to 4), 245(12 to 5), 250(8 to 1), 257(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 35.000000), (244: 25.000000), (257: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(234: 1), (238: 4), (239: 1), (240: 2), (244: 4), (245: 2), (250: 1), (257: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
