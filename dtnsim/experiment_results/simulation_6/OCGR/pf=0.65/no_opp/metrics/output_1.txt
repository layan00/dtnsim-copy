The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
157(1 to 11), 161(3 to 10), 162(4 to 6), 163(7 to 9), 166(12 to 4), 167(12 to 5), 170(8 to 1), 174(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(157: 1), (161: 3), (162: 1), (163: 2), (166: 3), (167: 1), (170: 1), (174: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
