The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
59(1 to 11), 61(3 to 10), 62(4 to 6), 63(7 to 9), 65(12 to 4), 66(12 to 5), 71(8 to 1), 74(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(59: 2), (61: 2), (62: 1), (63: 2), (65: 3), (66: 1), (71: 1), (74: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 59: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 59: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 61: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 62: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7:
