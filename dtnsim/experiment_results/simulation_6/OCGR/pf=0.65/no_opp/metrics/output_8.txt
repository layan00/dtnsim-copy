The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
326(1 to 11), 329(3 to 10), 330(4 to 6), 331(7 to 9), 333(12 to 4), 334(12 to 5), 341(8 to 1), 348(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(329: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(326: 4), (329: 4), (330: 1), (331: 2), (333: 4), (334: 1), (341: 1), (348: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
