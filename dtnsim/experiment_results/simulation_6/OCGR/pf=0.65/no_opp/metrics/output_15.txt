The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(1 to 11), 70(3 to 10), 71(4 to 6), 72(7 to 9), 74(12 to 4), 75(12 to 5), 82(8 to 1), 85(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 3), (70: 2), (71: 1), (72: 2), (74: 4), (75: 1), (82: 1), (85: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 66: (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
