The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
241(1 to 11), 243(3 to 10), 244(4 to 6), 245(7 to 9), 249(12 to 4), 250(12 to 5), 252(8 to 1), 256(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(241: 1), (243: 3), (244: 2), (245: 2), (249: 3), (250: 1), (252: 1), (256: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
