The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
448(1 to 11), 451(3 to 10), 452(4 to 6), 453(7 to 9), 455(12 to 4), 456(12 to 5), 459(8 to 1), 466(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(451: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(448: 4), (451: 4), (452: 1), (453: 2), (455: 3), (456: 1), (459: 1), (466: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
