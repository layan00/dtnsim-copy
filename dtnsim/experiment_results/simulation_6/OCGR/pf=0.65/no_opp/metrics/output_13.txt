The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
356(1 to 11), 361(3 to 10), 362(4 to 6), 363(7 to 9), 370(12 to 4), 371(12 to 5), 378(8 to 1), 390(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(361: 35.000000), (362: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(356: 4), (361: 4), (362: 3), (363: 3), (370: 2), (371: 3), (378: 4), (390: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
