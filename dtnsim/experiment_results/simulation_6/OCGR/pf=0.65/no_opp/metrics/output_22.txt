The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
264(1 to 11), 271(3 to 10), 272(4 to 6), 273(7 to 9), 278(12 to 4), 279(12 to 5), 283(8 to 1), 287(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(264: 1), (271: 3), (272: 1), (273: 2), (278: 2), (279: 2), (283: 1), (287: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
