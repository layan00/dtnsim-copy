The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
148(1 to 11), 151(3 to 10), 152(4 to 6), 153(7 to 9), 157(12 to 4), 158(12 to 5), 163(8 to 1), 168(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(148: 2), (151: 3), (152: 1), (153: 2), (157: 3), (158: 1), (163: 1), (168: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 148: (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
