The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
410(1 to 11), 414(3 to 10), 415(4 to 6), 416(7 to 9), 420(12 to 4), 421(12 to 5), 422(8 to 1), 427(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(416: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(410: 1), (414: 2), (415: 2), (416: 3), (420: 3), (421: 1), (422: 1), (427: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
