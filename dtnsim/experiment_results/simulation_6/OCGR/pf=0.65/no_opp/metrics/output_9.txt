The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
417(1 to 11), 420(3 to 10), 421(4 to 6), 422(7 to 9), 425(12 to 4), 426(12 to 5), 427(8 to 1), 432(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(432: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(417: 1), (420: 2), (421: 1), (422: 3), (425: 3), (426: 1), (427: 1), (432: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
