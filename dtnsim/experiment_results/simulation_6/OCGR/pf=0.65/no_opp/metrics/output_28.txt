The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
336(1 to 11), 339(3 to 10), 340(4 to 6), 341(7 to 9), 347(12 to 4), 348(12 to 5), 355(8 to 1), 358(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(336: 2), (339: 2), (340: 1), (341: 3), (347: 2), (348: 3), (355: 2), (358: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
