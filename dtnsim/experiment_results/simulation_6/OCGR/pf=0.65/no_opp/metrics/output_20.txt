The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
72(1 to 11), 78(3 to 10), 79(4 to 6), 80(7 to 9), 84(12 to 4), 85(12 to 5), 90(8 to 1), 99(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(79: 25.000000), (84: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(72: 1), (78: 3), (79: 3), (80: 2), (84: 5), (85: 1), (90: 1), (99: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 72: (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
