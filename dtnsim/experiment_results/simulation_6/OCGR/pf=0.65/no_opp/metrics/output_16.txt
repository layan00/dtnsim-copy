The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
153(1 to 11), 157(3 to 10), 158(4 to 6), 159(7 to 9), 161(12 to 4), 162(12 to 5), 168(8 to 1), 170(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(153: 1), (157: 2), (158: 1), (159: 2), (161: 3), (162: 2), (168: 1), (170: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
