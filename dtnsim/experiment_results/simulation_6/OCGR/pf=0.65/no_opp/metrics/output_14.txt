The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
462(1 to 11), 465(3 to 10), 466(4 to 6), 467(7 to 9), 471(12 to 4), 472(12 to 5), 475(8 to 1), 479(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(462: 1), (465: 3), (466: 1), (467: 3), (471: 3), (472: 1), (475: 1), (479: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
