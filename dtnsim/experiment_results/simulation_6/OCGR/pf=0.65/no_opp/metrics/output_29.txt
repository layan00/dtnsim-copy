The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
431(1 to 11), 435(3 to 10), 436(4 to 6), 437(7 to 9), 441(12 to 4), 442(12 to 5), 450(8 to 1), 456(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(431: 2), (435: 2), (436: 2), (437: 2), (441: 3), (442: 2), (450: 1), (456: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
