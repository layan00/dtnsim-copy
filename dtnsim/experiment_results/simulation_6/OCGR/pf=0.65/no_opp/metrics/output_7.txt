The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
238(1 to 11), 239(3 to 10), 240(4 to 6), 241(7 to 9), 245(12 to 4), 246(12 to 5), 248(8 to 1), 255(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(238: 1), (239: 2), (240: 2), (241: 2), (245: 3), (246: 1), (248: 3), (255: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
