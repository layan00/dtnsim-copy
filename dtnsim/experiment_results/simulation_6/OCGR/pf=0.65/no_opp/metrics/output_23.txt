The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
359(1 to 11), 363(3 to 10), 364(4 to 6), 365(7 to 9), 367(12 to 4), 368(12 to 5), 369(8 to 1), 376(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(359: 1), (363: 3), (364: 3), (365: 2), (367: 3), (368: 1), (369: 1), (376: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
