The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
141(1 to 11), 143(3 to 10), 144(4 to 6), 145(7 to 9), 147(12 to 4), 148(12 to 5), 151(8 to 1), 159(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(141: 1), (143: 4), (144: 1), (145: 2), (147: 4), (148: 1), (151: 2), (159: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
