The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(1 to 11), 211(3 to 10), 212(4 to 6), 213(7 to 9), 220(12 to 4), 221(12 to 5), 230(8 to 1), 243(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(205: 60.000000), (211: 35.000000), (213: 25.000000), (221: 15.000000), (243: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 4), (211: 4), (212: 1), (213: 3), (220: 4), (221: 4), (230: 1), (243: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
