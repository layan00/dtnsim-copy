The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
346(1 to 11), 350(3 to 10), 351(4 to 6), 352(7 to 9), 359(12 to 4), 360(12 to 5), 368(8 to 1), 383(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(346: 60.000000), (350: 35.000000), (351: 25.000000), (383: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(346: 4), (350: 4), (351: 3), (352: 3), (359: 4), (360: 1), (368: 4), (383: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
