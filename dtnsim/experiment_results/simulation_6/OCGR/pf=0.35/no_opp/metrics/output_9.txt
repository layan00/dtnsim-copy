The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
583(1 to 11), 589(3 to 10), 590(4 to 6), 591(7 to 9), 598(12 to 4), 599(12 to 5), 602(8 to 1), 609(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(589: 25.000000), (591: 45.000000), (609: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(583: 1), (589: 5), (590: 1), (591: 3), (598: 3), (599: 1), (602: 1), (609: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
