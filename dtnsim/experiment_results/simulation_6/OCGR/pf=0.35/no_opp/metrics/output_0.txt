The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
82(1 to 11), 89(3 to 10), 90(4 to 6), 91(7 to 9), 99(12 to 4), 100(12 to 5), 108(8 to 1), 126(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 60.000000), (90: 25.000000), (91: 25.000000), (100: 15.000000), (108: 15.000000), (126: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(82: 4), (89: 3), (90: 3), (91: 3), (99: 2), (100: 4), (108: 4), (126: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
