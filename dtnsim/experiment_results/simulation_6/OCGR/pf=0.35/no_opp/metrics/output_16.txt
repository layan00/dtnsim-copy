The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
188(1 to 11), 192(3 to 10), 193(4 to 6), 194(7 to 9), 197(12 to 4), 198(12 to 5), 205(8 to 1), 212(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(188: 1), (192: 3), (193: 1), (194: 3), (197: 3), (198: 2), (205: 2), (212: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
