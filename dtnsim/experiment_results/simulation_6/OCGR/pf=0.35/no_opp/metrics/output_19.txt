The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
530(1 to 11), 537(3 to 10), 538(4 to 6), 539(7 to 9), 547(12 to 4), 548(12 to 5), 553(8 to 1), 563(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(539: 25.000000), (548: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(530: 1), (537: 3), (538: 2), (539: 3), (547: 2), (548: 4), (553: 1), (563: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
