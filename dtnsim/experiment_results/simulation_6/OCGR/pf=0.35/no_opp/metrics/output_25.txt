The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
75(1 to 11), 80(3 to 10), 81(4 to 6), 82(7 to 9), 91(12 to 4), 92(12 to 5), 102(8 to 1), 111(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 25.000000), (92: 15.000000), (111: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(75: 3), (80: 5), (81: 1), (82: 3), (91: 3), (92: 4), (102: 2), (111: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
