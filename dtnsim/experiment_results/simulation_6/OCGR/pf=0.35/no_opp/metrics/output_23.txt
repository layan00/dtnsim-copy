The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
441(1 to 11), 447(3 to 10), 448(4 to 6), 449(7 to 9), 456(12 to 4), 457(12 to 5), 464(8 to 1), 472(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(472: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(441: 2), (447: 3), (448: 3), (449: 3), (456: 2), (457: 3), (464: 1), (472: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
