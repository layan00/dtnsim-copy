The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
572(1 to 11), 577(3 to 10), 578(4 to 6), 579(7 to 9), 584(12 to 4), 585(12 to 5), 590(8 to 1), 598(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 2), (577: 3), (578: 3), (579: 3), (584: 3), (585: 1), (590: 1), (598: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
