The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
461(1 to 11), 467(3 to 10), 468(4 to 6), 469(7 to 9), 473(12 to 4), 474(12 to 5), 482(8 to 1), 494(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(461: 60.000000), (467: 35.000000), (468: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(461: 4), (467: 4), (468: 3), (469: 2), (473: 3), (474: 2), (482: 1), (494: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
