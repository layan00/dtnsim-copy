The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
476(1 to 11), 480(3 to 10), 481(4 to 6), 482(7 to 9), 487(12 to 4), 488(12 to 5), 495(8 to 1), 501(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(501: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(476: 2), (480: 3), (481: 1), (482: 2), (487: 2), (488: 2), (495: 2), (501: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
