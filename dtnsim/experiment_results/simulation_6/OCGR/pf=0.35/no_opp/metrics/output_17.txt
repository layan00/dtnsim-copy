The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
296(1 to 11), 302(3 to 10), 303(4 to 6), 304(7 to 9), 311(12 to 4), 312(12 to 5), 317(8 to 1), 325(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(302: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(296: 1), (302: 4), (303: 2), (304: 3), (311: 2), (312: 3), (317: 3), (325: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
