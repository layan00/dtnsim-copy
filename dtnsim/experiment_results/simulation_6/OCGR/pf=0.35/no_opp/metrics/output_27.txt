The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
322(1 to 11), 328(3 to 10), 329(4 to 6), 330(7 to 9), 335(12 to 4), 336(12 to 5), 345(8 to 1), 359(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(322: 60.000000), (329: 25.000000), (335: 25.000000), (345: 15.000000), (359: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(322: 4), (328: 3), (329: 3), (330: 2), (335: 4), (336: 2), (345: 4), (359: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
