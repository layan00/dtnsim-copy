The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 11), 209(3 to 10), 210(4 to 6), 211(7 to 9), 222(12 to 4), 223(12 to 5), 229(8 to 1), 237(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(211: 25.000000), (223: 15.000000), (237: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 1), (209: 5), (210: 1), (211: 3), (222: 3), (223: 4), (229: 1), (237: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
