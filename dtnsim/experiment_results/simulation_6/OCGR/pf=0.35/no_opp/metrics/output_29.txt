The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
580(1 to 11), 584(3 to 10), 585(4 to 6), 586(7 to 9), 590(12 to 4), 591(12 to 5), 600(8 to 1), 611(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(590: 25.000000), (611: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(580: 3), (584: 2), (585: 2), (586: 2), (590: 4), (591: 2), (600: 3), (611: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
