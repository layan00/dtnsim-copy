The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
565(1 to 11), 569(3 to 10), 570(4 to 6), 571(7 to 9), 575(12 to 4), 576(12 to 5), 585(8 to 1), 596(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(569: 35.000000), (571: 45.000000), (596: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(565: 4), (569: 4), (570: 1), (571: 3), (575: 4), (576: 2), (585: 2), (596: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
