The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
73(1 to 11), 78(3 to 10), 79(4 to 6), 80(7 to 9), 87(12 to 4), 88(12 to 5), 95(8 to 1), 100(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(73: 60.000000), (78: 25.000000), (87: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(73: 4), (78: 5), (79: 1), (80: 3), (87: 5), (88: 1), (95: 1), (100: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
