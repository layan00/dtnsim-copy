The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
336(1 to 11), 338(3 to 10), 339(4 to 6), 340(7 to 9), 345(12 to 4), 346(12 to 5), 352(8 to 1), 364(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(352: 15.000000), (364: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(336: 1), (338: 3), (339: 3), (340: 3), (345: 2), (346: 3), (352: 4), (364: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
