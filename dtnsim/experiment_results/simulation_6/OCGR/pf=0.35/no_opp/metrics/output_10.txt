The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
74(1 to 11), 78(3 to 10), 79(4 to 6), 80(7 to 9), 86(12 to 4), 87(12 to 5), 92(8 to 1), 107(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(74: 60.000000), (78: 35.000000), (79: 25.000000), (80: 25.000000), (107: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(74: 4), (78: 4), (79: 3), (80: 3), (86: 3), (87: 1), (92: 4), (107: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
