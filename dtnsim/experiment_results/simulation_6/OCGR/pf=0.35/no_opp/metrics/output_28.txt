The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
457(1 to 11), 460(3 to 10), 461(4 to 6), 462(7 to 9), 469(12 to 4), 470(12 to 5), 480(8 to 1), 487(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(462: 25.000000), (469: 25.000000), (487: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(457: 2), (460: 2), (461: 1), (462: 3), (469: 4), (470: 4), (480: 2), (487: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
