The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
319(1 to 11), 327(3 to 10), 328(4 to 6), 329(7 to 9), 338(12 to 4), 339(12 to 5), 343(8 to 1), 354(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(327: 25.000000), (328: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(319: 1), (327: 5), (328: 3), (329: 2), (338: 2), (339: 2), (343: 1), (354: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
