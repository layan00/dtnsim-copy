The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 11), 88(3 to 10), 89(4 to 6), 90(7 to 9), 97(12 to 4), 98(12 to 5), 105(8 to 1), 115(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(89: 25.000000), (97: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 4), (88: 3), (89: 3), (90: 3), (97: 5), (98: 1), (105: 1), (115: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
