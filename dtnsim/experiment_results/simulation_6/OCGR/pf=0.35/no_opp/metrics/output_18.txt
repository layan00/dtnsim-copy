The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
413(1 to 11), 418(3 to 10), 419(4 to 6), 420(7 to 9), 425(12 to 4), 426(12 to 5), 434(8 to 1), 441(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(441: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(413: 2), (418: 3), (419: 1), (420: 2), (425: 5), (426: 1), (434: 2), (441: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
