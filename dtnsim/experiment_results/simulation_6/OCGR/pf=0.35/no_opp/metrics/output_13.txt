The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
440(1 to 11), 447(3 to 10), 448(4 to 6), 449(7 to 9), 460(12 to 4), 461(12 to 5), 470(8 to 1), 484(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(448: 25.000000), (449: 25.000000), (460: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(440: 4), (447: 5), (448: 3), (449: 3), (460: 4), (461: 4), (470: 4), (484: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
