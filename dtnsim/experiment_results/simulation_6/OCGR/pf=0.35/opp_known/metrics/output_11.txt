The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
511(1 to 11), 517(3 to 10), 518(4 to 6), 519(7 to 9), 527(12 to 4), 528(12 to 5), 548(8 to 1), 553(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(511: 60.000000), (517: 35.000000), (518: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(511: 4), (517: 4), (518: 4), (519: 3), (527: 3), (528: 3), (548: 2), (553: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
