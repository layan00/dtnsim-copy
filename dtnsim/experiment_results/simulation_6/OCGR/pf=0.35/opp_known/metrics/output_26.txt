The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
520(1 to 11), 526(3 to 10), 527(4 to 6), 528(7 to 9), 533(12 to 4), 534(12 to 5), 554(8 to 1), 571(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 25.000000), (528: 25.000000), (554: 15.000000), (571: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(520: 4), (526: 4), (527: 3), (528: 3), (533: 5), (534: 5), (554: 4), (571: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
