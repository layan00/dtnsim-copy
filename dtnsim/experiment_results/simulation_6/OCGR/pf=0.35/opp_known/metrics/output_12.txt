The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
814(1 to 11), 822(3 to 10), 823(4 to 6), 824(7 to 9), 829(12 to 4), 830(12 to 5), 848(8 to 1), 853(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(822: 15.000000), (823: 55.000000), (824: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(814: 4), (822: 4), (823: 4), (824: 3), (829: 3), (830: 3), (848: 1), (853: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
