The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1142(1 to 11), 1153(3 to 10), 1154(4 to 6), 1155(7 to 9), 1162(12 to 4), 1163(12 to 5), 1182(8 to 1), 1190(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1142: 20.000000), (1153: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1142: 5), (1153: 6), (1154: 3), (1155: 3), (1162: 3), (1163: 3), (1182: 1), (1190: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
