The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
540(1 to 11), 547(3 to 10), 548(4 to 6), 549(7 to 9), 555(12 to 4), 556(12 to 5), 578(8 to 1), 583(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(540: 60.000000), (547: 15.000000), (548: 55.000000), (549: 45.000000), (555: 85.000000), (556: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(540: 4), (547: 4), (548: 4), (549: 3), (555: 9), (556: 11), (578: 1), (583: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
