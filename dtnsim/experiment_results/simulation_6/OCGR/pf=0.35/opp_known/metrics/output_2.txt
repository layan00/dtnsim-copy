The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
859(1 to 11), 865(3 to 10), 866(4 to 6), 867(7 to 9), 874(12 to 4), 875(12 to 5), 896(8 to 1), 910(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(859: 60.000000), (865: 35.000000), (866: 25.000000), (910: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(859: 4), (865: 4), (866: 3), (867: 3), (874: 8), (875: 8), (896: 4), (910: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
