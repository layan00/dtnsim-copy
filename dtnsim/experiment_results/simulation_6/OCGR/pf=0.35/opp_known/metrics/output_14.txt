The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1438(1 to 11), 1446(3 to 10), 1447(4 to 6), 1448(7 to 9), 1453(12 to 4), 1454(12 to 5), 1473(8 to 1), 1483(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1446: 15.000000), (1483: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1438: 7), (1446: 4), (1447: 3), (1448: 3), (1453: 3), (1454: 3), (1473: 1), (1483: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
