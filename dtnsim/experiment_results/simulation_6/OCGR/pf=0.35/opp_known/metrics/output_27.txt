The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
830(1 to 11), 838(3 to 10), 839(4 to 6), 840(7 to 9), 845(12 to 4), 846(12 to 5), 869(8 to 1), 882(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(830: 60.000000), (838: 15.000000), (839: 25.000000), (845: 25.000000), (846: 45.000000), (869: 15.000000), (882: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(830: 4), (838: 4), (839: 3), (840: 2), (845: 5), (846: 7), (869: 4), (882: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
