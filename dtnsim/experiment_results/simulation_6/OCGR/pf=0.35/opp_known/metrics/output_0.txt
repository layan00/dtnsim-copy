The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 11), 223(3 to 10), 224(4 to 6), 225(7 to 9), 233(12 to 4), 234(12 to 5), 256(8 to 1), 277(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 60.000000), (223: 15.000000), (224: 25.000000), (225: 25.000000), (233: 15.000000), (234: 15.000000), (256: 15.000000), (277: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 4), (223: 4), (224: 3), (225: 3), (233: 6), (234: 4), (256: 4), (277: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
