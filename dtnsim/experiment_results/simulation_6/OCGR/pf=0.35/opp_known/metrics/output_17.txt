The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
815(1 to 11), 823(3 to 10), 824(4 to 6), 825(7 to 9), 832(12 to 4), 833(12 to 5), 851(8 to 1), 859(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(815: 60.000000), (823: 35.000000), (859: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(815: 4), (823: 4), (824: 2), (825: 3), (832: 3), (833: 3), (851: 3), (859: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
