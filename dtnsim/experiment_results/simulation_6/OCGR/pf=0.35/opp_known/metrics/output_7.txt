The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
847(1 to 11), 851(3 to 10), 852(4 to 6), 853(7 to 9), 858(12 to 4), 859(12 to 5), 878(8 to 1), 890(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(847: 60.000000), (851: 55.000000), (878: 15.000000), (890: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(847: 4), (851: 6), (852: 3), (853: 3), (858: 3), (859: 3), (878: 4), (890: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
