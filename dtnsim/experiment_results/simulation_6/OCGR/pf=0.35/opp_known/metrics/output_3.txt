The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1176(1 to 11), 1184(3 to 10), 1185(4 to 6), 1186(7 to 9), 1191(12 to 4), 1192(12 to 5), 1210(8 to 1), 1216(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1184: 55.000000), (1185: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1176: 5), (1184: 6), (1185: 4), (1186: 2), (1191: 3), (1192: 3), (1210: 2), (1216: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
