The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
837(1 to 11), 847(3 to 10), 848(4 to 6), 849(7 to 9), 856(12 to 4), 857(12 to 5), 875(8 to 1), 885(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(847: 15.000000), (848: 25.000000), (885: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(837: 4), (847: 4), (848: 3), (849: 2), (856: 3), (857: 3), (875: 1), (885: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
