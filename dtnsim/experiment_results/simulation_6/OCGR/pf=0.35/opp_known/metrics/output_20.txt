The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 11), 225(3 to 10), 226(4 to 6), 227(7 to 9), 234(12 to 4), 235(12 to 5), 257(8 to 1), 266(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 20.000000), (225: 15.000000), (226: 25.000000), (234: 25.000000), (235: 45.000000), (266: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 5), (225: 4), (226: 3), (227: 3), (234: 5), (235: 7), (257: 1), (266: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
