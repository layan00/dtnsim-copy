The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1523(1 to 11), 1546(3 to 10), 1547(4 to 6), 1548(7 to 9), 1552(12 to 4), 1553(12 to 5), 1584(8 to 1), 1595(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1523: 20.000000), (1546: 35.000000), (1547: 25.000000), (1595: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1523: 5), (1546: 4), (1547: 3), (1548: 2), (1552: 3), (1553: 2), (1584: 1), (1595: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
