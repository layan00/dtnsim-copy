The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1477(1 to 11), 1496(3 to 10), 1497(4 to 6), 1498(7 to 9), 1503(12 to 4), 1504(12 to 5), 1535(8 to 1), 1542(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1477: 60.000000), (1496: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1477: 3), (1496: 6), (1497: 4), (1498: 2), (1503: 5), (1504: 2), (1535: 2), (1542: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 45 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
