The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1941(1 to 11), 1960(3 to 10), 1961(4 to 6), 1962(7 to 9), 1966(12 to 4), 1967(12 to 5), 1999(8 to 1), 2010(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1966: 25.000000), (2010: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1941: 6), (1960: 2), (1961: 2), (1962: 2), (1966: 4), (1967: 2), (1999: 3), (2010: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
