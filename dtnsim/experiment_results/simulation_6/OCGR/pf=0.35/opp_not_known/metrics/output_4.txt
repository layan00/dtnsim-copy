The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1948(1 to 11), 1967(3 to 10), 1968(4 to 6), 1969(7 to 9), 1972(12 to 4), 1973(12 to 5), 2003(8 to 1), 2018(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1948: 60.000000), (1967: 35.000000), (1968: 25.000000), (1969: 45.000000), (2003: 15.000000), (2018: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1948: 3), (1967: 4), (1968: 3), (1969: 3), (1972: 2), (1973: 2), (2003: 4), (2018: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
