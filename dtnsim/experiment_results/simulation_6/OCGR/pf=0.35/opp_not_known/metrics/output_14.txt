The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1932(1 to 11), 1952(3 to 10), 1953(4 to 6), 1954(7 to 9), 1959(12 to 4), 1960(12 to 5), 1990(8 to 1), 2000(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1952: 15.000000), (2000: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1932: 8), (1952: 5), (1953: 3), (1954: 3), (1959: 3), (1960: 2), (1990: 1), (2000: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
