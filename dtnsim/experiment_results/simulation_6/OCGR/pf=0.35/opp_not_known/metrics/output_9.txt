The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1950(1 to 11), 1971(3 to 10), 1972(4 to 6), 1973(7 to 9), 1980(12 to 4), 1981(12 to 5), 2008(8 to 1), 2015(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1971: 25.000000), (1973: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1950: 5), (1971: 5), (1972: 4), (1973: 3), (1980: 3), (1981: 2), (2008: 1), (2015: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 45 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
