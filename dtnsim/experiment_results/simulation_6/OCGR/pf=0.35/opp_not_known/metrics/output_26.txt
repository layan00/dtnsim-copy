The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
647(1 to 11), 665(3 to 10), 666(4 to 6), 667(7 to 9), 672(12 to 4), 673(12 to 5), 703(8 to 1), 720(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(666: 25.000000), (667: 25.000000), (703: 15.000000), (720: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(647: 3), (665: 4), (666: 3), (667: 3), (672: 4), (673: 1), (703: 4), (720: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
