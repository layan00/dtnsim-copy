The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 11), 238(3 to 10), 239(4 to 6), 240(7 to 9), 247(12 to 4), 248(12 to 5), 278(8 to 1), 282(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 25.000000), (239: 55.000000), (247: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 5), (238: 5), (239: 4), (240: 3), (247: 5), (248: 1), (278: 1), (282: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
