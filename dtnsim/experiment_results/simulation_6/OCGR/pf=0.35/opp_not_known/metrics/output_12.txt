The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1068(1 to 11), 1088(3 to 10), 1089(4 to 6), 1090(7 to 9), 1095(12 to 4), 1096(12 to 5), 1125(8 to 1), 1130(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1088: 15.000000), (1089: 55.000000), (1090: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1068: 3), (1088: 5), (1089: 4), (1090: 3), (1095: 3), (1096: 2), (1125: 1), (1130: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
