The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1902(1 to 11), 1923(3 to 10), 1924(4 to 6), 1925(7 to 9), 1933(12 to 4), 1934(12 to 5), 1965(8 to 1), 1975(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1923: 15.000000), (1925: 25.000000), (1934: 15.000000), (1975: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1902: 3), (1923: 5), (1924: 2), (1925: 3), (1933: 2), (1934: 4), (1965: 1), (1975: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
