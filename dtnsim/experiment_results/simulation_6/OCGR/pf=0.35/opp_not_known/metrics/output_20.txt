The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 11), 249(3 to 10), 250(4 to 6), 251(7 to 9), 258(12 to 4), 259(12 to 5), 291(8 to 1), 300(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 20.000000), (249: 15.000000), (250: 25.000000), (258: 25.000000), (300: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 5), (249: 5), (250: 3), (251: 3), (258: 5), (259: 2), (291: 1), (300: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
