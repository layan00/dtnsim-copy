The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1094(1 to 11), 1112(3 to 10), 1113(4 to 6), 1114(7 to 9), 1121(12 to 4), 1122(12 to 5), 1153(8 to 1), 1167(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1094: 60.000000), (1112: 35.000000), (1113: 25.000000), (1167: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1094: 3), (1112: 4), (1113: 3), (1114: 3), (1121: 4), (1122: 2), (1153: 4), (1167: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
