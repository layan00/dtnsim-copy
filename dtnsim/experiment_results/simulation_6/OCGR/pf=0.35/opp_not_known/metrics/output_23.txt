The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1505(1 to 11), 1528(3 to 10), 1529(4 to 6), 1530(7 to 9), 1537(12 to 4), 1538(12 to 5), 1568(8 to 1), 1576(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1505: 20.000000), (1528: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1505: 5), (1528: 6), (1529: 3), (1530: 3), (1537: 2), (1538: 3), (1568: 1), (1576: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
