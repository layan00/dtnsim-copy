The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1054(1 to 11), 1074(3 to 10), 1075(4 to 6), 1076(7 to 9), 1083(12 to 4), 1084(12 to 5), 1113(8 to 1), 1121(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1054: 60.000000), (1074: 35.000000), (1121: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1054: 3), (1074: 4), (1075: 2), (1076: 3), (1083: 2), (1084: 3), (1113: 3), (1121: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
