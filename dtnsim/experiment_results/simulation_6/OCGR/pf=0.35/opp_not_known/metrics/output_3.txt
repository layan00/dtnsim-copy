The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1523(1 to 11), 1543(3 to 10), 1544(4 to 6), 1545(7 to 9), 1550(12 to 4), 1551(12 to 5), 1581(8 to 1), 1587(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1543: 55.000000), (1544: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1523: 5), (1543: 6), (1544: 4), (1545: 2), (1550: 2), (1551: 2), (1581: 2), (1587: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
