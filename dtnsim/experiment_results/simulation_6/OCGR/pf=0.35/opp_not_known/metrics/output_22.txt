The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1079(1 to 11), 1101(3 to 10), 1102(4 to 6), 1103(7 to 9), 1112(12 to 4), 1113(12 to 5), 1141(8 to 1), 1152(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1101: 25.000000), (1102: 25.000000), (1152: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1079: 3), (1101: 5), (1102: 3), (1103: 2), (1112: 2), (1113: 2), (1141: 1), (1152: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
