The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
635(1 to 11), 653(3 to 10), 654(4 to 6), 655(7 to 9), 658(12 to 4), 659(12 to 5), 690(8 to 1), 697(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(635: 60.000000), (653: 55.000000), (654: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(635: 3), (653: 6), (654: 4), (655: 3), (658: 3), (659: 2), (690: 2), (697: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
