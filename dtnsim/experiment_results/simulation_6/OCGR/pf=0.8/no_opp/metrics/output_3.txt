The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
291(1 to 11), 293(3 to 10), 294(4 to 6), 295(7 to 9), 298(12 to 4), 299(12 to 5), 301(8 to 1), 303(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(291: 1), (293: 3), (294: 1), (295: 2), (298: 3), (299: 1), (301: 2), (303: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
