The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
279(1 to 11), 282(3 to 10), 283(4 to 6), 284(7 to 9), 286(12 to 4), 287(12 to 5), 291(8 to 1), 297(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(279: 1), (282: 3), (283: 1), (284: 2), (286: 3), (287: 1), (291: 2), (297: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
