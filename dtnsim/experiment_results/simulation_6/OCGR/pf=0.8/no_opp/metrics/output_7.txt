The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(1 to 11), 217(3 to 10), 218(4 to 6), 219(7 to 9), 222(12 to 4), 223(12 to 5), 225(8 to 1), 231(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 1), (217: 2), (218: 2), (219: 2), (222: 3), (223: 1), (225: 3), (231: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
