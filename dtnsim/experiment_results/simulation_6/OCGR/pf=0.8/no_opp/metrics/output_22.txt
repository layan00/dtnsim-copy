The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(1 to 11), 220(3 to 10), 221(4 to 6), 222(7 to 9), 224(12 to 4), 225(12 to 5), 229(8 to 1), 232(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 1), (220: 2), (221: 1), (222: 2), (224: 2), (225: 2), (229: 1), (232: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
