The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
366(1 to 11), 367(3 to 10), 368(4 to 6), 369(7 to 9), 370(12 to 4), 371(12 to 5), 374(8 to 1), 381(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(366: 3), (367: 4), (368: 1), (369: 2), (370: 3), (371: 1), (374: 1), (381: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
