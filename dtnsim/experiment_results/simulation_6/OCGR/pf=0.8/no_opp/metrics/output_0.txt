The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
61(1 to 11), 64(3 to 10), 65(4 to 6), 66(7 to 9), 72(12 to 4), 73(12 to 5), 74(8 to 1), 83(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(66: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(61: 1), (64: 4), (65: 2), (66: 3), (72: 3), (73: 1), (74: 1), (83: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 61: (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
