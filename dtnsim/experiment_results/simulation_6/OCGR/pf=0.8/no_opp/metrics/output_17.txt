The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
204(1 to 11), 208(3 to 10), 209(4 to 6), 210(7 to 9), 212(12 to 4), 213(12 to 5), 214(8 to 1), 219(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(204: 1), (208: 4), (209: 2), (210: 2), (212: 3), (213: 1), (214: 1), (219: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
