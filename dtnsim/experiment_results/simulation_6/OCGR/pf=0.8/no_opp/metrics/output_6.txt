The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
138(1 to 11), 141(3 to 10), 142(4 to 6), 143(7 to 9), 144(12 to 4), 145(12 to 5), 150(8 to 1), 154(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(138: 2), (141: 3), (142: 1), (143: 2), (144: 3), (145: 1), (150: 1), (154: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 138: (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
