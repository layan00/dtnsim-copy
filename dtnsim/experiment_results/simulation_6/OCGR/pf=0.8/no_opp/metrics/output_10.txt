The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
57(1 to 11), 58(3 to 10), 59(4 to 6), 60(7 to 9), 61(12 to 4), 62(12 to 5), 63(8 to 1), 65(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(65: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(57: 1), (58: 2), (59: 1), (60: 2), (61: 3), (62: 1), (63: 1), (65: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
