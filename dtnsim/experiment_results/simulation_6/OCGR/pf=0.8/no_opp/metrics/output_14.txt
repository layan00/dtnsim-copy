The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
372(1 to 11), 374(3 to 10), 375(4 to 6), 376(7 to 9), 378(12 to 4), 379(12 to 5), 380(8 to 1), 384(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(372: 1), (374: 3), (375: 1), (376: 3), (378: 3), (379: 1), (380: 1), (384: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
