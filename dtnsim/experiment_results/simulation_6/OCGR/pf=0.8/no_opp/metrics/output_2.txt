The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
219(1 to 11), 221(3 to 10), 222(4 to 6), 223(7 to 9), 226(12 to 4), 227(12 to 5), 228(8 to 1), 232(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(219: 1), (221: 3), (222: 2), (223: 2), (226: 3), (227: 1), (228: 1), (232: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
