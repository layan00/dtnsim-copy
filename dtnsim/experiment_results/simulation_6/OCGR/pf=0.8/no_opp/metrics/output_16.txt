The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
135(1 to 11), 137(3 to 10), 138(4 to 6), 139(7 to 9), 141(12 to 4), 142(12 to 5), 145(8 to 1), 146(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(135: 1), (137: 2), (138: 1), (139: 2), (141: 2), (142: 2), (145: 1), (146: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
