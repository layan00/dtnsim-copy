The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
369(1 to 11), 372(3 to 10), 373(4 to 6), 374(7 to 9), 376(12 to 4), 377(12 to 5), 378(8 to 1), 381(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(369: 1), (372: 2), (373: 1), (374: 2), (376: 3), (377: 1), (378: 1), (381: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
