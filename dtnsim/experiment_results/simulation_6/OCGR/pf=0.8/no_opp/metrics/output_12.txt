The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 11), 215(3 to 10), 216(4 to 6), 217(7 to 9), 219(12 to 4), 220(12 to 5), 221(8 to 1), 224(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 1), (215: 4), (216: 1), (217: 2), (219: 3), (220: 1), (221: 1), (224: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 212: (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
