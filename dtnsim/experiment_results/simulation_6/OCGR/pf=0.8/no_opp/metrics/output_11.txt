The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
132(1 to 11), 134(3 to 10), 135(4 to 6), 136(7 to 9), 139(12 to 4), 140(12 to 5), 146(8 to 1), 148(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(132: 1), (134: 2), (135: 1), (136: 2), (139: 3), (140: 2), (146: 1), (148: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
