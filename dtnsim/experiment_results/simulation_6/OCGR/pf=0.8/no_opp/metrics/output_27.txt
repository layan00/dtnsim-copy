The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
199(1 to 11), 202(3 to 10), 203(4 to 6), 204(7 to 9), 207(12 to 4), 208(12 to 5), 210(8 to 1), 215(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 35.000000), (215: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(199: 1), (202: 4), (203: 1), (204: 2), (207: 3), (208: 1), (210: 1), (215: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
