The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
290(1 to 11), 292(3 to 10), 293(4 to 6), 294(7 to 9), 297(12 to 4), 298(12 to 5), 300(8 to 1), 311(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(292: 35.000000), (293: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(290: 1), (292: 4), (293: 3), (294: 2), (297: 3), (298: 1), (300: 4), (311: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
