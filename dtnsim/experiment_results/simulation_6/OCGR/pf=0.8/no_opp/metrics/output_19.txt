The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
353(1 to 11), 356(3 to 10), 357(4 to 6), 358(7 to 9), 362(12 to 4), 363(12 to 5), 364(8 to 1), 365(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(353: 1), (356: 2), (357: 1), (358: 3), (362: 3), (363: 1), (364: 1), (365: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
