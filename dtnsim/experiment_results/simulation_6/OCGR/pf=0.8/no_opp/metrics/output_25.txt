The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
53(1 to 11), 54(3 to 10), 55(4 to 6), 56(7 to 9), 58(12 to 4), 59(12 to 5), 62(8 to 1), 64(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(53: 2), (54: 2), (55: 1), (56: 2), (58: 3), (59: 1), (62: 1), (64: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 53: (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
