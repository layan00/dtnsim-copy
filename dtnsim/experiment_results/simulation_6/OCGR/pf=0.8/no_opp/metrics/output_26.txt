The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
121(1 to 11), 122(3 to 10), 123(4 to 6), 124(7 to 9), 126(12 to 4), 127(12 to 5), 129(8 to 1), 132(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(121: 1), (122: 2), (123: 1), (124: 2), (126: 4), (127: 1), (129: 2), (132: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
