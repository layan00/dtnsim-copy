The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1236(1 to 11), 1242(3 to 10), 1243(4 to 6), 1244(7 to 9), 1245(12 to 4), 1246(12 to 5), 1260(8 to 1), 1271(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1243: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1236: 4), (1242: 4), (1243: 3), (1244: 2), (1245: 3), (1246: 3), (1260: 1), (1271: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
