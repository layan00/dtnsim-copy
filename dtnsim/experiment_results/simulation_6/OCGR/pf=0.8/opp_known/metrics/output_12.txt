The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
716(1 to 11), 721(3 to 10), 722(4 to 6), 723(7 to 9), 725(12 to 4), 726(12 to 5), 739(8 to 1), 742(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(721: 35.000000), (722: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(716: 4), (721: 4), (722: 4), (723: 2), (725: 3), (726: 3), (739: 1), (742: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
