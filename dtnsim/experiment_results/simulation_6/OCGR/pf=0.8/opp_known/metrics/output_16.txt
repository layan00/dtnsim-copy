The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
453(1 to 11), 457(3 to 10), 458(4 to 6), 459(7 to 9), 461(12 to 4), 462(12 to 5), 477(8 to 1), 478(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(453: 4), (457: 2), (458: 4), (459: 2), (461: 3), (462: 3), (477: 1), (478: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
