The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
450(1 to 11), 454(3 to 10), 455(4 to 6), 456(7 to 9), 459(12 to 4), 460(12 to 5), 479(8 to 1), 481(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(455: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(450: 4), (454: 2), (455: 4), (456: 2), (459: 5), (460: 5), (479: 1), (481: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
