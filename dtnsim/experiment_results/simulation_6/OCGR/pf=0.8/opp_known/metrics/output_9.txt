The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1246(1 to 11), 1251(3 to 10), 1252(4 to 6), 1253(7 to 9), 1255(12 to 4), 1256(12 to 5), 1269(8 to 1), 1272(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1246: 4), (1251: 2), (1252: 4), (1253: 2), (1255: 3), (1256: 3), (1269: 1), (1272: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
