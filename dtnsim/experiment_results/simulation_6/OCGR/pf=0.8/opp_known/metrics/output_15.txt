The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(1 to 11), 201(3 to 10), 202(4 to 6), 203(7 to 9), 204(12 to 4), 205(12 to 5), 225(8 to 1), 227(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 5), (201: 2), (202: 4), (203: 2), (204: 5), (205: 5), (225: 1), (227: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
