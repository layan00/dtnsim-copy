The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
964(1 to 11), 969(3 to 10), 970(4 to 6), 971(7 to 9), 973(12 to 4), 974(12 to 5), 991(8 to 1), 997(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(964: 4), (969: 4), (970: 4), (971: 2), (973: 3), (974: 3), (991: 2), (997: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
