The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
459(1 to 11), 464(3 to 10), 465(4 to 6), 466(7 to 9), 467(12 to 4), 468(12 to 5), 485(8 to 1), 489(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(459: 4), (464: 4), (465: 4), (466: 2), (467: 3), (468: 3), (485: 1), (489: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
