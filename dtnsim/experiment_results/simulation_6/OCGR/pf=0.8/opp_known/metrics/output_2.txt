The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
723(1 to 11), 727(3 to 10), 728(4 to 6), 729(7 to 9), 732(12 to 4), 733(12 to 5), 746(8 to 1), 750(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(723: 4), (727: 4), (728: 2), (729: 2), (732: 3), (733: 3), (746: 1), (750: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
