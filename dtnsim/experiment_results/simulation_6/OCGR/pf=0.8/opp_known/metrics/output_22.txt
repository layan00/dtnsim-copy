The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
720(1 to 11), 726(3 to 10), 727(4 to 6), 728(7 to 9), 730(12 to 4), 731(12 to 5), 747(8 to 1), 750(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(720: 4), (726: 2), (727: 4), (728: 2), (730: 3), (731: 3), (747: 1), (750: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
