The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
977(1 to 11), 981(3 to 10), 982(4 to 6), 983(7 to 9), 986(12 to 4), 987(12 to 5), 1001(8 to 1), 1003(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(977: 4), (981: 4), (982: 4), (983: 2), (986: 3), (987: 3), (1001: 2), (1003: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
