The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(1 to 11), 193(3 to 10), 194(4 to 6), 195(7 to 9), 196(12 to 4), 197(12 to 5), 210(8 to 1), 212(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(194: 55.000000), (212: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 5), (193: 2), (194: 4), (195: 2), (196: 3), (197: 3), (210: 1), (212: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
