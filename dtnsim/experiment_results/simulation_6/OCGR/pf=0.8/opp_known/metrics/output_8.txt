The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
980(1 to 11), 984(3 to 10), 985(4 to 6), 986(7 to 9), 988(12 to 4), 989(12 to 5), 1006(8 to 1), 1010(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(984: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(980: 4), (984: 6), (985: 4), (986: 2), (988: 3), (989: 3), (1006: 1), (1010: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
