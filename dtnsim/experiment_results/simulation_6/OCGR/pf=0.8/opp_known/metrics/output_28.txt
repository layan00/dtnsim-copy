The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
973(1 to 11), 979(3 to 10), 980(4 to 6), 981(7 to 9), 987(12 to 4), 988(12 to 5), 1005(8 to 1), 1007(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(973: 5), (979: 2), (980: 4), (981: 3), (987: 3), (988: 3), (1005: 1), (1007: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
