The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
461(1 to 11), 465(3 to 10), 466(4 to 6), 467(7 to 9), 468(12 to 4), 469(12 to 5), 483(8 to 1), 486(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(461: 4), (465: 2), (466: 4), (467: 2), (468: 3), (469: 3), (483: 1), (486: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
