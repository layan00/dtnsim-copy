The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
463(1 to 11), 469(3 to 10), 470(4 to 6), 471(7 to 9), 474(12 to 4), 475(12 to 5), 493(8 to 1), 495(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(469: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(463: 4), (469: 4), (470: 4), (471: 2), (474: 3), (475: 3), (493: 1), (495: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
