The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(1 to 11), 188(3 to 10), 189(4 to 6), 190(7 to 9), 192(12 to 4), 193(12 to 5), 207(8 to 1), 209(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 4), (188: 2), (189: 4), (190: 2), (192: 3), (193: 3), (207: 1), (209: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
