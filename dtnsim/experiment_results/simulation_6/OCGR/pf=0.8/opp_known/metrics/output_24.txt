The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1240(1 to 11), 1243(3 to 10), 1244(4 to 6), 1245(7 to 9), 1246(12 to 4), 1247(12 to 5), 1261(8 to 1), 1267(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1240: 4), (1243: 4), (1244: 4), (1245: 2), (1246: 3), (1247: 3), (1261: 1), (1267: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
