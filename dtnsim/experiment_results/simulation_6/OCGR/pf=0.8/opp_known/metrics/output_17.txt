The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
706(1 to 11), 712(3 to 10), 713(4 to 6), 714(7 to 9), 716(12 to 4), 717(12 to 5), 730(8 to 1), 735(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(706: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(706: 4), (712: 4), (713: 2), (714: 2), (716: 3), (717: 3), (730: 1), (735: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
