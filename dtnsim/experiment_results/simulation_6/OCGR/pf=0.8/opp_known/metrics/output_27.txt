The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
702(1 to 11), 707(3 to 10), 708(4 to 6), 709(7 to 9), 712(12 to 4), 713(12 to 5), 727(8 to 1), 732(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(702: 60.000000), (707: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(702: 4), (707: 4), (708: 4), (709: 2), (712: 3), (713: 3), (727: 1), (732: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
