The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
191(1 to 11), 197(3 to 10), 198(4 to 6), 199(7 to 9), 202(12 to 4), 203(12 to 5), 219(8 to 1), 220(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(197: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 5), (197: 6), (198: 4), (199: 2), (202: 3), (203: 3), (219: 1), (220: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
