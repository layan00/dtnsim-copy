The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
971(1 to 11), 986(3 to 10), 987(4 to 6), 988(7 to 9), 991(12 to 4), 992(12 to 5), 1018(8 to 1), 1024(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(971: 3), (986: 2), (987: 2), (988: 2), (991: 3), (992: 1), (1018: 3), (1024: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
