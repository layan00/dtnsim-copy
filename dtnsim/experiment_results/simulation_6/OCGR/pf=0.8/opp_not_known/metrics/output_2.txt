The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
974(1 to 11), 990(3 to 10), 991(4 to 6), 992(7 to 9), 995(12 to 4), 996(12 to 5), 1021(8 to 1), 1025(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(974: 3), (990: 3), (991: 2), (992: 2), (995: 3), (996: 1), (1021: 1), (1025: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
