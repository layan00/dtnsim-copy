The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 11), 221(3 to 10), 222(4 to 6), 223(7 to 9), 226(12 to 4), 227(12 to 5), 254(8 to 1), 255(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 5), (221: 6), (222: 4), (223: 2), (226: 3), (227: 1), (254: 1), (255: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
