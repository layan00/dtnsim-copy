The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1348(1 to 11), 1366(3 to 10), 1367(4 to 6), 1368(7 to 9), 1374(12 to 4), 1375(12 to 5), 1403(8 to 1), 1405(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1348: 5), (1366: 2), (1367: 4), (1368: 3), (1374: 2), (1375: 3), (1403: 1), (1405: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
