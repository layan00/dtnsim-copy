The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1350(1 to 11), 1366(3 to 10), 1367(4 to 6), 1368(7 to 9), 1371(12 to 4), 1372(12 to 5), 1398(8 to 1), 1409(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1366: 35.000000), (1367: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1350: 3), (1366: 4), (1367: 3), (1368: 2), (1371: 3), (1372: 1), (1398: 4), (1409: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
