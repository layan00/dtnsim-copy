The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 11), 225(3 to 10), 226(4 to 6), 227(7 to 9), 230(12 to 4), 231(12 to 5), 260(8 to 1), 267(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 15.000000), (226: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 3), (225: 5), (226: 3), (227: 2), (230: 3), (231: 2), (260: 1), (267: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
