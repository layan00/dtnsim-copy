The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
590(1 to 11), 607(3 to 10), 608(4 to 6), 609(7 to 9), 610(12 to 4), 611(12 to 5), 639(8 to 1), 643(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(590: 3), (607: 3), (608: 4), (609: 2), (610: 3), (611: 1), (639: 1), (643: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
