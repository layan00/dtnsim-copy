The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1350(1 to 11), 1366(3 to 10), 1367(4 to 6), 1368(7 to 9), 1370(12 to 4), 1371(12 to 5), 1399(8 to 1), 1403(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1366: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1350: 3), (1366: 6), (1367: 4), (1368: 2), (1370: 3), (1371: 1), (1399: 1), (1403: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 44 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
