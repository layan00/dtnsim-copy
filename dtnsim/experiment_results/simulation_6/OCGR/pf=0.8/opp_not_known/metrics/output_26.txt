The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
568(1 to 11), 583(3 to 10), 584(4 to 6), 585(7 to 9), 587(12 to 4), 588(12 to 5), 614(8 to 1), 617(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(568: 3), (583: 2), (584: 4), (585: 2), (587: 4), (588: 2), (614: 2), (617: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 44 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
