The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
197(1 to 11), 212(3 to 10), 213(4 to 6), 214(7 to 9), 216(12 to 4), 217(12 to 5), 243(8 to 1), 245(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(197: 3), (212: 2), (213: 4), (214: 2), (216: 3), (217: 1), (243: 1), (245: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
