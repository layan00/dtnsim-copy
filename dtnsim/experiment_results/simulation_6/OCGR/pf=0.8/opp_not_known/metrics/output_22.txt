The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
971(1 to 11), 989(3 to 10), 990(4 to 6), 991(7 to 9), 993(12 to 4), 994(12 to 5), 1022(8 to 1), 1025(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(971: 3), (989: 3), (990: 4), (991: 2), (993: 2), (994: 2), (1022: 1), (1025: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
