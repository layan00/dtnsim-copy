The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1334(1 to 11), 1351(3 to 10), 1352(4 to 6), 1353(7 to 9), 1355(12 to 4), 1356(12 to 5), 1384(8 to 1), 1390(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1334: 3), (1351: 3), (1352: 4), (1353: 2), (1355: 3), (1356: 1), (1384: 2), (1390: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 45 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
