The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1715(1 to 11), 1732(3 to 10), 1733(4 to 6), 1734(7 to 9), 1738(12 to 4), 1739(12 to 5), 1764(8 to 1), 1765(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1733: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1715: 3), (1732: 2), (1733: 4), (1734: 3), (1738: 3), (1739: 2), (1764: 1), (1765: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
