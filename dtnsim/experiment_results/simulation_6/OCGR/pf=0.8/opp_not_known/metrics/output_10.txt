The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 11), 217(3 to 10), 218(4 to 6), 219(7 to 9), 220(12 to 4), 221(12 to 5), 246(8 to 1), 248(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 55.000000), (248: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 5), (217: 2), (218: 4), (219: 2), (220: 3), (221: 2), (246: 1), (248: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 201: (to: 5, time: 0.000000),
