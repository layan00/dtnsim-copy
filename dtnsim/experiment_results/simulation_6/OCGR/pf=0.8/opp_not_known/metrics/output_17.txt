The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
956(1 to 11), 974(3 to 10), 975(4 to 6), 976(7 to 9), 978(12 to 4), 979(12 to 5), 1004(8 to 1), 1009(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(956: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(956: 3), (974: 4), (975: 2), (976: 2), (978: 3), (979: 1), (1004: 1), (1009: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 956: (to: 13, time: 0.000000),
