The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 11), 225(3 to 10), 226(4 to 6), 227(7 to 9), 228(12 to 4), 229(12 to 5), 259(8 to 1), 261(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 5), (225: 2), (226: 4), (227: 2), (228: 4), (229: 1), (259: 1), (261: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
