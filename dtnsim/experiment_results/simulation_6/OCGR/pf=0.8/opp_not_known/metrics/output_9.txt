The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1735(1 to 11), 1752(3 to 10), 1753(4 to 6), 1754(7 to 9), 1756(12 to 4), 1757(12 to 5), 1782(8 to 1), 1785(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1735: 3), (1752: 2), (1753: 4), (1754: 2), (1756: 3), (1757: 2), (1782: 1), (1785: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
