The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
582(1 to 11), 598(3 to 10), 599(4 to 6), 600(7 to 9), 603(12 to 4), 604(12 to 5), 634(8 to 1), 636(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(599: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(582: 3), (598: 2), (599: 4), (600: 2), (603: 4), (604: 2), (634: 1), (636: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
