The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1727(1 to 11), 1745(3 to 10), 1746(4 to 6), 1747(7 to 9), 1748(12 to 4), 1749(12 to 5), 1775(8 to 1), 1786(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1746: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1727: 3), (1745: 4), (1746: 3), (1747: 2), (1748: 3), (1749: 1), (1775: 1), (1786: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
