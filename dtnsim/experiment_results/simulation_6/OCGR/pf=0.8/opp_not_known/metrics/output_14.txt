The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1734(1 to 11), 1750(3 to 10), 1751(4 to 6), 1752(7 to 9), 1754(12 to 4), 1755(12 to 5), 1780(8 to 1), 1784(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1734: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1734: 3), (1750: 3), (1751: 4), (1752: 3), (1754: 3), (1755: 1), (1780: 1), (1784: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
