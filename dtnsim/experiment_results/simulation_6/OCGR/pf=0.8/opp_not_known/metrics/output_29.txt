The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1736(1 to 11), 1753(3 to 10), 1754(4 to 6), 1755(7 to 9), 1758(12 to 4), 1759(12 to 5), 1789(8 to 1), 1793(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1736: 3), (1753: 2), (1754: 2), (1755: 2), (1758: 4), (1759: 1), (1789: 1), (1793: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
