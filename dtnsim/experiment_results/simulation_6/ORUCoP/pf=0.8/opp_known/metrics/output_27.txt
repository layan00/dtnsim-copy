The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
637(1 to 11), 641(3 to 10), 642(4 to 6), 643(7 to 9), 650(12 to 4), 651(12 to 5), 673(8 to 1), 678(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(637: 60.000000), (641: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(637: 6), (641: 4), (642: 4), (643: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
