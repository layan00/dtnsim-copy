The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(1 to 11), 656(3 to 10), 657(4 to 6), 658(7 to 9), 664(12 to 4), 665(12 to 5), 687(8 to 1), 696(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 4), (657: 4), (687: 3), (696: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
