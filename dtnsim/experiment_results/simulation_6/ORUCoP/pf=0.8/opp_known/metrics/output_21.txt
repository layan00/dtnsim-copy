The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
418(1 to 11), 421(3 to 10), 422(4 to 6), 423(7 to 9), 427(12 to 4), 428(12 to 5), 450(8 to 1), 454(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(418: 4), (422: 4), (454: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 418: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 422: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 55.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 454: (to: 14, time: 55.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 454: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10:

Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Bundle 418: (to: 10, time: 40.000000), (to: 10, time: 40.000000),
