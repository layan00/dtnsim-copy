The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1136(1 to 11), 1139(3 to 10), 1140(4 to 6), 1141(7 to 9), 1146(12 to 4), 1147(12 to 5), 1168(8 to 1), 1174(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1136: 60.000000), (1140: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1136: 6), (1139: 2), (1140: 4), (1141: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
