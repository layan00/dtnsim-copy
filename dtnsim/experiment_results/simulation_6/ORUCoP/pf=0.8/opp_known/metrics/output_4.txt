The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1144(1 to 11), 1149(3 to 10), 1150(4 to 6), 1151(7 to 9), 1155(12 to 4), 1156(12 to 5), 1178(8 to 1), 1190(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1144: 5), (1149: 4), (1150: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
