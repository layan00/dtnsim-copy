The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1140(1 to 11), 1142(3 to 10), 1143(4 to 6), 1144(7 to 9), 1148(12 to 4), 1149(12 to 5), 1171(8 to 1), 1181(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1140: 5), (1142: 4), (1143: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1140: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 1142: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 1142: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4:
