The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
428(1 to 11), 433(3 to 10), 434(4 to 6), 435(7 to 9), 441(12 to 4), 442(12 to 5), 468(8 to 1), 471(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(433: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(428: 4), (433: 4), (434: 4), (441: 1), (442: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
