The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1116(1 to 11), 1120(3 to 10), 1121(4 to 6), 1122(7 to 9), 1127(12 to 4), 1128(12 to 5), 1149(8 to 1), 1151(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1121: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1116: 4), (1121: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1116: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 1121: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 1121: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8:
