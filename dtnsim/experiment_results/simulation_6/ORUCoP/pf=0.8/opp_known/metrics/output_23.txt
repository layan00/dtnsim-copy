The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
903(1 to 11), 907(3 to 10), 908(4 to 6), 909(7 to 9), 913(12 to 4), 914(12 to 5), 935(8 to 1), 938(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(908: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(903: 4), (908: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 903: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 908: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 908: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Bundle 903: (to: 10, time: 40.000000), (to: 10, time: 40.000000), 
Node 14: 
Bundle 908: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 15:
