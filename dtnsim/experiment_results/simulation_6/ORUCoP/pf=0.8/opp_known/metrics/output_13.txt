The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
894(1 to 11), 897(3 to 10), 898(4 to 6), 899(7 to 9), 905(12 to 4), 906(12 to 5), 928(8 to 1), 939(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(894: 4), (897: 2), (898: 4), (928: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
