The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
156(1 to 11), 161(3 to 10), 162(4 to 6), 163(7 to 9), 167(12 to 4), 168(12 to 5), 187(8 to 1), 190(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(162: 55.000000), (190: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(156: 5), (162: 5), (190: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 156: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 162: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 156: (to: 14, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 162: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 190: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 190: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Bundle 156: (to: 10, time: 40.000000), 
Node 14:
