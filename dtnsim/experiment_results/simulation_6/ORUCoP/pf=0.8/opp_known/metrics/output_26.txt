The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
379(1 to 11), 381(3 to 10), 382(4 to 6), 383(7 to 9), 389(12 to 4), 390(12 to 5), 410(8 to 1), 418(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(382: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(379: 4), (382: 6), (389: 2), (390: 2), (410: 4), (418: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
