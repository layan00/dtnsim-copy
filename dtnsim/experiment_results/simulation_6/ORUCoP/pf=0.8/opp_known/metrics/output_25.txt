The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
149(1 to 11), 151(3 to 10), 152(4 to 6), 153(7 to 9), 158(12 to 4), 159(12 to 5), 181(8 to 1), 185(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(149: 5), (152: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 149: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 152: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 149: (to: 9, time: 50.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Bundle 149: (to: 10, time: 40.000000), (to: 10, time: 40.000000), 
Node 14: 
Bundle 152: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
