The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
658(1 to 11), 663(3 to 10), 664(4 to 6), 665(7 to 9), 673(12 to 4), 674(12 to 5), 699(8 to 1), 703(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(658: 4), (664: 3), (665: 2), (673: 2), (674: 1), (703: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
