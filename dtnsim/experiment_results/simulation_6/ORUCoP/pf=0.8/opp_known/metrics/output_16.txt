The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
399(1 to 11), 402(3 to 10), 403(4 to 6), 404(7 to 9), 409(12 to 4), 410(12 to 5), 434(8 to 1), 436(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(399: 4), (403: 4), (409: 2), (410: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 399: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 403: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 409: (to: 11, time: 35.000000), (to: 11, time: 35.000000), 
Bundle 410: (to: 11, time: 35.000000), (to: 8, time: 100.000000), 
Node 13: 
Bundle 399: (to: 10, time: 40.000000), (to: 10, time: 40.000000), 
Node 14:
