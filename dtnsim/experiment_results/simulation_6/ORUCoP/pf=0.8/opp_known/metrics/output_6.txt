The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
411(1 to 11), 415(3 to 10), 416(4 to 6), 417(7 to 9), 422(12 to 4), 423(12 to 5), 448(8 to 1), 455(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(416: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(411: 5), (415: 2), (416: 4), (422: 1), (423: 1), (455: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
