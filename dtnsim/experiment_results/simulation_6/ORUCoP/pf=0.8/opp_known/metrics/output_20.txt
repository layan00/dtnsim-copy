The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
166(1 to 11), 172(3 to 10), 173(4 to 6), 174(7 to 9), 182(12 to 4), 183(12 to 5), 209(8 to 1), 215(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(172: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(166: 4), (172: 6), (173: 7), (174: 2), (182: 1), (183: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
