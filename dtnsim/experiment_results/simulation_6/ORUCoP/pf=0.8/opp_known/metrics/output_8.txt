The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
896(1 to 11), 899(3 to 10), 900(4 to 6), 901(7 to 9), 906(12 to 4), 907(12 to 5), 932(8 to 1), 938(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(899: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(896: 4), (899: 7), (900: 4), (906: 1), (907: 1), (938: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
