The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
666(1 to 11), 669(3 to 10), 670(4 to 6), 671(7 to 9), 677(12 to 4), 678(12 to 5), 699(8 to 1), 703(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(670: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(666: 4), (669: 1), (670: 6), (703: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 666: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2:
