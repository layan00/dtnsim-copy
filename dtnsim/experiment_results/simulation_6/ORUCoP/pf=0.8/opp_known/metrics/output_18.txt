The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
875(1 to 11), 879(3 to 10), 880(4 to 6), 881(7 to 9), 885(12 to 4), 886(12 to 5), 911(8 to 1), 923(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(875: 4), (879: 2), (880: 4), (885: 1), (886: 1), (911: 3), (923: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
