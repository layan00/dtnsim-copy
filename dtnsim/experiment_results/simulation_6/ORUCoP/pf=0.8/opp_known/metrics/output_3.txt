The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
900(1 to 11), 903(3 to 10), 904(4 to 6), 905(7 to 9), 911(12 to 4), 912(12 to 5), 934(8 to 1), 941(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(900: 4), (903: 1), (904: 4), (934: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 900: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 903: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), 
Node 4:
