The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
399(1 to 11), 402(3 to 10), 403(4 to 6), 404(7 to 9), 410(12 to 4), 411(12 to 5), 440(8 to 1), 443(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(403: 55.000000), (411: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(399: 4), (403: 5), (410: 4), (411: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
