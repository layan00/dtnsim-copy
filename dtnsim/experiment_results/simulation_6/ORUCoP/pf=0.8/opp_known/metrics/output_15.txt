The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
165(1 to 11), 171(3 to 10), 172(4 to 6), 173(7 to 9), 178(12 to 4), 179(12 to 5), 208(8 to 1), 211(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(165: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(165: 7), (172: 3), (178: 2), (179: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 165: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2:
