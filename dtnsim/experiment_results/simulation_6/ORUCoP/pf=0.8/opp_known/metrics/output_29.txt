The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1155(1 to 11), 1159(3 to 10), 1160(4 to 6), 1161(7 to 9), 1166(12 to 4), 1167(12 to 5), 1195(8 to 1), 1200(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1155: 5), (1160: 7), (1166: 3), (1167: 3), (1200: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
