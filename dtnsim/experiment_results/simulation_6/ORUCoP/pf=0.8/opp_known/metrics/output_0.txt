The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
165(1 to 11), 169(3 to 10), 170(4 to 6), 171(7 to 9), 181(12 to 4), 182(12 to 5), 203(8 to 1), 219(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(171: 25.000000), (219: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(165: 14), (169: 3), (170: 4), (171: 3), (219: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 247 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
