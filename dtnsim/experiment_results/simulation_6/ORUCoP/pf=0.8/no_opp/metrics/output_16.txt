The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
79(1 to 11), 82(3 to 10), 83(4 to 6), 84(7 to 9), 89(12 to 4), 90(12 to 5), 96(8 to 1), 98(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(89: 2), (90: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
