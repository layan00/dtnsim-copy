The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
148(1 to 11), 153(3 to 10), 154(4 to 6), 155(7 to 9), 163(12 to 4), 164(12 to 5), 171(8 to 1), 175(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(154: 1), (155: 2), (163: 2), (164: 1), (175: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4:
