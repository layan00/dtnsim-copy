The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
251(1 to 11), 255(3 to 10), 256(4 to 6), 257(7 to 9), 263(12 to 4), 264(12 to 5), 267(8 to 1), 271(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(257: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
