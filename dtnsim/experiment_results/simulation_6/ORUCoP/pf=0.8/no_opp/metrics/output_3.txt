The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
191(1 to 11), 194(3 to 10), 195(4 to 6), 196(7 to 9), 202(12 to 4), 203(12 to 5), 207(8 to 1), 210(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 1), (207: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 194: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 207: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13:
