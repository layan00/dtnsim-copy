The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
33(1 to 11), 37(3 to 10), 38(4 to 6), 39(7 to 9), 49(12 to 4), 50(12 to 5), 53(8 to 1), 64(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(39: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(37: 3), (38: 2), (39: 3), (64: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 88 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 37: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 37: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), (to: 2, time: 25.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 38: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 39: (to: 11, time: 25.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 64: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), (to: 10, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 39: (to: 9, time: 50.000000),
