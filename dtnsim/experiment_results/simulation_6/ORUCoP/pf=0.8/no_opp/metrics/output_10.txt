The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
24(1 to 11), 27(3 to 10), 28(4 to 6), 29(7 to 9), 33(12 to 4), 34(12 to 5), 37(8 to 1), 40(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(40: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(24: 1), (40: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 24: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 40: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 40: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Node 14: 
Node 15:
