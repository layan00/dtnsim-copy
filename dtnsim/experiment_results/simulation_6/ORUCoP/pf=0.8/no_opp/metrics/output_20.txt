The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
34(1 to 11), 40(3 to 10), 41(4 to 6), 42(7 to 9), 50(12 to 4), 51(12 to 5), 56(8 to 1), 69(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(41: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(40: 4), (41: 6), (42: 2), (50: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 40: (to: 1, time: 25.000000), (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 41: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 40: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 41: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4:
