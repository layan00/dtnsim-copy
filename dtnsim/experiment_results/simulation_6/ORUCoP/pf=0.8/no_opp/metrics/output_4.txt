The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(1 to 11), 250(3 to 10), 251(4 to 6), 252(7 to 9), 256(12 to 4), 257(12 to 5), 262(8 to 1), 279(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(251: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 2), (250: 4), (251: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 245: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 245: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 250: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 251: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 250: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 251: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 251: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 5:
