The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
143(1 to 11), 145(3 to 10), 146(4 to 6), 147(7 to 9), 153(12 to 4), 154(12 to 5), 158(8 to 1), 166(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(146: 2), (158: 2), (166: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 146: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 158: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 158: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 166: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000),
