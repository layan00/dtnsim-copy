The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
59(1 to 11), 61(3 to 10), 62(4 to 6), 63(7 to 9), 69(12 to 4), 70(12 to 5), 74(8 to 1), 78(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(59: 2), (69: 2), (74: 1), (78: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 59: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 59: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 78: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 74: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 78: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 69: (to: 8, time: 100.000000), (to: 8, time: 100.000000),
