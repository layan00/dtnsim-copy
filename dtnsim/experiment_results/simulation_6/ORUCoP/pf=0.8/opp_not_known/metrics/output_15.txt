The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
177(1 to 11), 196(3 to 10), 197(4 to 6), 198(7 to 9), 203(12 to 4), 204(12 to 5), 240(8 to 1), 243(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(177: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(177: 5), (197: 3), (203: 2), (204: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 250 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 177: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
