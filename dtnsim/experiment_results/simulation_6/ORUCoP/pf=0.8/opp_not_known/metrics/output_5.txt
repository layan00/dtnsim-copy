The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(1 to 11), 190(3 to 10), 191(4 to 6), 192(7 to 9), 200(12 to 4), 201(12 to 5), 234(8 to 1), 236(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 4), (190: 2), (191: 4), (200: 1), (201: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 172: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 190: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), (to: 2, time: 25.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 191: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 172: (to: 9, time: 30.000000),
