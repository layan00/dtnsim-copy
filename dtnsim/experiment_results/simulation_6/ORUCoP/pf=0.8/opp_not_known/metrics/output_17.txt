The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
881(1 to 11), 900(3 to 10), 901(4 to 6), 902(7 to 9), 908(12 to 4), 909(12 to 5), 940(8 to 1), 945(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(881: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(881: 6), (900: 4), (901: 7), (909: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 203 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
