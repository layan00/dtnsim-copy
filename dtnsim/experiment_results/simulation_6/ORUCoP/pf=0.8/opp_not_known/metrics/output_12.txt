The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
899(1 to 11), 917(3 to 10), 918(4 to 6), 919(7 to 9), 925(12 to 4), 926(12 to 5), 957(8 to 1), 961(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(917: 35.000000), (918: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(899: 4), (917: 4), (918: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 194 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 899: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 0.000000),
