The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1247(1 to 11), 1265(3 to 10), 1266(4 to 6), 1267(7 to 9), 1272(12 to 4), 1273(12 to 5), 1308(8 to 1), 1317(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1247: 6), (1265: 1), (1266: 4), (1267: 1), (1272: 1), (1273: 2), (1308: 3), (1317: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 220 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
