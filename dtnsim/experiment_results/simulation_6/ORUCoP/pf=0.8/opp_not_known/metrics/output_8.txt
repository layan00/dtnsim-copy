The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1264(1 to 11), 1281(3 to 10), 1282(4 to 6), 1283(7 to 9), 1288(12 to 4), 1289(12 to 5), 1324(8 to 1), 1329(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1264: 6), (1281: 1), (1282: 4), (1288: 1), (1289: 2), (1329: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 203 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
