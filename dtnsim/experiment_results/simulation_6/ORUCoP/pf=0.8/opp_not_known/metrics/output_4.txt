The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1633(1 to 11), 1652(3 to 10), 1653(4 to 6), 1654(7 to 9), 1658(12 to 4), 1659(12 to 5), 1691(8 to 1), 1700(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1633: 6), (1652: 3), (1653: 7), (1659: 1), (1700: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 64 calls to RUCoP, which took 240 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
