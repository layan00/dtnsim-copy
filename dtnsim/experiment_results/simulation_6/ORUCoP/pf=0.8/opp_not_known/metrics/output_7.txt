The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
902(1 to 11), 918(3 to 10), 919(4 to 6), 920(7 to 9), 926(12 to 4), 927(12 to 5), 959(8 to 1), 967(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(902: 6), (919: 4), (926: 2), (927: 1), (959: 2), (967: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 209 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
