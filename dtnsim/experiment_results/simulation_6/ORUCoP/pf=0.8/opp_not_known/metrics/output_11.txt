The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
530(1 to 11), 547(3 to 10), 548(4 to 6), 549(7 to 9), 555(12 to 4), 556(12 to 5), 593(8 to 1), 596(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(548: 55.000000), (555: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(530: 6), (548: 4), (555: 4), (556: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 155 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
