The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
528(1 to 11), 545(3 to 10), 546(4 to 6), 547(7 to 9), 552(12 to 4), 553(12 to 5), 586(8 to 1), 588(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(528: 6), (546: 4), (552: 2), (553: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 179 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
