The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1634(1 to 11), 1650(3 to 10), 1651(4 to 6), 1652(7 to 9), 1656(12 to 4), 1657(12 to 5), 1689(8 to 1), 1696(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1634: 6), (1650: 3), (1651: 4), (1657: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 223 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
