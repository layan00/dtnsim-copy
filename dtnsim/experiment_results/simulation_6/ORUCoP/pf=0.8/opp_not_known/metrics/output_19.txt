The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1607(1 to 11), 1625(3 to 10), 1626(4 to 6), 1627(7 to 9), 1634(12 to 4), 1635(12 to 5), 1666(8 to 1), 1668(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1626: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1607: 6), (1626: 4), (1627: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 200 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
