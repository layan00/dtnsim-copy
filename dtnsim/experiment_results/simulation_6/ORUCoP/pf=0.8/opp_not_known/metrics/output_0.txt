The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
177(1 to 11), 195(3 to 10), 196(4 to 6), 197(7 to 9), 207(12 to 4), 208(12 to 5), 239(8 to 1), 248(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(197: 25.000000), (248: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(177: 6), (195: 4), (196: 4), (197: 3), (208: 1), (248: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 62 calls to RUCoP, which took 246 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
