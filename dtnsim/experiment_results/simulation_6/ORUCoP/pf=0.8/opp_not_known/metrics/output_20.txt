The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
178(1 to 11), 198(3 to 10), 199(4 to 6), 200(7 to 9), 210(12 to 4), 211(12 to 5), 247(8 to 1), 252(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(198: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(178: 4), (198: 6), (199: 7), (200: 2), (210: 1), (211: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 242 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
