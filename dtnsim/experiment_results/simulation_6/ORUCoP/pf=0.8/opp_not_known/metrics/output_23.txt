The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1277(1 to 11), 1295(3 to 10), 1296(4 to 6), 1297(7 to 9), 1301(12 to 4), 1302(12 to 5), 1333(8 to 1), 1336(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1296: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1277: 4), (1296: 4), (1301: 2), (1302: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
