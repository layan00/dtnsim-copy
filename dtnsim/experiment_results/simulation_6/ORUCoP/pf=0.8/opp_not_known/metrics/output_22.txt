The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
912(1 to 11), 931(3 to 10), 932(4 to 6), 933(7 to 9), 940(12 to 4), 941(12 to 5), 976(8 to 1), 980(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(912: 4), (932: 3), (933: 1), (940: 1), (941: 2), (980: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 211 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
