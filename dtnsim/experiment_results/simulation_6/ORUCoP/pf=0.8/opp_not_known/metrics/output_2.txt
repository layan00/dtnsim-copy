The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
911(1 to 11), 928(3 to 10), 929(4 to 6), 930(7 to 9), 937(12 to 4), 938(12 to 5), 969(8 to 1), 973(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(929: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(911: 6), (928: 2), (929: 6), (938: 1), (973: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 219 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
