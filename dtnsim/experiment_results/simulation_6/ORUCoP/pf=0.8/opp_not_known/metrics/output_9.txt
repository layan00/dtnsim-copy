The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1626(1 to 11), 1644(3 to 10), 1645(4 to 6), 1646(7 to 9), 1652(12 to 4), 1653(12 to 5), 1684(8 to 1), 1688(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1645: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1626: 4), (1645: 4), (1646: 1), (1688: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 192 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1626: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 0.000000),
