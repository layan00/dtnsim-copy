The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
550(1 to 11), 567(3 to 10), 568(4 to 6), 569(7 to 9), 573(12 to 4), 574(12 to 5), 606(8 to 1), 610(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(550: 6), (568: 4), (573: 2), (574: 3), (610: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 208 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
