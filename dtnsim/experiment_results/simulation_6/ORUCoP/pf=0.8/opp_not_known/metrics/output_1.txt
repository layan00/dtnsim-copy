The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
551(1 to 11), 570(3 to 10), 571(4 to 6), 572(7 to 9), 580(12 to 4), 581(12 to 5), 617(8 to 1), 620(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(570: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(551: 6), (570: 6), (571: 4), (580: 1), (581: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 210 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
