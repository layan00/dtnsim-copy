The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1267(1 to 11), 1284(3 to 10), 1285(4 to 6), 1286(7 to 9), 1293(12 to 4), 1294(12 to 5), 1326(8 to 1), 1331(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1267: 6), (1284: 2), (1285: 4), (1294: 3), (1326: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 209 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
