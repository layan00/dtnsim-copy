The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
885(1 to 11), 903(3 to 10), 904(4 to 6), 905(7 to 9), 913(12 to 4), 914(12 to 5), 946(8 to 1), 952(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(885: 60.000000), (903: 35.000000), (952: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(885: 6), (903: 4), (904: 4), (905: 1), (914: 1), (952: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 197 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
