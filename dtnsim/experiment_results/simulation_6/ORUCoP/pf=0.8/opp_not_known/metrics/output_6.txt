The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
540(1 to 11), 558(3 to 10), 559(4 to 6), 560(7 to 9), 565(12 to 4), 566(12 to 5), 601(8 to 1), 606(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(559: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(540: 6), (558: 1), (559: 4), (565: 2), (566: 2), (606: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 181 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
