The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
168(1 to 11), 184(3 to 10), 185(4 to 6), 186(7 to 9), 190(12 to 4), 191(12 to 5), 221(8 to 1), 224(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(185: 55.000000), (224: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(168: 4), (185: 4), (224: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 214 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 168: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 185: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 168: (to: 15, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 185: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 224: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 224: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 10:
