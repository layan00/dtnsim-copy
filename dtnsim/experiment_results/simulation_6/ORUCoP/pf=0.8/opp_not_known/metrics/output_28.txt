The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1266(1 to 11), 1284(3 to 10), 1285(4 to 6), 1286(7 to 9), 1295(12 to 4), 1296(12 to 5), 1329(8 to 1), 1332(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1266: 5), (1285: 4), (1286: 3), (1295: 2), (1296: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 74 calls to RUCoP, which took 298 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
