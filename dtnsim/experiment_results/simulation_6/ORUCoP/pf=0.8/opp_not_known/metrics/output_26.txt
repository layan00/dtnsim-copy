The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
510(1 to 11), 526(3 to 10), 527(4 to 6), 528(7 to 9), 533(12 to 4), 534(12 to 5), 566(8 to 1), 572(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(510: 4), (527: 6), (533: 2), (534: 2), (566: 1), (572: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 203 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
