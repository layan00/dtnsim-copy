The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1628(1 to 11), 1645(3 to 10), 1646(4 to 6), 1647(7 to 9), 1652(12 to 4), 1653(12 to 5), 1684(8 to 1), 1689(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1628: 60.000000), (1646: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1628: 6), (1645: 1), (1646: 4), (1647: 4), (1653: 1), (1689: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 209 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
