The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1637(1 to 11), 1655(3 to 10), 1656(4 to 6), 1657(7 to 9), 1663(12 to 4), 1664(12 to 5), 1701(8 to 1), 1705(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1637: 4), (1656: 7), (1657: 1), (1663: 3), (1664: 2), (1705: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 220 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
