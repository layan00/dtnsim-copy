The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1061(1 to 11), 1066(3 to 10), 1067(4 to 6), 1068(7 to 9), 1074(12 to 4), 1075(12 to 5), 1101(8 to 1), 1115(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1061: 60.000000), (1066: 55.000000), (1067: 35.000000), (1074: 85.000000), (1075: 85.000000), (1101: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1061: 6), (1066: 7), (1067: 6), (1068: 2), (1074: 3), (1075: 5), (1101: 7), (1115: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
