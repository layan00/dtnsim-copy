The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
190(1 to 11), 197(3 to 10), 198(4 to 6), 199(7 to 9), 212(12 to 4), 213(12 to 5), 238(8 to 1), 248(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(190: 60.000000), (197: 15.000000), (199: 25.000000), (248: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(190: 6), (197: 7), (198: 3), (199: 3), (248: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 234 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
