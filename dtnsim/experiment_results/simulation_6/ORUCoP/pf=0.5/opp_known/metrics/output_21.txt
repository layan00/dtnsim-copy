The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
503(1 to 11), 510(3 to 10), 511(4 to 6), 512(7 to 9), 521(12 to 4), 522(12 to 5), 552(8 to 1), 558(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(510: 15.000000), (511: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(503: 4), (510: 5), (511: 4), (512: 2), (521: 7), (522: 5), (558: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
