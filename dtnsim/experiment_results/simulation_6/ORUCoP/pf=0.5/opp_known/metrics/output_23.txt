The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1078(1 to 11), 1085(3 to 10), 1086(4 to 6), 1087(7 to 9), 1093(12 to 4), 1094(12 to 5), 1116(8 to 1), 1123(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1085: 55.000000), (1086: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1078: 6), (1085: 7), (1086: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
