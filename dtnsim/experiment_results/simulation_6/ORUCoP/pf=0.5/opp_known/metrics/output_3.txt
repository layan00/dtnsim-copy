The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1034(1 to 11), 1040(3 to 10), 1041(4 to 6), 1042(7 to 9), 1048(12 to 4), 1049(12 to 5), 1076(8 to 1), 1085(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1034: 40.000000), (1040: 55.000000), (1041: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1034: 7), (1040: 4), (1041: 6), (1048: 1), (1049: 1), (1076: 3), (1085: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
