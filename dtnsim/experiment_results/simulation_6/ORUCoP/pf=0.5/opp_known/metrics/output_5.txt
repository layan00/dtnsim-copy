The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
178(1 to 11), 186(3 to 10), 187(4 to 6), 188(7 to 9), 195(12 to 4), 196(12 to 5), 218(8 to 1), 222(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(186: 55.000000), (222: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(178: 5), (186: 4), (187: 4), (195: 1), (196: 1), (222: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
