The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1327(1 to 11), 1333(3 to 10), 1334(4 to 6), 1335(7 to 9), 1340(12 to 4), 1341(12 to 5), 1367(8 to 1), 1381(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1327: 60.000000), (1333: 35.000000), (1334: 55.000000), (1340: 85.000000), (1341: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1327: 6), (1333: 6), (1334: 4), (1340: 3), (1341: 5), (1367: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
