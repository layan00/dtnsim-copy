The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
757(1 to 11), 761(3 to 10), 762(4 to 6), 763(7 to 9), 770(12 to 4), 771(12 to 5), 798(8 to 1), 806(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(757: 60.000000), (762: 35.000000), (806: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(757: 6), (761: 2), (762: 6), (770: 2), (771: 2), (806: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
