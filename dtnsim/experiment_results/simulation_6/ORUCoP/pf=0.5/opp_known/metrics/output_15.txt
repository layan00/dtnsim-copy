The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
181(1 to 11), 189(3 to 10), 190(4 to 6), 191(7 to 9), 199(12 to 4), 200(12 to 5), 231(8 to 1), 234(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(181: 40.000000), (189: 15.000000), (190: 45.000000), (199: 85.000000), (200: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(181: 7), (189: 4), (190: 4), (191: 2), (199: 5), (200: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
