The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1326(1 to 11), 1333(3 to 10), 1334(4 to 6), 1335(7 to 9), 1342(12 to 4), 1343(12 to 5), 1362(8 to 1), 1368(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1334: 35.000000), (1335: 45.000000), (1368: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1326: 5), (1334: 6), (1335: 3), (1368: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
