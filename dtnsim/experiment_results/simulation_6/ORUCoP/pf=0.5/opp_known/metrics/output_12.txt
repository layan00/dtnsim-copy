The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
768(1 to 11), 773(3 to 10), 774(4 to 6), 775(7 to 9), 782(12 to 4), 783(12 to 5), 804(8 to 1), 808(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(773: 55.000000), (774: 35.000000), (808: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(768: 4), (773: 4), (774: 4), (808: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
