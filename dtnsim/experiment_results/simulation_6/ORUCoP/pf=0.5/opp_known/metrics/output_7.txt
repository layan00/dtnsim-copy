The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
767(1 to 11), 769(3 to 10), 770(4 to 6), 771(7 to 9), 778(12 to 4), 779(12 to 5), 804(8 to 1), 814(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(767: 60.000000), (814: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(767: 6), (770: 4), (778: 1), (779: 1), (804: 3), (814: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
