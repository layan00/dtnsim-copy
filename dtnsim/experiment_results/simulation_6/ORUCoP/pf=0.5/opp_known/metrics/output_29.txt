The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1360(1 to 11), 1368(3 to 10), 1369(4 to 6), 1370(7 to 9), 1376(12 to 4), 1377(12 to 5), 1405(8 to 1), 1412(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1376: 25.000000), (1377: 45.000000), (1412: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1360: 5), (1369: 4), (1376: 6), (1377: 7), (1412: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
