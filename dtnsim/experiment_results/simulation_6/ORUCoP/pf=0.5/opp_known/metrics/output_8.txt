The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1044(1 to 11), 1052(3 to 10), 1053(4 to 6), 1054(7 to 9), 1061(12 to 4), 1062(12 to 5), 1089(8 to 1), 1099(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1044: 60.000000), (1052: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1044: 6), (1052: 6), (1053: 4), (1054: 3), (1061: 2), (1062: 2), (1099: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
