The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
751(1 to 11), 756(3 to 10), 757(4 to 6), 758(7 to 9), 766(12 to 4), 767(12 to 5), 796(8 to 1), 804(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(751: 60.000000), (756: 55.000000), (766: 25.000000), (767: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(751: 6), (756: 7), (757: 4), (758: 1), (766: 6), (767: 7), (804: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
