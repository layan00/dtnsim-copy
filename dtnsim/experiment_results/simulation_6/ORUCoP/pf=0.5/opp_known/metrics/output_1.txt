The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
478(1 to 11), 483(3 to 10), 484(4 to 6), 485(7 to 9), 493(12 to 4), 494(12 to 5), 521(8 to 1), 527(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(483: 15.000000), (494: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(478: 4), (483: 4), (484: 4), (493: 2), (494: 5), (527: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
