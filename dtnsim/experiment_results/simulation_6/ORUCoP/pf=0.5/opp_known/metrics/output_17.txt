The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
758(1 to 11), 764(3 to 10), 765(4 to 6), 766(7 to 9), 772(12 to 4), 773(12 to 5), 795(8 to 1), 805(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(758: 60.000000), (764: 55.000000), (765: 35.000000), (772: 85.000000), (773: 85.000000), (795: 35.000000), (805: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(758: 6), (764: 4), (765: 6), (772: 4), (773: 5), (795: 7), (805: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
