The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1371(1 to 11), 1380(3 to 10), 1381(4 to 6), 1382(7 to 9), 1390(12 to 4), 1391(12 to 5), 1416(8 to 1), 1422(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1371: 60.000000), (1380: 15.000000), (1381: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1371: 6), (1380: 6), (1381: 4), (1382: 2), (1390: 1), (1391: 1), (1422: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
