The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
460(1 to 11), 464(3 to 10), 465(4 to 6), 466(7 to 9), 472(12 to 4), 473(12 to 5), 496(8 to 1), 513(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(465: 35.000000), (513: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(460: 4), (464: 4), (465: 6), (472: 2), (473: 2), (496: 4), (513: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
