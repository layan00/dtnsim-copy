The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
791(1 to 11), 799(3 to 10), 800(4 to 6), 801(7 to 9), 811(12 to 4), 812(12 to 5), 839(8 to 1), 846(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(799: 15.000000), (800: 35.000000), (846: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(791: 4), (799: 4), (800: 4), (801: 2), (811: 2), (812: 1), (846: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
