The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
621(1 to 11), 642(3 to 10), 643(4 to 6), 644(7 to 9), 656(12 to 4), 657(12 to 5), 693(8 to 1), 698(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(642: 15.000000), (643: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(621: 4), (642: 6), (643: 4), (644: 2), (656: 3), (657: 2), (698: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 62 calls to RUCoP, which took 253 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
