The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1022(1 to 11), 1044(3 to 10), 1045(4 to 6), 1046(7 to 9), 1058(12 to 4), 1059(12 to 5), 1094(8 to 1), 1102(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1044: 15.000000), (1102: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1022: 4), (1044: 6), (1045: 2), (1046: 2), (1058: 1), (1059: 2), (1102: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
