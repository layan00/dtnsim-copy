The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1420(1 to 11), 1441(3 to 10), 1442(4 to 6), 1443(7 to 9), 1458(12 to 4), 1459(12 to 5), 1497(8 to 1), 1508(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1441: 15.000000), (1442: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1420: 4), (1441: 6), (1442: 4), (1443: 3), (1458: 3), (1459: 3), (1497: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 236 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
