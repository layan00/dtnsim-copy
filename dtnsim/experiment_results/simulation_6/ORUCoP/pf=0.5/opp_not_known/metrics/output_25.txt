The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
186(1 to 11), 203(3 to 10), 204(4 to 6), 205(7 to 9), 211(12 to 4), 212(12 to 5), 250(8 to 1), 255(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(205: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 4), (204: 4), (205: 4), (211: 3), (212: 2), (255: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
