The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1407(1 to 11), 1426(3 to 10), 1427(4 to 6), 1428(7 to 9), 1435(12 to 4), 1436(12 to 5), 1473(8 to 1), 1484(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1407: 60.000000), (1427: 35.000000), (1435: 85.000000), (1484: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1407: 6), (1426: 1), (1427: 6), (1428: 3), (1435: 3), (1436: 2), (1473: 1), (1484: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 199 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
