The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1013(1 to 11), 1031(3 to 10), 1032(4 to 6), 1033(7 to 9), 1043(12 to 4), 1044(12 to 5), 1081(8 to 1), 1093(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1013: 60.000000), (1031: 35.000000), (1032: 25.000000), (1093: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1013: 6), (1031: 6), (1032: 5), (1033: 2), (1043: 3), (1044: 2), (1093: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 173 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
