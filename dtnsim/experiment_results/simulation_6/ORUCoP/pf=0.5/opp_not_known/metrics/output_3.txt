The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1417(1 to 11), 1436(3 to 10), 1437(4 to 6), 1438(7 to 9), 1445(12 to 4), 1446(12 to 5), 1482(8 to 1), 1489(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1437: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1417: 5), (1436: 2), (1437: 6), (1445: 2), (1446: 2), (1482: 1), (1489: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 261 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
