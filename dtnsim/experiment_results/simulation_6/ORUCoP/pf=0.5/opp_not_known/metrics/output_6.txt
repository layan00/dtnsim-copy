The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
600(1 to 11), 620(3 to 10), 621(4 to 6), 622(7 to 9), 631(12 to 4), 632(12 to 5), 667(8 to 1), 676(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(600: 4), (620: 2), (621: 3), (631: 4), (632: 3), (676: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 68 calls to RUCoP, which took 316 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
