The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
207(1 to 11), 231(3 to 10), 232(4 to 6), 233(7 to 9), 248(12 to 4), 249(12 to 5), 287(8 to 1), 297(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 15.000000), (232: 25.000000), (248: 25.000000), (297: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(207: 5), (231: 6), (232: 4), (233: 5), (248: 4), (249: 2), (297: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 272 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
