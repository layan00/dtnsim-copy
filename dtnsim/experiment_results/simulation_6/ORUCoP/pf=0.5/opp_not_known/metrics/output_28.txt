The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1417(1 to 11), 1435(3 to 10), 1436(4 to 6), 1437(7 to 9), 1448(12 to 4), 1449(12 to 5), 1485(8 to 1), 1496(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1436: 55.000000), (1437: 25.000000), (1496: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1417: 5), (1436: 6), (1437: 4), (1448: 2), (1449: 4), (1485: 1), (1496: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 227 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
