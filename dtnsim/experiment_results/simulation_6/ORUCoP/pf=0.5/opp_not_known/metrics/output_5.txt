The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
190(1 to 11), 209(3 to 10), 210(4 to 6), 211(7 to 9), 222(12 to 4), 223(12 to 5), 257(8 to 1), 262(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(211: 25.000000), (262: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(190: 4), (209: 2), (210: 4), (211: 3), (222: 1), (223: 2), (262: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 211 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
