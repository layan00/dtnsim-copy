The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
596(1 to 11), 615(3 to 10), 616(4 to 6), 617(7 to 9), 623(12 to 4), 624(12 to 5), 659(8 to 1), 664(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(596: 60.000000), (616: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(596: 6), (615: 1), (616: 4), (617: 2), (623: 3), (624: 2), (664: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
