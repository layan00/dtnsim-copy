The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1013(1 to 11), 1032(3 to 10), 1033(4 to 6), 1034(7 to 9), 1042(12 to 4), 1043(12 to 5), 1074(8 to 1), 1079(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1032: 35.000000), (1033: 35.000000), (1079: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1013: 4), (1032: 4), (1033: 4), (1042: 2), (1043: 2), (1079: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
