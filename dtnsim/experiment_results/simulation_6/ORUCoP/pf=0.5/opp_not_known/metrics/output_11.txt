The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
603(1 to 11), 621(3 to 10), 622(4 to 6), 623(7 to 9), 633(12 to 4), 634(12 to 5), 671(8 to 1), 675(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(603: 60.000000), (621: 35.000000), (622: 55.000000), (623: 45.000000), (633: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(603: 6), (621: 4), (622: 4), (623: 4), (633: 4), (634: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 183 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
