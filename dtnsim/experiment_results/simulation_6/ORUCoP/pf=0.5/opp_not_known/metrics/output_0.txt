The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 11), 223(3 to 10), 224(4 to 6), 225(7 to 9), 238(12 to 4), 239(12 to 5), 271(8 to 1), 284(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 60.000000), (223: 15.000000), (224: 25.000000), (225: 25.000000), (284: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 6), (223: 6), (224: 4), (225: 3), (284: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 231 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
