The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1831(1 to 11), 1850(3 to 10), 1851(4 to 6), 1852(7 to 9), 1860(12 to 4), 1861(12 to 5), 1898(8 to 1), 1907(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1860: 25.000000), (1907: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1831: 5), (1851: 3), (1852: 1), (1860: 5), (1861: 2), (1907: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 180 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
