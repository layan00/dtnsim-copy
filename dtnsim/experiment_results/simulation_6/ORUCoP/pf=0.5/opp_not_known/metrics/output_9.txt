The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1796(1 to 11), 1814(3 to 10), 1815(4 to 6), 1816(7 to 9), 1824(12 to 4), 1825(12 to 5), 1855(8 to 1), 1862(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1815: 35.000000), (1816: 45.000000), (1862: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1796: 5), (1815: 6), (1816: 3), (1824: 2), (1825: 2), (1862: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 225 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
