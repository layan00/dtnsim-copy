The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1430(1 to 11), 1450(3 to 10), 1451(4 to 6), 1452(7 to 9), 1458(12 to 4), 1459(12 to 5), 1490(8 to 1), 1499(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1451: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1430: 5), (1450: 2), (1451: 5), (1458: 2), (1459: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 224 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
