The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1830(1 to 11), 1849(3 to 10), 1850(4 to 6), 1851(7 to 9), 1860(12 to 4), 1861(12 to 5), 1894(8 to 1), 1902(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1849: 35.000000), (1860: 85.000000), (1902: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1830: 4), (1849: 3), (1850: 3), (1851: 1), (1860: 3), (1861: 2), (1902: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 211 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
