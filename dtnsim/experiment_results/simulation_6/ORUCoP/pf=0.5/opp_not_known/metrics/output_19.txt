The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1821(1 to 11), 1841(3 to 10), 1842(4 to 6), 1843(7 to 9), 1852(12 to 4), 1853(12 to 5), 1886(8 to 1), 1897(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1843: 25.000000), (1853: 15.000000), (1897: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1821: 4), (1842: 2), (1843: 3), (1852: 1), (1853: 4), (1897: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 216 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
