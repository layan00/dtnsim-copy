The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(1 to 11), 214(3 to 10), 215(4 to 6), 216(7 to 9), 226(12 to 4), 227(12 to 5), 257(8 to 1), 266(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(196: 60.000000), (214: 35.000000), (215: 55.000000), (216: 25.000000), (266: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 5), (214: 3), (215: 4), (216: 3), (226: 2), (227: 2), (266: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 192 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
