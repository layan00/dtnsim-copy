The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
999(1 to 11), 1015(3 to 10), 1016(4 to 6), 1017(7 to 9), 1024(12 to 4), 1025(12 to 5), 1061(8 to 1), 1070(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(999: 60.000000), (1070: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(999: 6), (1016: 4), (1024: 2), (1025: 2), (1061: 2), (1070: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 168 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
