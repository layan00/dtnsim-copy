The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
586(1 to 11), 604(3 to 10), 605(4 to 6), 606(7 to 9), 612(12 to 4), 613(12 to 5), 646(8 to 1), 663(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(605: 35.000000), (646: 15.000000), (663: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(586: 4), (604: 4), (605: 6), (612: 2), (613: 3), (646: 4), (663: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 223 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
