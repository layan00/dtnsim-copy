The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
193(1 to 11), 214(3 to 10), 215(4 to 6), 216(7 to 9), 226(12 to 4), 227(12 to 5), 264(8 to 1), 267(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(193: 60.000000), (214: 15.000000), (215: 45.000000), (226: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(193: 7), (214: 6), (215: 4), (216: 4), (226: 5), (227: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 228 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
