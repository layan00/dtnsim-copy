The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
999(1 to 11), 1018(3 to 10), 1019(4 to 6), 1020(7 to 9), 1029(12 to 4), 1030(12 to 5), 1067(8 to 1), 1075(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(999: 60.000000), (1018: 35.000000), (1029: 25.000000), (1075: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(999: 6), (1018: 4), (1019: 4), (1020: 1), (1029: 5), (1030: 2), (1075: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 181 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
