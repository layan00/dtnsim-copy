The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
610(1 to 11), 629(3 to 10), 630(4 to 6), 631(7 to 9), 642(12 to 4), 643(12 to 5), 678(8 to 1), 684(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(629: 55.000000), (642: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(610: 4), (629: 9), (630: 4), (642: 3), (643: 2), (684: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 229 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
