The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1398(1 to 11), 1417(3 to 10), 1418(4 to 6), 1419(7 to 9), 1427(12 to 4), 1428(12 to 5), 1466(8 to 1), 1474(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1398: 60.000000), (1417: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1398: 5), (1417: 3), (1418: 4), (1419: 3), (1427: 2), (1428: 2), (1474: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 201 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
