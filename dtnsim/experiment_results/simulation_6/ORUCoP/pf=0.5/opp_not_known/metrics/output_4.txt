The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1825(1 to 11), 1845(3 to 10), 1846(4 to 6), 1847(7 to 9), 1852(12 to 4), 1853(12 to 5), 1888(8 to 1), 1905(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1825: 60.000000), (1845: 35.000000), (1846: 25.000000), (1852: 85.000000), (1888: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1825: 6), (1845: 6), (1846: 4), (1852: 3), (1853: 2), (1888: 4), (1905: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 155 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
