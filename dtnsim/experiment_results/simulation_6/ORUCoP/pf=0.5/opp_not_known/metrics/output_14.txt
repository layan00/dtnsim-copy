The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1835(1 to 11), 1855(3 to 10), 1856(4 to 6), 1857(7 to 9), 1868(12 to 4), 1869(12 to 5), 1906(8 to 1), 1912(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1835: 60.000000), (1855: 15.000000), (1856: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1835: 7), (1855: 6), (1856: 4), (1857: 2), (1868: 1), (1869: 2), (1912: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 241 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
