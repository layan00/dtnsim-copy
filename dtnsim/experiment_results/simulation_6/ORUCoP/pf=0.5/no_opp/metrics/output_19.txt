The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
430(1 to 11), 436(3 to 10), 437(4 to 6), 438(7 to 9), 445(12 to 4), 446(12 to 5), 454(8 to 1), 464(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(446: 15.000000), (464: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(437: 2), (445: 2), (446: 4), (464: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
