The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
336(1 to 11), 342(3 to 10), 343(4 to 6), 344(7 to 9), 352(12 to 4), 353(12 to 5), 363(8 to 1), 372(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(336: 60.000000), (342: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(336: 6), (342: 3), (344: 3), (352: 2), (372: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 336: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
