The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
448(1 to 11), 454(3 to 10), 455(4 to 6), 456(7 to 9), 463(12 to 4), 464(12 to 5), 476(8 to 1), 486(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(463: 25.000000), (486: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(448: 4), (455: 2), (463: 8), (464: 1), (486: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
