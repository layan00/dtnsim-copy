The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
49(1 to 11), 56(3 to 10), 57(4 to 6), 58(7 to 9), 67(12 to 4), 68(12 to 5), 77(8 to 1), 81(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(49: 60.000000), (57: 45.000000), (67: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(49: 6), (56: 2), (57: 2), (58: 2), (67: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 49: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
