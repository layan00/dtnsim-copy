The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
341(1 to 11), 346(3 to 10), 347(4 to 6), 348(7 to 9), 355(12 to 4), 356(12 to 5), 364(8 to 1), 370(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(341: 4), (346: 1), (355: 1), (364: 1), (370: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 341: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 346: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5:
