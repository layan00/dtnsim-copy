The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
46(1 to 11), 52(3 to 10), 53(4 to 6), 54(7 to 9), 62(12 to 4), 63(12 to 5), 68(8 to 1), 72(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(72: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(46: 2), (52: 1), (62: 1), (72: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 46: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 52: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 46: (to: 9, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 72: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 72: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 62: (to: 11, time: 40.000000), 
Node 13:
