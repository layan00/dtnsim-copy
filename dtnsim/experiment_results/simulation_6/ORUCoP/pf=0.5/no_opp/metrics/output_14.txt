The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
470(1 to 11), 477(3 to 10), 478(4 to 6), 479(7 to 9), 488(12 to 4), 489(12 to 5), 496(8 to 1), 503(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(470: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(470: 5), (477: 3), (479: 2), (488: 1), (503: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 470: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2:
