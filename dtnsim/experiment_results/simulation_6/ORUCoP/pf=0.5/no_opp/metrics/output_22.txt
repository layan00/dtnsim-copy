The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
264(1 to 11), 272(3 to 10), 273(4 to 6), 274(7 to 9), 284(12 to 4), 285(12 to 5), 292(8 to 1), 300(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(300: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(272: 2), (273: 2), (274: 2), (284: 2), (285: 1), (300: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
