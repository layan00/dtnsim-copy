The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
154(1 to 11), 158(3 to 10), 159(4 to 6), 160(7 to 9), 171(12 to 4), 172(12 to 5), 183(8 to 1), 187(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(158: 35.000000), (160: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(154: 2), (158: 3), (160: 4), (171: 4), (172: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
