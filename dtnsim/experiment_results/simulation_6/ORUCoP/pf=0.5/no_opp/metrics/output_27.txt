The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
238(1 to 11), 243(3 to 10), 244(4 to 6), 245(7 to 9), 253(12 to 4), 254(12 to 5), 264(8 to 1), 274(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 35.000000), (253: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 6), (245: 1), (253: 8), (254: 1), (274: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
