The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
330(1 to 11), 335(3 to 10), 336(4 to 6), 337(7 to 9), 345(12 to 4), 346(12 to 5), 354(8 to 1), 364(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(330: 60.000000), (345: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(330: 5), (335: 1), (337: 2), (345: 3), (354: 1), (364: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
