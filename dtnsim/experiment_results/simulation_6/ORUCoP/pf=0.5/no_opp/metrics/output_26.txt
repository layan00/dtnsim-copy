The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
133(1 to 11), 137(3 to 10), 138(4 to 6), 139(7 to 9), 146(12 to 4), 147(12 to 5), 152(8 to 1), 173(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(138: 25.000000), (152: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(133: 2), (137: 4), (138: 6), (146: 2), (152: 4), (173: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
