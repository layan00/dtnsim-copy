The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
243(1 to 11), 247(3 to 10), 248(4 to 6), 249(7 to 9), 257(12 to 4), 258(12 to 5), 265(8 to 1), 280(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 60.000000), (247: 35.000000), (248: 25.000000), (280: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 4), (247: 6), (248: 5), (257: 2), (280: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
