The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
427(1 to 11), 432(3 to 10), 433(4 to 6), 434(7 to 9), 444(12 to 4), 445(12 to 5), 448(8 to 1), 456(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(434: 45.000000), (456: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(427: 6), (434: 3), (456: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 427: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000),
