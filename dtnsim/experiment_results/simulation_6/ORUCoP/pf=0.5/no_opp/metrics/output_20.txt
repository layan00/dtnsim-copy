The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
63(1 to 11), 73(3 to 10), 74(4 to 6), 75(7 to 9), 90(12 to 4), 91(12 to 5), 101(8 to 1), 114(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(73: 35.000000), (74: 25.000000), (90: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(63: 5), (73: 5), (74: 4), (75: 6), (90: 4), (114: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
