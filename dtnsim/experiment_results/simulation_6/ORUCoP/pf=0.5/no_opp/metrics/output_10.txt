The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
52(1 to 11), 57(3 to 10), 58(4 to 6), 59(7 to 9), 67(12 to 4), 68(12 to 5), 74(8 to 1), 83(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(52: 60.000000), (57: 35.000000), (83: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(52: 6), (57: 3), (58: 1), (83: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 52: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2:
