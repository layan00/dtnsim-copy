The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
144(1 to 11), 150(3 to 10), 151(4 to 6), 152(7 to 9), 164(12 to 4), 165(12 to 5), 177(8 to 1), 186(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(144: 4), (150: 2), (151: 1), (164: 6), (165: 3), (186: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
