The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
143(1 to 11), 148(3 to 10), 149(4 to 6), 150(7 to 9), 156(12 to 4), 157(12 to 5), 167(8 to 1), 172(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(149: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(148: 1), (149: 2), (150: 2), (156: 4), (157: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3:
