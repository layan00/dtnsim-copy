The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
438(1 to 11), 444(3 to 10), 445(4 to 6), 446(7 to 9), 451(12 to 4), 452(12 to 5), 460(8 to 1), 478(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(438: 60.000000), (444: 35.000000), (445: 25.000000), (451: 85.000000), (460: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(438: 4), (444: 6), (445: 4), (451: 3), (460: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
