The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
460(1 to 11), 466(3 to 10), 467(4 to 6), 468(7 to 9), 480(12 to 4), 481(12 to 5), 487(8 to 1), 495(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(466: 35.000000), (480: 85.000000), (495: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(460: 4), (466: 3), (467: 1), (468: 2), (480: 3), (495: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 460: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000),
