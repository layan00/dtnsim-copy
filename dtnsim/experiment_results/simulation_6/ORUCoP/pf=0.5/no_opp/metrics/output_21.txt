The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(1 to 11), 179(3 to 10), 180(4 to 6), 181(7 to 9), 190(12 to 4), 191(12 to 5), 200(8 to 1), 206(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(180: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(179: 3), (180: 2), (181: 2), (190: 4), (191: 1), (206: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
