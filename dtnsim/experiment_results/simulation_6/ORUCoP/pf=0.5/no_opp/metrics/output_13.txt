The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
352(1 to 11), 359(3 to 10), 360(4 to 6), 361(7 to 9), 373(12 to 4), 374(12 to 5), 388(8 to 1), 406(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(359: 35.000000), (360: 25.000000), (361: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(352: 3), (359: 5), (360: 4), (361: 8), (373: 4), (374: 2), (388: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
