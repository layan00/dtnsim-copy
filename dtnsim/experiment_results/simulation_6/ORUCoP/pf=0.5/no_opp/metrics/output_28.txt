The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
345(1 to 11), 350(3 to 10), 351(4 to 6), 352(7 to 9), 363(12 to 4), 364(12 to 5), 374(8 to 1), 383(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(345: 6), (352: 2), (363: 2), (364: 3), (374: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 345: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000),

Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 345: (to: 9, time: 30.000000), (to: 9, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 352: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000),
