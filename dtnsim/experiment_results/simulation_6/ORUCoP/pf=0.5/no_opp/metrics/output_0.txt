The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
58(1 to 11), 65(3 to 10), 66(4 to 6), 67(7 to 9), 80(12 to 4), 81(12 to 5), 86(8 to 1), 100(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(66: 25.000000), (67: 25.000000), (100: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(58: 2), (65: 4), (66: 4), (67: 3), (100: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 88 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 58: (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
