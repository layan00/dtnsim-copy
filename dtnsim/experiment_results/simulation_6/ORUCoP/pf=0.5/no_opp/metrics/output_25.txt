The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
42(1 to 11), 45(3 to 10), 46(4 to 6), 47(7 to 9), 54(12 to 4), 55(12 to 5), 64(8 to 1), 70(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(47: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(42: 3), (47: 4), (54: 2), (70: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 42: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 42: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 47: (to: 9, time: 70.000000), (to: 9, time: 70.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 47: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 70: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Bundle 54: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), 
Node 12: 
Bundle 54: (to: 11, time: 40.000000),
