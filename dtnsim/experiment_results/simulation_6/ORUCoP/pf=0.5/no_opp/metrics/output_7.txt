The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
243(1 to 11), 245(3 to 10), 246(4 to 6), 247(7 to 9), 256(12 to 4), 257(12 to 5), 263(8 to 1), 273(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 60.000000), (273: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 4), (246: 2), (256: 1), (263: 2), (273: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
