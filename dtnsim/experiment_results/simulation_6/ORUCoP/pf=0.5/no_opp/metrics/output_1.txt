The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
158(1 to 11), 163(3 to 10), 164(4 to 6), 165(7 to 9), 175(12 to 4), 176(12 to 5), 183(8 to 1), 189(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(158: 1), (163: 3), (175: 2), (176: 1), (189: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 158: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), 
Bundle 163: (to: 5, time: 30.000000),
