The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
230(1 to 11), 236(3 to 10), 237(4 to 6), 238(7 to 9), 244(12 to 4), 245(12 to 5), 249(8 to 1), 259(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 35.000000), (244: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 3), (237: 2), (244: 4), (249: 2), (259: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
