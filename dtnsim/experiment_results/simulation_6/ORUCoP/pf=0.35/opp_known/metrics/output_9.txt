The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1520(1 to 11), 1530(3 to 10), 1531(4 to 6), 1532(7 to 9), 1542(12 to 4), 1543(12 to 5), 1567(8 to 1), 1575(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1530: 15.000000), (1531: 35.000000), (1532: 45.000000), (1575: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1520: 5), (1530: 6), (1531: 6), (1532: 4), (1542: 1), (1543: 1), (1575: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
