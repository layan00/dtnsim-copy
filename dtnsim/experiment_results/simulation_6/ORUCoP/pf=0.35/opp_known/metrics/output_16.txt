The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
487(1 to 11), 492(3 to 10), 493(4 to 6), 494(7 to 9), 501(12 to 4), 502(12 to 5), 532(8 to 1), 543(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(487: 60.000000), (492: 55.000000), (493: 35.000000), (532: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(487: 6), (492: 7), (493: 4), (494: 2), (501: 8), (502: 7), (532: 7), (543: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
