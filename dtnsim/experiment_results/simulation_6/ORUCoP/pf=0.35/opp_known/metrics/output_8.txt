The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1194(1 to 11), 1203(3 to 10), 1204(4 to 6), 1205(7 to 9), 1217(12 to 4), 1218(12 to 5), 1250(8 to 1), 1261(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1194: 40.000000), (1203: 35.000000), (1204: 55.000000), (1217: 85.000000), (1218: 85.000000), (1261: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1194: 7), (1203: 6), (1204: 5), (1205: 6), (1217: 9), (1218: 10), (1261: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
