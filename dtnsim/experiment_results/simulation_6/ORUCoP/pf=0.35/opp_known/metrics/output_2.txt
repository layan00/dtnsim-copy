The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
881(1 to 11), 886(3 to 10), 887(4 to 6), 888(7 to 9), 896(12 to 4), 897(12 to 5), 926(8 to 1), 940(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(881: 60.000000), (887: 35.000000), (926: 35.000000), (940: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(881: 6), (886: 2), (887: 6), (888: 2), (896: 5), (897: 5), (926: 7), (940: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
