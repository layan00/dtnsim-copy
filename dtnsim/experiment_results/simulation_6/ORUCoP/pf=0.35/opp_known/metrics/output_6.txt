The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
529(1 to 11), 538(3 to 10), 539(4 to 6), 540(7 to 9), 549(12 to 4), 550(12 to 5), 590(8 to 1), 604(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(529: 40.000000), (538: 35.000000), (539: 35.000000), (549: 85.000000), (550: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(529: 7), (538: 6), (539: 4), (540: 1), (549: 20), (550: 9), (604: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
