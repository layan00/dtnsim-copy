The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1447(1 to 11), 1455(3 to 10), 1456(4 to 6), 1457(7 to 9), 1467(12 to 4), 1468(12 to 5), 1504(8 to 1), 1511(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1455: 15.000000), (1456: 55.000000), (1511: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1447: 4), (1455: 4), (1456: 4), (1467: 8), (1468: 4), (1511: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
