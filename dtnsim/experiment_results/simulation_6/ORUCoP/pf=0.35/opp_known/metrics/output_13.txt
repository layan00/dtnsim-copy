The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1129(1 to 11), 1139(3 to 10), 1140(4 to 6), 1141(7 to 9), 1159(12 to 4), 1160(12 to 5), 1210(8 to 1), 1228(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1139: 15.000000), (1140: 55.000000), (1141: 45.000000), (1160: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1129: 6), (1139: 5), (1140: 9), (1141: 24), (1159: 16), (1160: 7), (1210: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
