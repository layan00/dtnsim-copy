The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
554(1 to 11), 560(3 to 10), 561(4 to 6), 562(7 to 9), 573(12 to 4), 574(12 to 5), 607(8 to 1), 613(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(554: 60.000000), (560: 15.000000), (561: 35.000000), (562: 45.000000), (573: 85.000000), (574: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(554: 6), (560: 4), (561: 6), (562: 7), (573: 9), (574: 10), (613: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
