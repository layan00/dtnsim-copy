The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 11), 212(3 to 10), 213(4 to 6), 214(7 to 9), 230(12 to 4), 231(12 to 5), 268(8 to 1), 282(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 40.000000), (212: 15.000000), (214: 45.000000), (230: 25.000000), (231: 45.000000), (282: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 7), (212: 6), (213: 4), (214: 24), (230: 4), (231: 6), (282: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
