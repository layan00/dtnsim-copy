The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 11), 214(3 to 10), 215(4 to 6), 216(7 to 9), 232(12 to 4), 233(12 to 5), 281(8 to 1), 298(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 60.000000), (214: 15.000000), (215: 55.000000), (216: 25.000000), (298: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 6), (214: 7), (215: 9), (216: 7), (232: 13), (233: 5), (281: 6), (298: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 236 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
