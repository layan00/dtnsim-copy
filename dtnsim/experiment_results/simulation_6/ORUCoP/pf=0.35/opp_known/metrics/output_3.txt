The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1200(1 to 11), 1207(3 to 10), 1208(4 to 6), 1209(7 to 9), 1218(12 to 4), 1219(12 to 5), 1247(8 to 1), 1256(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1200: 40.000000), (1207: 55.000000), (1208: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1200: 7), (1207: 4), (1208: 4), (1209: 1), (1218: 2), (1219: 1), (1247: 3), (1256: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
