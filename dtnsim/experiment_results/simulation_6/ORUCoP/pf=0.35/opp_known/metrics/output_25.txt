The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
192(1 to 11), 198(3 to 10), 199(4 to 6), 200(7 to 9), 209(12 to 4), 210(12 to 5), 252(8 to 1), 263(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(192: 60.000000), (198: 15.000000), (199: 55.000000), (200: 45.000000), (209: 85.000000), (210: 85.000000), (263: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(192: 6), (198: 4), (199: 6), (200: 4), (209: 16), (210: 6), (252: 3), (263: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
