The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
844(1 to 11), 853(3 to 10), 854(4 to 6), 855(7 to 9), 870(12 to 4), 871(12 to 5), 898(8 to 1), 907(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(853: 15.000000), (854: 35.000000), (907: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(844: 4), (853: 6), (854: 5), (855: 4), (870: 2), (871: 1), (907: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
