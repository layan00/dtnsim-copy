The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
190(1 to 11), 200(3 to 10), 201(4 to 6), 202(7 to 9), 210(12 to 4), 211(12 to 5), 233(8 to 1), 244(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(190: 20.000000), (201: 35.000000), (233: 35.000000), (244: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(190: 7), (200: 2), (201: 4), (210: 3), (211: 3), (233: 7), (244: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
