The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1479(1 to 11), 1488(3 to 10), 1489(4 to 6), 1490(7 to 9), 1498(12 to 4), 1499(12 to 5), 1524(8 to 1), 1532(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1479: 60.000000), (1488: 15.000000), (1489: 35.000000), (1532: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1479: 6), (1488: 6), (1489: 6), (1490: 2), (1498: 2), (1499: 2), (1532: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
