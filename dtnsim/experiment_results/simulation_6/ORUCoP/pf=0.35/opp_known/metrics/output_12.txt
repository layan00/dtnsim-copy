The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
814(1 to 11), 821(3 to 10), 822(4 to 6), 823(7 to 9), 832(12 to 4), 833(12 to 5), 859(8 to 1), 865(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(821: 15.000000), (822: 35.000000), (823: 45.000000), (865: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(814: 4), (821: 4), (822: 4), (823: 3), (832: 1), (833: 1), (865: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
