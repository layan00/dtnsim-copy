The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
863(1 to 11), 866(3 to 10), 867(4 to 6), 868(7 to 9), 876(12 to 4), 877(12 to 5), 912(8 to 1), 926(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(863: 60.000000), (866: 55.000000), (877: 85.000000), (926: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(863: 6), (866: 7), (867: 4), (868: 2), (876: 8), (877: 8), (912: 3), (926: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
