The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
536(1 to 11), 545(3 to 10), 546(4 to 6), 547(7 to 9), 558(12 to 4), 559(12 to 5), 595(8 to 1), 602(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(545: 15.000000), (546: 35.000000), (547: 45.000000), (602: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(536: 6), (545: 5), (546: 4), (547: 4), (558: 8), (559: 4), (602: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
