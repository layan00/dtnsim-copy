The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
520(1 to 11), 525(3 to 10), 526(4 to 6), 527(7 to 9), 533(12 to 4), 534(12 to 5), 562(8 to 1), 580(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(526: 35.000000), (580: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(520: 4), (525: 4), (526: 6), (533: 3), (534: 3), (562: 4), (580: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
