The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1063(1 to 11), 1083(3 to 10), 1084(4 to 6), 1085(7 to 9), 1096(12 to 4), 1097(12 to 5), 1133(8 to 1), 1139(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1083: 15.000000), (1084: 45.000000), (1085: 45.000000), (1139: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1063: 4), (1083: 6), (1084: 4), (1085: 3), (1096: 2), (1097: 2), (1139: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 225 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
