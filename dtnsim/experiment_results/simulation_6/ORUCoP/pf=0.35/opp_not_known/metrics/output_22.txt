The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1068(1 to 11), 1090(3 to 10), 1091(4 to 6), 1092(7 to 9), 1109(12 to 4), 1110(12 to 5), 1144(8 to 1), 1156(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1090: 25.000000), (1091: 25.000000), (1156: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1068: 4), (1090: 8), (1091: 4), (1092: 3), (1109: 1), (1110: 2), (1156: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 239 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
