The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1549(1 to 11), 1569(3 to 10), 1570(4 to 6), 1571(7 to 9), 1581(12 to 4), 1582(12 to 5), 1616(8 to 1), 1624(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1570: 55.000000), (1624: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1549: 5), (1569: 2), (1570: 4), (1571: 1), (1581: 2), (1582: 2), (1616: 2), (1624: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 252 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
