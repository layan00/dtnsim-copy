The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
632(1 to 11), 650(3 to 10), 651(4 to 6), 652(7 to 9), 664(12 to 4), 665(12 to 5), 704(8 to 1), 713(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(632: 60.000000), (650: 35.000000), (651: 55.000000), (652: 45.000000), (664: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(632: 6), (650: 4), (651: 6), (652: 4), (664: 5), (665: 3), (704: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 226 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
