The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
199(1 to 11), 220(3 to 10), 221(4 to 6), 222(7 to 9), 235(12 to 4), 236(12 to 5), 271(8 to 1), 276(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(199: 60.000000), (220: 25.000000), (221: 45.000000), (235: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(199: 7), (220: 8), (221: 4), (222: 3), (235: 5), (236: 2), (276: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 244 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
