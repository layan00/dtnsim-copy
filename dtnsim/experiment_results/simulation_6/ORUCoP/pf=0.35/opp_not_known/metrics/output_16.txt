The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
618(1 to 11), 636(3 to 10), 637(4 to 6), 638(7 to 9), 645(12 to 4), 646(12 to 5), 683(8 to 1), 692(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(618: 60.000000), (637: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(618: 6), (636: 1), (637: 4), (638: 2), (645: 3), (646: 2), (683: 2), (692: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 228 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
