The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(1 to 11), 676(3 to 10), 677(4 to 6), 678(7 to 9), 689(12 to 4), 690(12 to 5), 725(8 to 1), 738(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(654: 60.000000), (676: 35.000000), (677: 55.000000), (678: 25.000000), (689: 85.000000), (690: 15.000000), (738: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 7), (676: 3), (677: 4), (678: 3), (689: 5), (690: 5), (738: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 263 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
