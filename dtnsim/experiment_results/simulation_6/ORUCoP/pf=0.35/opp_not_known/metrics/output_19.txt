The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1889(1 to 11), 1910(3 to 10), 1911(4 to 6), 1912(7 to 9), 1926(12 to 4), 1927(12 to 5), 1963(8 to 1), 1974(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1910: 15.000000), (1912: 25.000000), (1927: 15.000000), (1974: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1889: 4), (1910: 6), (1911: 2), (1912: 3), (1926: 2), (1927: 4), (1974: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 233 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
