The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1500(1 to 11), 1522(3 to 10), 1523(4 to 6), 1524(7 to 9), 1535(12 to 4), 1536(12 to 5), 1569(8 to 1), 1579(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1579: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1500: 5), (1522: 2), (1523: 3), (1524: 2), (1535: 2), (1536: 3), (1579: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 299 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
