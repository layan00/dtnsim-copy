The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1078(1 to 11), 1098(3 to 10), 1099(4 to 6), 1100(7 to 9), 1112(12 to 4), 1113(12 to 5), 1155(8 to 1), 1172(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1078: 60.000000), (1098: 15.000000), (1099: 35.000000), (1112: 25.000000), (1155: 15.000000), (1172: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1078: 7), (1098: 6), (1099: 6), (1100: 4), (1112: 5), (1113: 2), (1155: 8), (1172: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 199 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
