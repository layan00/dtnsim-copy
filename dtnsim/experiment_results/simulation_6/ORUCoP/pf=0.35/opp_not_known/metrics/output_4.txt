The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1976(1 to 11), 1995(3 to 10), 1996(4 to 6), 1997(7 to 9), 2004(12 to 4), 2005(12 to 5), 2040(8 to 1), 2062(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1976: 60.000000), (1995: 35.000000), (1996: 25.000000), (1997: 45.000000), (2004: 85.000000), (2040: 15.000000), (2062: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1976: 7), (1995: 6), (1996: 4), (1997: 4), (2004: 3), (2005: 2), (2040: 8), (2062: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 194 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
