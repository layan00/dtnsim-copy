The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1940(1 to 11), 1960(3 to 10), 1961(4 to 6), 1962(7 to 9), 1973(12 to 4), 1974(12 to 5), 2011(8 to 1), 2021(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1940: 60.000000), (1960: 15.000000), (1961: 35.000000), (2021: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1940: 7), (1960: 6), (1961: 5), (1962: 2), (1973: 2), (1974: 2), (2021: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 209 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
