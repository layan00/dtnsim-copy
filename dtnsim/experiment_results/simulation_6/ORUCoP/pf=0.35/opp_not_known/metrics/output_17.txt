The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1034(1 to 11), 1054(3 to 10), 1055(4 to 6), 1056(7 to 9), 1068(12 to 4), 1069(12 to 5), 1103(8 to 1), 1114(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1034: 60.000000), (1054: 35.000000), (1068: 85.000000), (1114: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1034: 6), (1054: 4), (1055: 2), (1056: 2), (1068: 3), (1069: 2), (1103: 4), (1114: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 254 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
