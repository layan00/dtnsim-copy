The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 11), 227(3 to 10), 228(4 to 6), 229(7 to 9), 242(12 to 4), 243(12 to 5), 281(8 to 1), 295(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(228: 35.000000), (229: 25.000000), (242: 25.000000), (295: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 5), (227: 2), (228: 6), (229: 6), (242: 5), (243: 2), (281: 4), (295: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 176 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
