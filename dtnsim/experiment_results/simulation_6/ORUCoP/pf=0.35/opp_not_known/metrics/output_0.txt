The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 11), 239(3 to 10), 240(4 to 6), 241(7 to 9), 256(12 to 4), 257(12 to 5), 294(8 to 1), 316(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 60.000000), (239: 15.000000), (240: 25.000000), (241: 25.000000), (257: 15.000000), (294: 15.000000), (316: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 7), (239: 6), (240: 4), (241: 4), (256: 1), (257: 4), (294: 8), (316: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 259 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
