The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1961(1 to 11), 1982(3 to 10), 1983(4 to 6), 1984(7 to 9), 1999(12 to 4), 2000(12 to 5), 2034(8 to 1), 2043(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1982: 25.000000), (1983: 35.000000), (1984: 45.000000), (2043: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1961: 5), (1982: 8), (1983: 6), (1984: 4), (1999: 2), (2000: 2), (2043: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 215 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
