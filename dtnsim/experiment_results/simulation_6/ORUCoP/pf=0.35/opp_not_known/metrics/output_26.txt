The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
638(1 to 11), 656(3 to 10), 657(4 to 6), 658(7 to 9), 666(12 to 4), 667(12 to 5), 706(8 to 1), 728(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(657: 35.000000), (658: 25.000000), (706: 15.000000), (728: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(638: 4), (656: 4), (657: 6), (658: 3), (666: 3), (667: 2), (706: 8), (728: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 227 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
