The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1962(1 to 11), 1981(3 to 10), 1982(4 to 6), 1983(7 to 9), 1991(12 to 4), 1992(12 to 5), 2030(8 to 1), 2045(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1991: 25.000000), (2045: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1962: 7), (1982: 4), (1983: 2), (1991: 5), (1992: 2), (2030: 4), (2045: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 198 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
