The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1090(1 to 11), 1106(3 to 10), 1107(4 to 6), 1108(7 to 9), 1116(12 to 4), 1117(12 to 5), 1154(8 to 1), 1171(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1090: 60.000000), (1116: 85.000000), (1154: 15.000000), (1171: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1090: 6), (1106: 2), (1107: 4), (1108: 2), (1116: 3), (1117: 4), (1154: 8), (1171: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 217 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
