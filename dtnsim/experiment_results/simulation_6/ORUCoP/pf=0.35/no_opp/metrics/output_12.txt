The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
302(1 to 11), 309(3 to 10), 310(4 to 6), 311(7 to 9), 320(12 to 4), 321(12 to 5), 326(8 to 1), 332(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(310: 45.000000), (311: 45.000000), (332: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(309: 2), (310: 2), (311: 3), (320: 1), (332: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
