The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
457(1 to 11), 465(3 to 10), 466(4 to 6), 467(7 to 9), 479(12 to 4), 480(12 to 5), 493(8 to 1), 508(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(457: 60.000000), (465: 35.000000), (466: 25.000000), (508: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(457: 6), (465: 6), (466: 4), (467: 6), (479: 4), (480: 1), (508: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
