The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
310(1 to 11), 317(3 to 10), 318(4 to 6), 319(7 to 9), 329(12 to 4), 330(12 to 5), 344(8 to 1), 363(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(310: 60.000000), (317: 35.000000), (318: 25.000000), (329: 25.000000), (344: 15.000000), (363: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(310: 4), (317: 5), (318: 5), (319: 4), (329: 7), (330: 1), (344: 4), (363: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
