The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
55(1 to 11), 62(3 to 10), 63(4 to 6), 64(7 to 9), 78(12 to 4), 79(12 to 5), 87(8 to 1), 93(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(55: 60.000000), (62: 25.000000), (63: 45.000000), (78: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(55: 8), (62: 5), (63: 2), (64: 2), (78: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
