The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
60(1 to 11), 66(3 to 10), 67(4 to 6), 68(7 to 9), 79(12 to 4), 80(12 to 5), 94(8 to 1), 103(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(68: 45.000000), (80: 15.000000), (103: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(60: 3), (66: 3), (68: 4), (79: 4), (80: 4), (94: 1), (103: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
