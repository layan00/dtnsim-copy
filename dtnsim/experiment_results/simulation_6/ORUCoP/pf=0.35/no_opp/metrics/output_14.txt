The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
564(1 to 11), 571(3 to 10), 572(4 to 6), 573(7 to 9), 582(12 to 4), 583(12 to 5), 590(8 to 1), 603(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(564: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(564: 5), (571: 3), (572: 4), (573: 2), (582: 2), (603: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
