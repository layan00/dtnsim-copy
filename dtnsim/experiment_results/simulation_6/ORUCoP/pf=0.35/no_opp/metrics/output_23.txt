The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
445(1 to 11), 453(3 to 10), 454(4 to 6), 455(7 to 9), 467(12 to 4), 468(12 to 5), 477(8 to 1), 488(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(445: 6), (453: 2), (454: 3), (455: 1), (467: 2), (468: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
