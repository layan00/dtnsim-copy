The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
511(1 to 11), 519(3 to 10), 520(4 to 6), 521(7 to 9), 531(12 to 4), 532(12 to 5), 540(8 to 1), 550(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(532: 15.000000), (550: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(519: 2), (520: 2), (531: 2), (532: 4), (550: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
