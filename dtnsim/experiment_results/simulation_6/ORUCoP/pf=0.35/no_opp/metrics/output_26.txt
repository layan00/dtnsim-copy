The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
182(1 to 11), 187(3 to 10), 188(4 to 6), 189(7 to 9), 196(12 to 4), 197(12 to 5), 205(8 to 1), 227(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(188: 25.000000), (205: 15.000000), (227: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(182: 2), (187: 4), (188: 6), (196: 3), (205: 4), (227: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
