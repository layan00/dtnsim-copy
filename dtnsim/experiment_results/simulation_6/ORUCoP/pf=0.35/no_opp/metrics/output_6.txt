The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
197(1 to 11), 205(3 to 10), 206(4 to 6), 207(7 to 9), 219(12 to 4), 220(12 to 5), 232(8 to 1), 246(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(197: 60.000000), (205: 35.000000), (220: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(197: 8), (205: 3), (206: 1), (207: 1), (219: 6), (220: 4), (246: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
