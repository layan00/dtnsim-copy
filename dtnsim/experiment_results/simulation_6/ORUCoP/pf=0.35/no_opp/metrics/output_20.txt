The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
69(1 to 11), 79(3 to 10), 80(4 to 6), 81(7 to 9), 96(12 to 4), 97(12 to 5), 107(8 to 1), 120(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(79: 35.000000), (80: 25.000000), (81: 45.000000), (96: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(69: 5), (79: 5), (80: 4), (81: 8), (96: 4), (120: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
