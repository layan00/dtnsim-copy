The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
349(1 to 11), 354(3 to 10), 355(4 to 6), 356(7 to 9), 366(12 to 4), 367(12 to 5), 377(8 to 1), 399(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(349: 60.000000), (354: 35.000000), (355: 25.000000), (399: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(349: 8), (354: 6), (355: 6), (356: 2), (366: 2), (377: 3), (399: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
