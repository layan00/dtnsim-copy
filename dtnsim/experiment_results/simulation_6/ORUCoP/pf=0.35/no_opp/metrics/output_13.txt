The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
428(1 to 11), 437(3 to 10), 438(4 to 6), 439(7 to 9), 460(12 to 4), 461(12 to 5), 474(8 to 1), 490(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(437: 35.000000), (438: 25.000000), (439: 25.000000), (460: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(428: 4), (437: 7), (438: 4), (439: 7), (460: 8), (461: 3), (474: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
