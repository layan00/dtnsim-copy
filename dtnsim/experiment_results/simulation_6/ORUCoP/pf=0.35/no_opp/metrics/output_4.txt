The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
602(1 to 11), 608(3 to 10), 609(4 to 6), 610(7 to 9), 618(12 to 4), 619(12 to 5), 629(8 to 1), 648(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(602: 60.000000), (608: 35.000000), (609: 25.000000), (610: 45.000000), (629: 15.000000), (648: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(602: 5), (608: 6), (609: 4), (610: 4), (618: 2), (619: 1), (629: 4), (648: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
