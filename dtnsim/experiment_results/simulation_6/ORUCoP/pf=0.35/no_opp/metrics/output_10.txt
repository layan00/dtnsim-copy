The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
58(1 to 11), 64(3 to 10), 65(4 to 6), 66(7 to 9), 75(12 to 4), 76(12 to 5), 83(8 to 1), 100(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(58: 60.000000), (64: 35.000000), (65: 25.000000), (100: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(58: 6), (64: 6), (65: 4), (83: 3), (100: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
