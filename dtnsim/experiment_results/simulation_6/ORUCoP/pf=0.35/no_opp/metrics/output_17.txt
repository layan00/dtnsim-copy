The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
277(1 to 11), 284(3 to 10), 285(4 to 6), 286(7 to 9), 296(12 to 4), 297(12 to 5), 305(8 to 1), 314(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(277: 60.000000), (284: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(277: 4), (284: 3), (285: 2), (286: 1), (296: 2), (297: 2), (305: 2), (314: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
