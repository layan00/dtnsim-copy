The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
482(1 to 11), 488(3 to 10), 489(4 to 6), 490(7 to 9), 502(12 to 4), 503(12 to 5), 512(8 to 1), 521(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(521: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(482: 6), (488: 1), (489: 1), (490: 1), (502: 2), (503: 1), (512: 1), (521: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
