The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
586(1 to 11), 594(3 to 10), 595(4 to 6), 596(7 to 9), 611(12 to 4), 612(12 to 5), 617(8 to 1), 628(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(594: 25.000000), (596: 45.000000), (628: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(586: 6), (594: 6), (596: 4), (611: 1), (628: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
