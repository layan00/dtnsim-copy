The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 11), 226(3 to 10), 227(4 to 6), 228(7 to 9), 243(12 to 4), 244(12 to 5), 257(8 to 1), 266(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 60.000000), (226: 25.000000), (228: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 8), (226: 5), (228: 7), (243: 4), (244: 1), (266: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
