The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
167(1 to 11), 172(3 to 10), 173(4 to 6), 174(7 to 9), 182(12 to 4), 183(12 to 5), 194(8 to 1), 202(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(167: 60.000000), (173: 45.000000), (202: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(167: 4), (172: 1), (173: 2), (174: 2), (182: 4), (183: 1), (194: 1), (202: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
