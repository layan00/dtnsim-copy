The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(1 to 11), 204(3 to 10), 205(4 to 6), 206(7 to 9), 222(12 to 4), 223(12 to 5), 233(8 to 1), 242(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(205: 45.000000), (206: 45.000000), (223: 15.000000), (242: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 4), (204: 5), (205: 2), (206: 3), (222: 4), (223: 4), (242: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
