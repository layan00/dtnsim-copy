The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
570(1 to 11), 576(3 to 10), 577(4 to 6), 578(7 to 9), 591(12 to 4), 592(12 to 5), 605(8 to 1), 619(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(576: 35.000000), (577: 45.000000), (619: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(570: 6), (576: 3), (577: 2), (578: 4), (591: 6), (592: 1), (605: 1), (619: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
