The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
452(1 to 11), 457(3 to 10), 458(4 to 6), 459(7 to 9), 470(12 to 4), 471(12 to 5), 484(8 to 1), 493(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(470: 25.000000), (493: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(452: 6), (459: 2), (470: 7), (471: 3), (484: 1), (493: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
