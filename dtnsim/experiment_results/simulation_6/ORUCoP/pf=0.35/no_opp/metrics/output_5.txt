The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
62(1 to 11), 70(3 to 10), 71(4 to 6), 72(7 to 9), 83(12 to 4), 84(12 to 5), 92(8 to 1), 104(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(72: 25.000000), (83: 25.000000), (104: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(62: 3), (70: 1), (71: 2), (72: 4), (83: 5), (92: 2), (104: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
