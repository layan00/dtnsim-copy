The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
394(1 to 11), 400(3 to 10), 401(4 to 6), 402(7 to 9), 411(12 to 4), 412(12 to 5), 422(8 to 1), 432(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(394: 60.000000), (402: 45.000000), (411: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(394: 5), (400: 2), (402: 3), (411: 5), (422: 1), (432: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
