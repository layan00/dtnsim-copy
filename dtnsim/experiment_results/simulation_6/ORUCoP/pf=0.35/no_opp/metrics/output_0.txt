The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
74(1 to 11), 82(3 to 10), 83(4 to 6), 84(7 to 9), 99(12 to 4), 100(12 to 5), 112(8 to 1), 135(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(74: 60.000000), (83: 25.000000), (84: 25.000000), (100: 15.000000), (112: 15.000000), (135: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(74: 4), (82: 4), (83: 4), (84: 4), (99: 1), (100: 7), (112: 8), (135: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 87 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
