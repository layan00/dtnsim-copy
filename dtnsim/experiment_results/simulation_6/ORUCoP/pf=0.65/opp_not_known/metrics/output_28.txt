The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1342(1 to 11), 1360(3 to 10), 1361(4 to 6), 1362(7 to 9), 1371(12 to 4), 1372(12 to 5), 1407(8 to 1), 1413(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1342: 5), (1361: 4), (1362: 3), (1371: 2), (1372: 2), (1407: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 78 calls to RUCoP, which took 300 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
