The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1695(1 to 11), 1714(3 to 10), 1715(4 to 6), 1716(7 to 9), 1724(12 to 4), 1725(12 to 5), 1756(8 to 1), 1761(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1715: 55.000000), (1716: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1695: 4), (1715: 4), (1716: 3), (1724: 2), (1725: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 202 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
