The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1387(1 to 11), 1406(3 to 10), 1407(4 to 6), 1408(7 to 9), 1413(12 to 4), 1414(12 to 5), 1445(8 to 1), 1454(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1407: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1387: 4), (1406: 2), (1407: 5), (1413: 3), (1414: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
