The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
935(1 to 11), 954(3 to 10), 955(4 to 6), 956(7 to 9), 963(12 to 4), 964(12 to 5), 996(8 to 1), 1005(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(935: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(935: 6), (954: 4), (955: 4), (963: 3), (964: 2), (996: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 181 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
