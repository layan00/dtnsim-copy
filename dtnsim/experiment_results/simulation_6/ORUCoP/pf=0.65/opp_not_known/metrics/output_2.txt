The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
949(1 to 11), 966(3 to 10), 967(4 to 6), 968(7 to 9), 976(12 to 4), 977(12 to 5), 1009(8 to 1), 1014(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(967: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(949: 4), (966: 2), (967: 4), (976: 3), (977: 2), (1014: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 222 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
