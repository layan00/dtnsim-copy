The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1768(1 to 11), 1786(3 to 10), 1787(4 to 6), 1788(7 to 9), 1798(12 to 4), 1799(12 to 5), 1834(8 to 1), 1840(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1768: 60.000000), (1786: 15.000000), (1787: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1768: 7), (1786: 6), (1787: 4), (1788: 2), (1798: 1), (1799: 2), (1840: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 234 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
