The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
980(1 to 11), 999(3 to 10), 1000(4 to 6), 1001(7 to 9), 1009(12 to 4), 1010(12 to 5), 1041(8 to 1), 1045(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(999: 35.000000), (1000: 55.000000), (1045: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(980: 4), (999: 4), (1000: 4), (1009: 2), (1010: 1), (1045: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 200 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
