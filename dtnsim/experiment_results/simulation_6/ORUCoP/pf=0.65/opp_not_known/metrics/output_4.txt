The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1697(1 to 11), 1716(3 to 10), 1717(4 to 6), 1718(7 to 9), 1722(12 to 4), 1723(12 to 5), 1756(8 to 1), 1772(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1697: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1697: 6), (1716: 6), (1717: 4), (1722: 3), (1723: 2), (1756: 3), (1772: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 207 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
