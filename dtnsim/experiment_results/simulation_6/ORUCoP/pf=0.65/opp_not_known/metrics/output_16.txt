The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
563(1 to 11), 582(3 to 10), 583(4 to 6), 584(7 to 9), 590(12 to 4), 591(12 to 5), 628(8 to 1), 631(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(583: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(563: 6), (583: 4), (590: 3), (591: 2), (631: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 155 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
