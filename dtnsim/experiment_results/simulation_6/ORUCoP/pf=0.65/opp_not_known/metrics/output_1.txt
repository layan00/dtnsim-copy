The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
572(1 to 11), 591(3 to 10), 592(4 to 6), 593(7 to 9), 601(12 to 4), 602(12 to 5), 638(8 to 1), 643(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(591: 15.000000), (601: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 4), (591: 6), (592: 4), (601: 3), (602: 2), (643: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 200 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
