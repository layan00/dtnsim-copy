The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
600(1 to 11), 621(3 to 10), 622(4 to 6), 623(7 to 9), 633(12 to 4), 634(12 to 5), 668(8 to 1), 673(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(621: 15.000000), (622: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(600: 4), (621: 6), (622: 4), (623: 2), (633: 3), (634: 2), (673: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 64 calls to RUCoP, which took 252 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
