The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1320(1 to 11), 1338(3 to 10), 1339(4 to 6), 1340(7 to 9), 1345(12 to 4), 1346(12 to 5), 1383(8 to 1), 1390(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1338: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1320: 4), (1338: 3), (1339: 4), (1345: 2), (1346: 2), (1390: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 203 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
