The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1731(1 to 11), 1750(3 to 10), 1751(4 to 6), 1752(7 to 9), 1759(12 to 4), 1760(12 to 5), 1798(8 to 1), 1805(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1805: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1731: 4), (1751: 3), (1752: 1), (1759: 3), (1760: 2), (1805: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 199 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
