The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
186(1 to 11), 203(3 to 10), 204(4 to 6), 205(7 to 9), 214(12 to 4), 215(12 to 5), 247(8 to 1), 252(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(186: 60.000000), (204: 35.000000), (205: 25.000000), (252: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 5), (204: 4), (205: 3), (214: 2), (215: 1), (252: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 205 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
