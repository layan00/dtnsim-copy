The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1700(1 to 11), 1718(3 to 10), 1719(4 to 6), 1720(7 to 9), 1728(12 to 4), 1729(12 to 5), 1759(8 to 1), 1766(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1719: 35.000000), (1766: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1700: 5), (1719: 6), (1720: 2), (1728: 2), (1729: 1), (1766: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 60 calls to RUCoP, which took 243 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
