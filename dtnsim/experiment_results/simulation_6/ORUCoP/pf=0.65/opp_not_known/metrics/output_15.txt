The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(1 to 11), 205(3 to 10), 206(4 to 6), 207(7 to 9), 213(12 to 4), 214(12 to 5), 250(8 to 1), 253(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(185: 60.000000), (206: 55.000000), (213: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 7), (206: 4), (213: 4), (214: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 199 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
