The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1318(1 to 11), 1336(3 to 10), 1337(4 to 6), 1338(7 to 9), 1345(12 to 4), 1346(12 to 5), 1380(8 to 1), 1385(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1337: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1318: 6), (1336: 2), (1337: 6), (1345: 1), (1346: 2), (1380: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 230 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
