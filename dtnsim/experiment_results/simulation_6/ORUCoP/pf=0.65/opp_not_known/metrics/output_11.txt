The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
581(1 to 11), 599(3 to 10), 600(4 to 6), 601(7 to 9), 611(12 to 4), 612(12 to 5), 649(8 to 1), 653(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(581: 60.000000), (600: 55.000000), (601: 45.000000), (611: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(581: 6), (599: 4), (600: 4), (601: 4), (611: 4), (612: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 194 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
