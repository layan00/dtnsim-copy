The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1769(1 to 11), 1787(3 to 10), 1788(4 to 6), 1789(7 to 9), 1795(12 to 4), 1796(12 to 5), 1828(8 to 1), 1835(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1787: 35.000000), (1788: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1769: 4), (1787: 3), (1788: 4), (1789: 1), (1795: 2), (1796: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 191 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
