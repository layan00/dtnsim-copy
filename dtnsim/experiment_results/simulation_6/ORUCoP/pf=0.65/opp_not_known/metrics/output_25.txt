The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(1 to 11), 189(3 to 10), 190(4 to 6), 191(7 to 9), 196(12 to 4), 197(12 to 5), 232(8 to 1), 236(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 4), (190: 4), (196: 1), (197: 2), (236: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 209 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
