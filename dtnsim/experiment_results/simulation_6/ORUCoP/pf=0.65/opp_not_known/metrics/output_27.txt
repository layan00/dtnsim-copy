The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
942(1 to 11), 961(3 to 10), 962(4 to 6), 963(7 to 9), 972(12 to 4), 973(12 to 5), 1008(8 to 1), 1016(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(942: 60.000000), (961: 35.000000), (972: 25.000000), (1016: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(942: 6), (961: 4), (962: 4), (963: 1), (972: 4), (973: 1), (1016: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 215 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
