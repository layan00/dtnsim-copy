The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1316(1 to 11), 1335(3 to 10), 1336(4 to 6), 1337(7 to 9), 1342(12 to 4), 1343(12 to 5), 1379(8 to 1), 1389(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1336: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1316: 4), (1335: 1), (1336: 6), (1337: 1), (1342: 1), (1343: 2), (1379: 1), (1389: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 205 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
