The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
183(1 to 11), 201(3 to 10), 202(4 to 6), 203(7 to 9), 213(12 to 4), 214(12 to 5), 245(8 to 1), 255(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(183: 60.000000), (203: 25.000000), (255: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(183: 6), (201: 4), (202: 3), (203: 3), (213: 2), (214: 1), (255: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 238 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
