The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
178(1 to 11), 196(3 to 10), 197(4 to 6), 198(7 to 9), 206(12 to 4), 207(12 to 5), 240(8 to 1), 243(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(178: 4), (196: 2), (197: 4), (206: 1), (207: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 196 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 178: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
