The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1373(1 to 11), 1393(3 to 10), 1394(4 to 6), 1395(7 to 9), 1408(12 to 4), 1409(12 to 5), 1445(8 to 1), 1455(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1393: 35.000000), (1394: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1373: 4), (1393: 6), (1394: 4), (1395: 3), (1408: 2), (1409: 2), (1445: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 62 calls to RUCoP, which took 243 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
