The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
53(1 to 11), 61(3 to 10), 62(4 to 6), 63(7 to 9), 73(12 to 4), 74(12 to 5), 81(8 to 1), 96(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(61: 35.000000), (62: 25.000000), (73: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(53: 1), (61: 5), (62: 6), (63: 3), (73: 4), (96: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
