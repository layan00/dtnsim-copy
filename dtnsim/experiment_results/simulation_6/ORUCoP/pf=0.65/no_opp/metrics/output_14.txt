The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
394(1 to 11), 399(3 to 10), 400(4 to 6), 401(7 to 9), 409(12 to 4), 410(12 to 5), 415(8 to 1), 422(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(394: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(394: 4), (399: 3), (401: 2), (409: 1), (422: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 394: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 399: (to: 1, time: 25.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 399: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 394: (to: 9, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6:
