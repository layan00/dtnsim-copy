The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
178(1 to 11), 181(3 to 10), 182(4 to 6), 183(7 to 9), 191(12 to 4), 192(12 to 5), 196(8 to 1), 202(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(178: 3), (181: 1), (182: 2), (202: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 178: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 181: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 182: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 178: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 178: (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 202: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000),
