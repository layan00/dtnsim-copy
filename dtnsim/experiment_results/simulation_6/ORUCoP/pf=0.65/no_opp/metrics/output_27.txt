The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
176(1 to 11), 181(3 to 10), 182(4 to 6), 183(7 to 9), 191(12 to 4), 192(12 to 5), 201(8 to 1), 211(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(181: 35.000000), (191: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(181: 6), (183: 1), (191: 8), (192: 1), (211: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
