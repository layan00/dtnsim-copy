The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
257(1 to 11), 261(3 to 10), 262(4 to 6), 263(7 to 9), 268(12 to 4), 269(12 to 5), 278(8 to 1), 286(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(257: 3), (261: 3), (268: 2), (286: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 257: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 257: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 261: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3:
