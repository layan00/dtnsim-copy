The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
296(1 to 11), 302(3 to 10), 303(4 to 6), 304(7 to 9), 315(12 to 4), 316(12 to 5), 327(8 to 1), 346(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(302: 35.000000), (303: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(296: 3), (302: 6), (303: 4), (304: 7), (315: 2), (316: 2), (327: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
