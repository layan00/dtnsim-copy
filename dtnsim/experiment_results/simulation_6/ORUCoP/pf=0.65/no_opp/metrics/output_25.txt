The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
28(1 to 11), 31(3 to 10), 32(4 to 6), 33(7 to 9), 38(12 to 4), 39(12 to 5), 46(8 to 1), 50(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(28: 1), (38: 1), (50: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 28: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 50: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 38: (to: 11, time: 40.000000), 
Node 13: 
Node 14: 
Node 15:
