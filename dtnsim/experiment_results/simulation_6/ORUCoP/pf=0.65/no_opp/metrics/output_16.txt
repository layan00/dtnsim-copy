The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
113(1 to 11), 118(3 to 10), 119(4 to 6), 120(7 to 9), 126(12 to 4), 127(12 to 5), 137(8 to 1), 140(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(119: 1), (126: 4), (127: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 119: (to: 7, time: 25.000000),
