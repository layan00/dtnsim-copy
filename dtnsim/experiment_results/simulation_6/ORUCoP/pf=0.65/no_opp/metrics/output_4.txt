The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
309(1 to 11), 314(3 to 10), 315(4 to 6), 316(7 to 9), 320(12 to 4), 321(12 to 5), 327(8 to 1), 347(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(315: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(309: 2), (314: 4), (315: 5), (320: 2), (327: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
