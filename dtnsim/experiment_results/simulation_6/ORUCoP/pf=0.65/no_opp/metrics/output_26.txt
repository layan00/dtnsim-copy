The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
93(1 to 11), 96(3 to 10), 97(4 to 6), 98(7 to 9), 104(12 to 4), 105(12 to 5), 110(8 to 1), 119(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(93: 2), (96: 2), (104: 2), (110: 1), (119: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 93: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 96: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 96: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 93: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 119: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 110: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 119: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 104: (to: 8, time: 100.000000), (to: 8, time: 100.000000),
