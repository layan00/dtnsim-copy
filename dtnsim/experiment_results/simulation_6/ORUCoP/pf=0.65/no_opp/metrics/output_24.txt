The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
389(1 to 11), 393(3 to 10), 394(4 to 6), 395(7 to 9), 402(12 to 4), 403(12 to 5), 408(8 to 1), 416(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(393: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(389: 6), (393: 3), (395: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 389: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 389: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 393: (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 393: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4:
