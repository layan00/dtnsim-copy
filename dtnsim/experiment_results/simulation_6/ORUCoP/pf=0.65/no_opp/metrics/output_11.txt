The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
126(1 to 11), 130(3 to 10), 131(4 to 6), 132(7 to 9), 143(12 to 4), 144(12 to 5), 155(8 to 1), 159(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(132: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(126: 2), (130: 2), (132: 4), (143: 4), (144: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 126: (to: 5, time: 30.000000),
