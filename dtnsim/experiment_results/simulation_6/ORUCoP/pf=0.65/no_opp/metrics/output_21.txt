The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
148(1 to 11), 155(3 to 10), 156(4 to 6), 157(7 to 9), 164(12 to 4), 165(12 to 5), 169(8 to 1), 175(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(156: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(155: 3), (156: 2), (157: 2), (175: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 155: (to: 1, time: 25.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 155: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 156: (to: 7, time: 25.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 175: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 156: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 157: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 175: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000),
