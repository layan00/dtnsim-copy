The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
329(1 to 11), 334(3 to 10), 335(4 to 6), 336(7 to 9), 346(12 to 4), 347(12 to 5), 350(8 to 1), 358(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(358: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(329: 6), (336: 2), (358: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 329: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 329: (to: 9, time: 30.000000), (to: 9, time: 30.000000), 
Bundle 358: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 358: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 336: (to: 8, time: 25.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 329: (to: 10, time: 50.000000), (to: 10, time: 50.000000),
