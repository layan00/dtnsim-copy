The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
241(1 to 11), 245(3 to 10), 246(4 to 6), 247(7 to 9), 254(12 to 4), 255(12 to 5), 261(8 to 1), 264(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(241: 2), (245: 1), (254: 1), (261: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 241: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 245: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 241: (to: 9, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 261: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 254: (to: 11, time: 40.000000),
