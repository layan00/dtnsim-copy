The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
116(1 to 11), 121(3 to 10), 122(4 to 6), 123(7 to 9), 129(12 to 4), 130(12 to 5), 135(8 to 1), 140(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(129: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(121: 2), (129: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 121: (to: 1, time: 25.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 121: (to: 2, time: 25.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 129: (to: 4, time: 120.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 129: (to: 11, time: 40.000000), (to: 8, time: 100.000000), 
Node 13: 
Node 14: 
Node 15:
