The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
267(1 to 11), 272(3 to 10), 273(4 to 6), 274(7 to 9), 282(12 to 4), 283(12 to 5), 292(8 to 1), 296(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(267: 2), (274: 2), (282: 2), (283: 2), (292: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 267: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 274: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 292: (to: 4, time: 45.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Bundle 283: (to: 10, time: 35.000000), 
Node 12: 
Bundle 282: (to: 11, time: 35.000000), (to: 11, time: 35.000000),
