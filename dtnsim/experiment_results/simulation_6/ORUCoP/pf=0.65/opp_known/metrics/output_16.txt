The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
437(1 to 11), 442(3 to 10), 443(4 to 6), 444(7 to 9), 450(12 to 4), 451(12 to 5), 480(8 to 1), 483(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(443: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(437: 4), (443: 4), (450: 4), (451: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
