The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
744(1 to 11), 752(3 to 10), 753(4 to 6), 754(7 to 9), 764(12 to 4), 765(12 to 5), 792(8 to 1), 797(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(752: 15.000000), (753: 35.000000), (797: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(744: 4), (752: 4), (753: 4), (754: 2), (764: 2), (765: 1), (797: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
