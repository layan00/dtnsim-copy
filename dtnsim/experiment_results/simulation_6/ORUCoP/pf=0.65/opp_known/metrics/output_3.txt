The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
946(1 to 11), 951(3 to 10), 952(4 to 6), 953(7 to 9), 959(12 to 4), 960(12 to 5), 986(8 to 1), 993(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(946: 40.000000), (951: 55.000000), (952: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(946: 7), (951: 4), (952: 6), (959: 1), (960: 1), (986: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
