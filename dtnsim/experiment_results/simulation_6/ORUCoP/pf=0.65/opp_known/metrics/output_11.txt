The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
443(1 to 11), 447(3 to 10), 448(4 to 6), 449(7 to 9), 458(12 to 4), 459(12 to 5), 494(8 to 1), 497(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(443: 60.000000), (448: 55.000000), (449: 45.000000), (459: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(443: 6), (447: 1), (448: 5), (449: 4), (458: 8), (459: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
