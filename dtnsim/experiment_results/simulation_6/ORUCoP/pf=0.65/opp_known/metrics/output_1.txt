The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
442(1 to 11), 447(3 to 10), 448(4 to 6), 449(7 to 9), 455(12 to 4), 456(12 to 5), 482(8 to 1), 487(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(447: 15.000000), (455: 85.000000), (456: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(442: 4), (447: 4), (448: 4), (455: 3), (456: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
