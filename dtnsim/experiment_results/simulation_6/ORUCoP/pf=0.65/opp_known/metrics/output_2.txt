The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
699(1 to 11), 702(3 to 10), 703(4 to 6), 704(7 to 9), 711(12 to 4), 712(12 to 5), 734(8 to 1), 738(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(703: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(699: 4), (702: 1), (703: 6), (738: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 699: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2:
