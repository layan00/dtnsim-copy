The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1212(1 to 11), 1219(3 to 10), 1220(4 to 6), 1221(7 to 9), 1228(12 to 4), 1229(12 to 5), 1248(8 to 1), 1254(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1220: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1212: 5), (1220: 6), (1221: 2), (1254: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1212: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000),
