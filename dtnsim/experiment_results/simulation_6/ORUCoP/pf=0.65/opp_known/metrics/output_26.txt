The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
415(1 to 11), 418(3 to 10), 419(4 to 6), 420(7 to 9), 425(12 to 4), 426(12 to 5), 449(8 to 1), 464(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(419: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(415: 4), (418: 4), (419: 6), (425: 2), (426: 2), (449: 4), (464: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
