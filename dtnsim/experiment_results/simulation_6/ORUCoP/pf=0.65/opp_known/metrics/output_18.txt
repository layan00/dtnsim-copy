The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
948(1 to 11), 953(3 to 10), 954(4 to 6), 955(7 to 9), 959(12 to 4), 960(12 to 5), 986(8 to 1), 999(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(954: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(948: 4), (953: 2), (954: 6), (959: 1), (960: 1), (986: 4), (999: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
