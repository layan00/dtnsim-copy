The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
174(1 to 11), 180(3 to 10), 181(4 to 6), 182(7 to 9), 188(12 to 4), 189(12 to 5), 210(8 to 1), 214(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(174: 60.000000), (181: 35.000000), (214: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(174: 6), (181: 4), (214: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 174: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 181: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 174: (to: 14, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 181: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 214: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 214: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 174: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 11:
