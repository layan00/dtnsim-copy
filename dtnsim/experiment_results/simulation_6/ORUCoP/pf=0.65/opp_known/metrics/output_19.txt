The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1210(1 to 11), 1215(3 to 10), 1216(4 to 6), 1217(7 to 9), 1223(12 to 4), 1224(12 to 5), 1245(8 to 1), 1249(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1216: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1210: 4), (1216: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1210: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 1216: (to: 7, time: 25.000000), (to: 14, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 1216: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10:
