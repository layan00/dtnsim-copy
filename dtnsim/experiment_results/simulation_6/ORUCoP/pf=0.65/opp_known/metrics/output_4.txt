The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1211(1 to 11), 1216(3 to 10), 1217(4 to 6), 1218(7 to 9), 1222(12 to 4), 1223(12 to 5), 1246(8 to 1), 1262(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1211: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1211: 6), (1216: 4), (1217: 4), (1222: 2), (1223: 2), (1246: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
