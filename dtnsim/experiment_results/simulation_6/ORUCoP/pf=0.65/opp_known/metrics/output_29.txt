The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1268(1 to 11), 1273(3 to 10), 1274(4 to 6), 1275(7 to 9), 1281(12 to 4), 1282(12 to 5), 1312(8 to 1), 1318(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1318: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1268: 4), (1274: 4), (1281: 4), (1282: 3), (1318: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
