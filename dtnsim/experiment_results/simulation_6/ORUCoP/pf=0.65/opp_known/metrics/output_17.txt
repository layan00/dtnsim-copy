The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
690(1 to 11), 695(3 to 10), 696(4 to 6), 697(7 to 9), 703(12 to 4), 704(12 to 5), 726(8 to 1), 735(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(690: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(690: 6), (695: 1), (696: 4), (726: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
