The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
171(1 to 11), 175(3 to 10), 176(4 to 6), 177(7 to 9), 187(12 to 4), 188(12 to 5), 209(8 to 1), 218(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(171: 60.000000), (175: 55.000000), (177: 25.000000), (218: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(171: 6), (175: 6), (176: 4), (177: 3), (218: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 233 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
