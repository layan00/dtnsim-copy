The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1284(1 to 11), 1288(3 to 10), 1289(4 to 6), 1290(7 to 9), 1296(12 to 4), 1297(12 to 5), 1319(8 to 1), 1328(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1288: 35.000000), (1289: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1284: 4), (1288: 6), (1289: 4), (1290: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
