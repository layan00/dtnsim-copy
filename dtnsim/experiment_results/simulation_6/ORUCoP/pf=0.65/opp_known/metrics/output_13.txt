The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
999(1 to 11), 1005(3 to 10), 1006(4 to 6), 1007(7 to 9), 1018(12 to 4), 1019(12 to 5), 1060(8 to 1), 1074(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1006: 45.000000), (1019: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(999: 4), (1005: 2), (1006: 4), (1007: 8), (1018: 18), (1019: 7), (1060: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
