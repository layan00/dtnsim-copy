The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1296(1 to 11), 1303(3 to 10), 1304(4 to 6), 1305(7 to 9), 1312(12 to 4), 1313(12 to 5), 1337(8 to 1), 1343(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1296: 60.000000), (1303: 15.000000), (1304: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1296: 6), (1303: 6), (1304: 4), (1305: 2), (1312: 1), (1313: 1), (1343: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
