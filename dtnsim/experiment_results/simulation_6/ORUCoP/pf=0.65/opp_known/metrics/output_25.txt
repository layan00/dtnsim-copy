The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
160(1 to 11), 163(3 to 10), 164(4 to 6), 165(7 to 9), 170(12 to 4), 171(12 to 5), 196(8 to 1), 200(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(160: 4), (164: 4), (170: 1), (171: 1), (200: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 160: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2:

Node 4: 
Bundle 164: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 55.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 200: (to: 14, time: 55.000000), 
Node 6:
