The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
948(1 to 11), 952(3 to 10), 953(4 to 6), 954(7 to 9), 959(12 to 4), 960(12 to 5), 988(8 to 1), 997(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(952: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(948: 4), (952: 6), (953: 4), (959: 2), (960: 2), (997: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
