The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(1 to 11), 180(3 to 10), 181(4 to 6), 182(7 to 9), 188(12 to 4), 189(12 to 5), 218(8 to 1), 221(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(173: 40.000000), (181: 55.000000), (188: 85.000000), (189: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 7), (181: 4), (188: 4), (189: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
