The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1018(1 to 11), 1023(3 to 10), 1024(4 to 6), 1025(7 to 9), 1030(12 to 4), 1031(12 to 5), 1052(8 to 1), 1059(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1023: 55.000000), (1024: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1018: 4), (1023: 7), (1024: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
