The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
896(1 to 11), 905(3 to 10), 906(4 to 6), 907(7 to 9), 924(12 to 4), 925(12 to 5), 957(8 to 1), 969(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(905: 15.000000), (906: 35.000000), (924: 25.000000), (925: 45.000000), (969: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(896: 5), (905: 6), (906: 5), (907: 8), (924: 6), (925: 6), (969: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
