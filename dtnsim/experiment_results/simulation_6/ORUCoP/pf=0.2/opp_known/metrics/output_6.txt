The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
566(1 to 11), 576(3 to 10), 577(4 to 6), 578(7 to 9), 589(12 to 4), 590(12 to 5), 632(8 to 1), 644(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(566: 40.000000), (576: 15.000000), (577: 35.000000), (578: 45.000000), (589: 85.000000), (590: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(566: 7), (576: 6), (577: 4), (578: 3), (589: 18), (590: 9), (644: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
