The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(1 to 11), 218(3 to 10), 219(4 to 6), 220(7 to 9), 230(12 to 4), 231(12 to 5), 261(8 to 1), 276(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 40.000000), (218: 55.000000), (219: 35.000000), (220: 25.000000), (230: 25.000000), (231: 45.000000), (261: 35.000000), (276: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 7), (218: 7), (219: 5), (220: 5), (230: 5), (231: 8), (261: 7), (276: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
