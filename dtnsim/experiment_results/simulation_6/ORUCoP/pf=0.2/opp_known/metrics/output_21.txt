The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
558(1 to 11), 567(3 to 10), 568(4 to 6), 569(7 to 9), 580(12 to 4), 581(12 to 5), 618(8 to 1), 629(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(567: 15.000000), (568: 35.000000), (569: 45.000000), (581: 85.000000), (629: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(558: 6), (567: 6), (568: 4), (569: 4), (580: 8), (581: 8), (618: 4), (629: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
