The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1588(1 to 11), 1599(3 to 10), 1600(4 to 6), 1601(7 to 9), 1619(12 to 4), 1620(12 to 5), 1672(8 to 1), 1684(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1588: 40.000000), (1599: 15.000000), (1600: 35.000000), (1619: 85.000000), (1620: 85.000000), (1672: 35.000000), (1684: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1588: 7), (1599: 6), (1600: 8), (1601: 12), (1619: 13), (1620: 7), (1672: 7), (1684: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
