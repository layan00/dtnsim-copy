The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1295(1 to 11), 1303(3 to 10), 1304(4 to 6), 1305(7 to 9), 1314(12 to 4), 1315(12 to 5), 1343(8 to 1), 1357(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1295: 40.000000), (1303: 35.000000), (1304: 45.000000), (1305: 45.000000), (1315: 85.000000), (1357: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1295: 7), (1303: 6), (1304: 4), (1305: 4), (1314: 2), (1315: 5), (1343: 3), (1357: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
