The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1240(1 to 11), 1249(3 to 10), 1250(4 to 6), 1251(7 to 9), 1260(12 to 4), 1261(12 to 5), 1301(8 to 1), 1318(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1240: 40.000000), (1249: 35.000000), (1250: 35.000000), (1261: 85.000000), (1301: 35.000000), (1318: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1240: 7), (1249: 6), (1250: 4), (1251: 2), (1260: 14), (1261: 9), (1301: 7), (1318: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
