The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
582(1 to 11), 591(3 to 10), 592(4 to 6), 593(7 to 9), 613(12 to 4), 614(12 to 5), 659(8 to 1), 668(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(582: 60.000000), (591: 15.000000), (592: 35.000000), (593: 45.000000), (613: 85.000000), (614: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(582: 7), (591: 4), (592: 5), (593: 14), (613: 18), (614: 9), (668: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
