The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
204(1 to 11), 212(3 to 10), 213(4 to 6), 214(7 to 9), 229(12 to 4), 230(12 to 5), 270(8 to 1), 288(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(204: 60.000000), (212: 15.000000), (213: 35.000000), (214: 25.000000), (230: 85.000000), (288: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(204: 7), (212: 6), (213: 5), (214: 5), (229: 16), (230: 6), (270: 4), (288: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
