The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1227(1 to 11), 1234(3 to 10), 1235(4 to 6), 1236(7 to 9), 1247(12 to 4), 1248(12 to 5), 1275(8 to 1), 1288(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1227: 60.000000), (1234: 55.000000), (1235: 35.000000), (1236: 45.000000), (1247: 85.000000), (1248: 85.000000), (1275: 35.000000), (1288: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1227: 7), (1234: 7), (1235: 4), (1236: 3), (1247: 5), (1248: 7), (1275: 7), (1288: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
