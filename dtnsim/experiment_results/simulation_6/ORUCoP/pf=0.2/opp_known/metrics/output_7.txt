The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
925(1 to 11), 934(3 to 10), 935(4 to 6), 936(7 to 9), 950(12 to 4), 951(12 to 5), 995(8 to 1), 1009(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(925: 40.000000), (934: 15.000000), (935: 35.000000), (936: 45.000000), (951: 85.000000), (995: 35.000000), (1009: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(925: 7), (934: 6), (935: 8), (936: 10), (950: 8), (951: 8), (995: 7), (1009: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
