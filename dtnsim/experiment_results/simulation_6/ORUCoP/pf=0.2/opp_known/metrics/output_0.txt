The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 11), 221(3 to 10), 222(4 to 6), 223(7 to 9), 246(12 to 4), 247(12 to 5), 296(8 to 1), 314(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 60.000000), (221: 15.000000), (222: 55.000000), (314: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 7), (221: 8), (222: 9), (223: 12), (246: 13), (247: 5), (296: 6), (314: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 239 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
