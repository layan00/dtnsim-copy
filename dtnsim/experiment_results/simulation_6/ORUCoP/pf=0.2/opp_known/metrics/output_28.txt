The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1274(1 to 11), 1283(3 to 10), 1284(4 to 6), 1285(7 to 9), 1295(12 to 4), 1296(12 to 5), 1337(8 to 1), 1345(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1274: 40.000000), (1283: 55.000000), (1284: 35.000000), (1295: 85.000000), (1296: 85.000000), (1337: 35.000000), (1345: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1274: 7), (1283: 4), (1284: 4), (1285: 3), (1295: 13), (1296: 9), (1337: 7), (1345: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
