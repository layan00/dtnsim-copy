The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
900(1 to 11), 909(3 to 10), 910(4 to 6), 911(7 to 9), 928(12 to 4), 929(12 to 5), 980(8 to 1), 997(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(900: 60.000000), (909: 15.000000), (910: 35.000000), (929: 85.000000), (980: 35.000000), (997: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(900: 6), (909: 6), (910: 8), (911: 16), (928: 16), (929: 9), (980: 7), (997: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
