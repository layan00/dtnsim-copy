The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 11), 214(3 to 10), 215(4 to 6), 216(7 to 9), 225(12 to 4), 226(12 to 5), 250(8 to 1), 263(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 20.000000), (214: 15.000000), (215: 35.000000), (216: 45.000000), (225: 85.000000), (226: 85.000000), (250: 35.000000), (263: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 7), (214: 6), (215: 4), (216: 4), (225: 4), (226: 5), (250: 7), (263: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
