The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1603(1 to 11), 1613(3 to 10), 1614(4 to 6), 1615(7 to 9), 1628(12 to 4), 1629(12 to 5), 1666(8 to 1), 1682(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1603: 40.000000), (1613: 35.000000), (1614: 35.000000), (1615: 45.000000), (1628: 25.000000), (1629: 45.000000), (1666: 35.000000), (1682: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1603: 7), (1613: 6), (1614: 8), (1615: 10), (1628: 10), (1629: 8), (1666: 7), (1682: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
