The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
875(1 to 11), 882(3 to 10), 883(4 to 6), 884(7 to 9), 896(12 to 4), 897(12 to 5), 934(8 to 1), 945(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(875: 60.000000), (882: 35.000000), (883: 35.000000), (896: 85.000000), (897: 85.000000), (934: 35.000000), (945: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(875: 5), (882: 3), (883: 4), (884: 1), (896: 18), (897: 9), (934: 7), (945: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
