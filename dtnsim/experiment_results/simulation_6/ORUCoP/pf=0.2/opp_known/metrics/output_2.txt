The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
943(1 to 11), 949(3 to 10), 950(4 to 6), 951(7 to 9), 963(12 to 4), 964(12 to 5), 1002(8 to 1), 1019(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(943: 60.000000), (949: 35.000000), (950: 35.000000), (964: 85.000000), (1002: 35.000000), (1019: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(943: 7), (949: 6), (950: 4), (951: 3), (963: 16), (964: 6), (1002: 7), (1019: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
