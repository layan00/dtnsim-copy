The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 11), 249(3 to 10), 250(4 to 6), 251(7 to 9), 272(12 to 4), 273(12 to 5), 309(8 to 1), 332(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 60.000000), (249: 25.000000), (250: 25.000000), (251: 25.000000), (272: 25.000000), (273: 15.000000), (309: 15.000000), (332: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 6), (249: 10), (250: 4), (251: 9), (272: 5), (273: 4), (309: 4), (332: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 239 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
