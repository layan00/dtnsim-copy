The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
683(1 to 11), 706(3 to 10), 707(4 to 6), 708(7 to 9), 727(12 to 4), 728(12 to 5), 763(8 to 1), 777(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(706: 25.000000), (707: 45.000000), (708: 25.000000), (727: 85.000000), (728: 15.000000), (777: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(683: 6), (706: 10), (707: 4), (708: 4), (727: 5), (728: 5), (763: 1), (777: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 60 calls to RUCoP, which took 294 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
