The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2065(1 to 11), 2089(3 to 10), 2090(4 to 6), 2091(7 to 9), 2102(12 to 4), 2103(12 to 5), 2140(8 to 1), 2160(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2065: 40.000000), (2089: 35.000000), (2090: 25.000000), (2102: 25.000000), (2140: 15.000000), (2160: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2065: 8), (2089: 6), (2090: 4), (2091: 3), (2102: 5), (2103: 2), (2140: 4), (2160: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 212 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
