The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
695(1 to 11), 720(3 to 10), 721(4 to 6), 722(7 to 9), 743(12 to 4), 744(12 to 5), 779(8 to 1), 790(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(720: 25.000000), (721: 45.000000), (722: 45.000000), (743: 85.000000), (790: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(695: 6), (720: 10), (721: 4), (722: 8), (743: 5), (744: 3), (790: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 249 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
