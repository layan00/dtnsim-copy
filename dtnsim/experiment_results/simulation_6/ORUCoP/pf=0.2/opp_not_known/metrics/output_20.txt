The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(1 to 11), 248(3 to 10), 249(4 to 6), 250(7 to 9), 270(12 to 4), 271(12 to 5), 309(8 to 1), 324(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 40.000000), (248: 25.000000), (249: 25.000000), (250: 25.000000), (270: 25.000000), (324: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 8), (248: 10), (249: 4), (250: 7), (270: 4), (271: 2), (324: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 225 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
