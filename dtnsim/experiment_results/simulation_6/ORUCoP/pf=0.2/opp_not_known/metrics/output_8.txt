The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1632(1 to 11), 1656(3 to 10), 1657(4 to 6), 1658(7 to 9), 1670(12 to 4), 1671(12 to 5), 1708(8 to 1), 1726(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1632: 40.000000), (1656: 35.000000), (1657: 25.000000), (1670: 85.000000), (1708: 15.000000), (1726: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1632: 8), (1656: 6), (1657: 4), (1658: 3), (1670: 4), (1671: 2), (1708: 4), (1726: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 220 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
