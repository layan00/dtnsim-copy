The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
688(1 to 11), 712(3 to 10), 713(4 to 6), 714(7 to 9), 733(12 to 4), 734(12 to 5), 771(8 to 1), 785(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(688: 40.000000), (712: 25.000000), (713: 45.000000), (714: 25.000000), (733: 85.000000), (734: 15.000000), (785: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(688: 8), (712: 10), (713: 4), (714: 4), (733: 6), (734: 5), (785: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 250 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
