The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(1 to 11), 244(3 to 10), 245(4 to 6), 246(7 to 9), 258(12 to 4), 259(12 to 5), 300(8 to 1), 314(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 40.000000), (245: 35.000000), (246: 25.000000), (258: 25.000000), (300: 15.000000), (314: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 8), (244: 2), (245: 5), (246: 7), (258: 5), (259: 2), (300: 4), (314: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 220 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
