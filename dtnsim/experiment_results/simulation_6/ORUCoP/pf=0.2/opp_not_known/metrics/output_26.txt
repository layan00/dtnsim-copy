The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
675(1 to 11), 699(3 to 10), 700(4 to 6), 701(7 to 9), 717(12 to 4), 718(12 to 5), 765(8 to 1), 785(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(675: 40.000000), (699: 35.000000), (700: 35.000000), (701: 25.000000), (765: 15.000000), (785: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(675: 8), (699: 18), (700: 5), (701: 6), (717: 3), (718: 2), (765: 4), (785: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 245 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
