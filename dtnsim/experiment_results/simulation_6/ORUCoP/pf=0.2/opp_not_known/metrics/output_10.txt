The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 11), 235(3 to 10), 236(4 to 6), 237(7 to 9), 251(12 to 4), 252(12 to 5), 285(8 to 1), 300(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 60.000000), (235: 15.000000), (236: 25.000000), (237: 25.000000), (251: 85.000000), (300: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 5), (235: 6), (236: 4), (237: 4), (251: 4), (252: 2), (285: 3), (300: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 220 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
