The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 11), 219(3 to 10), 220(4 to 6), 221(7 to 9), 229(12 to 4), 230(12 to 5), 242(8 to 1), 256(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 60.000000), (220: 45.000000), (221: 45.000000), (242: 15.000000), (256: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 5), (219: 2), (220: 4), (221: 3), (229: 5), (230: 1), (242: 4), (256: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
