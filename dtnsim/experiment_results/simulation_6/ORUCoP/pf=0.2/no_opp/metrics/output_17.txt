The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
353(1 to 11), 360(3 to 10), 361(4 to 6), 362(7 to 9), 374(12 to 4), 375(12 to 5), 388(8 to 1), 403(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(353: 60.000000), (360: 35.000000), (375: 15.000000), (403: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(353: 6), (360: 3), (361: 2), (362: 1), (374: 6), (375: 4), (388: 2), (403: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
