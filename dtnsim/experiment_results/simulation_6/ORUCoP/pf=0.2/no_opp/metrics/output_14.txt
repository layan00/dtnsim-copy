The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
663(1 to 11), 673(3 to 10), 674(4 to 6), 675(7 to 9), 696(12 to 4), 697(12 to 5), 711(8 to 1), 735(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(663: 60.000000), (673: 25.000000), (674: 45.000000), (675: 25.000000), (697: 15.000000), (711: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(663: 8), (673: 6), (674: 4), (675: 9), (696: 8), (697: 4), (711: 4), (735: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
