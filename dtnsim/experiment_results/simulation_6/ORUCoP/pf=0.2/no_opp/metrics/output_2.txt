The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
407(1 to 11), 413(3 to 10), 414(4 to 6), 415(7 to 9), 427(12 to 4), 428(12 to 5), 442(8 to 1), 462(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(407: 60.000000), (413: 35.000000), (414: 25.000000), (427: 25.000000), (462: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(407: 8), (413: 6), (414: 4), (415: 3), (427: 7), (428: 2), (442: 3), (462: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
