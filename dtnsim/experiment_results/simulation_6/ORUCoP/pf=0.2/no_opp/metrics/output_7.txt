The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
397(1 to 11), 405(3 to 10), 406(4 to 6), 407(7 to 9), 425(12 to 4), 426(12 to 5), 438(8 to 1), 460(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(397: 60.000000), (405: 25.000000), (406: 45.000000), (425: 25.000000), (438: 15.000000), (460: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(397: 8), (405: 6), (406: 4), (407: 8), (425: 7), (426: 2), (438: 4), (460: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
