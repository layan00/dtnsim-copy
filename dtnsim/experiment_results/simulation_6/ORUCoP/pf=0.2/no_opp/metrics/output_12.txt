The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
341(1 to 11), 348(3 to 10), 349(4 to 6), 350(7 to 9), 359(12 to 4), 360(12 to 5), 367(8 to 1), 376(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(348: 35.000000), (349: 45.000000), (350: 45.000000), (359: 25.000000), (376: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(348: 5), (349: 2), (350: 4), (359: 4), (376: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
