The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
563(1 to 11), 570(3 to 10), 571(4 to 6), 572(7 to 9), 584(12 to 4), 585(12 to 5), 594(8 to 1), 608(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(570: 35.000000), (571: 45.000000), (572: 45.000000), (608: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(563: 6), (570: 6), (571: 2), (572: 4), (584: 2), (585: 1), (594: 1), (608: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
