The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
538(1 to 11), 546(3 to 10), 547(4 to 6), 548(7 to 9), 560(12 to 4), 561(12 to 5), 573(8 to 1), 596(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(546: 35.000000), (547: 25.000000), (560: 25.000000), (573: 15.000000), (596: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(538: 6), (546: 6), (547: 4), (548: 2), (560: 8), (561: 3), (573: 4), (596: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
