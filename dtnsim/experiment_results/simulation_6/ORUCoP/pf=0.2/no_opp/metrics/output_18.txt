The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
502(1 to 11), 509(3 to 10), 510(4 to 6), 511(7 to 9), 522(12 to 4), 523(12 to 5), 533(8 to 1), 548(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(502: 60.000000), (510: 45.000000), (511: 45.000000), (522: 85.000000), (533: 15.000000), (548: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(502: 5), (509: 2), (510: 4), (511: 3), (522: 5), (533: 4), (548: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
