The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 11), 89(3 to 10), 90(4 to 6), 91(7 to 9), 114(12 to 4), 115(12 to 5), 128(8 to 1), 152(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 60.000000), (89: 25.000000), (90: 25.000000), (91: 25.000000), (114: 25.000000), (115: 15.000000), (128: 15.000000), (152: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 8), (89: 10), (90: 4), (91: 8), (114: 5), (115: 4), (128: 4), (152: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 86 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
