The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
539(1 to 11), 547(3 to 10), 548(4 to 6), 549(7 to 9), 562(12 to 4), 563(12 to 5), 576(8 to 1), 587(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(548: 45.000000), (562: 25.000000), (587: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(539: 6), (547: 1), (548: 2), (549: 3), (562: 8), (563: 3), (576: 1), (587: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
