The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
646(1 to 11), 654(3 to 10), 655(4 to 6), 656(7 to 9), 671(12 to 4), 672(12 to 5), 683(8 to 1), 707(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(646: 60.000000), (654: 25.000000), (655: 25.000000), (672: 15.000000), (683: 15.000000), (707: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(646: 4), (654: 7), (655: 4), (671: 7), (672: 4), (683: 4), (707: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
