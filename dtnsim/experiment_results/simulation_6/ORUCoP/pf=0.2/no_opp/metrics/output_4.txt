The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
708(1 to 11), 714(3 to 10), 715(4 to 6), 716(7 to 9), 726(12 to 4), 727(12 to 5), 740(8 to 1), 760(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(708: 60.000000), (714: 35.000000), (715: 25.000000), (716: 45.000000), (726: 25.000000), (740: 15.000000), (760: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(708: 8), (714: 6), (715: 4), (716: 4), (726: 6), (727: 1), (740: 4), (760: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
