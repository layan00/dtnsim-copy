The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
707(1 to 11), 716(3 to 10), 717(4 to 6), 718(7 to 9), 733(12 to 4), 734(12 to 5), 748(8 to 1), 769(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(707: 60.000000), (716: 35.000000), (717: 25.000000), (718: 45.000000), (733: 25.000000), (748: 15.000000), (769: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(707: 8), (716: 6), (717: 4), (718: 10), (733: 6), (734: 1), (748: 4), (769: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
