The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 11), 216(3 to 10), 217(4 to 6), 218(7 to 9), 230(12 to 4), 231(12 to 5), 243(8 to 1), 251(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(216: 35.000000), (218: 45.000000), (251: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 2), (216: 6), (218: 3), (230: 4), (231: 2), (243: 1), (251: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
