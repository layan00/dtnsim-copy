The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
570(1 to 11), 579(3 to 10), 580(4 to 6), 581(7 to 9), 594(12 to 4), 595(12 to 5), 610(8 to 1), 630(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(570: 60.000000), (579: 35.000000), (580: 25.000000), (610: 15.000000), (630: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(570: 8), (579: 6), (580: 4), (581: 8), (594: 4), (595: 1), (610: 4), (630: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
