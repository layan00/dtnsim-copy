The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
234(1 to 11), 243(3 to 10), 244(4 to 6), 245(7 to 9), 261(12 to 4), 262(12 to 5), 274(8 to 1), 292(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 60.000000), (243: 25.000000), (244: 45.000000), (245: 45.000000), (262: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(234: 8), (243: 7), (244: 2), (245: 3), (261: 8), (262: 4), (292: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
