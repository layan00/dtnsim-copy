The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
77(1 to 11), 85(3 to 10), 86(4 to 6), 87(7 to 9), 98(12 to 4), 99(12 to 5), 109(8 to 1), 127(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(87: 25.000000), (98: 25.000000), (109: 15.000000), (127: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(77: 4), (85: 2), (86: 4), (87: 5), (98: 5), (109: 4), (127: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
