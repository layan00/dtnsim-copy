The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
71(1 to 11), 80(3 to 10), 81(4 to 6), 82(7 to 9), 97(12 to 4), 98(12 to 5), 110(8 to 1), 119(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(71: 60.000000), (80: 25.000000), (81: 45.000000), (97: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(71: 8), (80: 5), (81: 2), (82: 3), (97: 6), (98: 1), (110: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
