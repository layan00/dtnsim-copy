The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
79(1 to 11), 89(3 to 10), 90(4 to 6), 91(7 to 9), 111(12 to 4), 112(12 to 5), 121(8 to 1), 139(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(79: 60.000000), (89: 25.000000), (90: 25.000000), (91: 25.000000), (111: 25.000000), (139: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(79: 8), (89: 7), (90: 4), (91: 8), (111: 4), (139: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
