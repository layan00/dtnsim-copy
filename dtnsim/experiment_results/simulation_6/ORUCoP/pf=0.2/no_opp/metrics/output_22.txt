The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
379(1 to 11), 388(3 to 10), 389(4 to 6), 390(7 to 9), 408(12 to 4), 409(12 to 5), 423(8 to 1), 440(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(388: 25.000000), (389: 25.000000), (408: 25.000000), (440: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(379: 5), (388: 7), (389: 4), (390: 8), (408: 6), (409: 1), (440: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
