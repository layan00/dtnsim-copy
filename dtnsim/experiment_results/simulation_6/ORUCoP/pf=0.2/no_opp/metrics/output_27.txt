The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
381(1 to 11), 390(3 to 10), 391(4 to 6), 392(7 to 9), 407(12 to 4), 408(12 to 5), 423(8 to 1), 442(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(381: 60.000000), (390: 35.000000), (391: 25.000000), (407: 25.000000), (423: 15.000000), (442: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(381: 4), (390: 5), (391: 4), (392: 7), (407: 7), (408: 2), (423: 4), (442: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
