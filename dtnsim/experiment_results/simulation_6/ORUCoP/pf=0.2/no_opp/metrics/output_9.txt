The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
725(1 to 11), 734(3 to 10), 735(4 to 6), 736(7 to 9), 754(12 to 4), 755(12 to 5), 765(8 to 1), 782(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(734: 25.000000), (736: 25.000000), (755: 15.000000), (782: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(725: 6), (734: 6), (736: 5), (754: 8), (755: 4), (782: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
