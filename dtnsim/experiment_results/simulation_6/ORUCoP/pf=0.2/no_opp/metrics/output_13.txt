The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
487(1 to 11), 496(3 to 10), 497(4 to 6), 498(7 to 9), 519(12 to 4), 520(12 to 5), 534(8 to 1), 557(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 35.000000), (497: 25.000000), (498: 25.000000), (519: 25.000000), (520: 15.000000), (534: 15.000000), (557: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(487: 4), (496: 7), (497: 4), (498: 9), (519: 9), (520: 4), (534: 4), (557: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
