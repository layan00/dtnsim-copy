The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
509(1 to 11), 517(3 to 10), 518(4 to 6), 519(7 to 9), 530(12 to 4), 531(12 to 5), 538(8 to 1), 546(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(518: 45.000000), (519: 25.000000), (530: 85.000000), (546: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(509: 4), (517: 3), (518: 6), (519: 3), (530: 2), (531: 4), (538: 2), (546: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
