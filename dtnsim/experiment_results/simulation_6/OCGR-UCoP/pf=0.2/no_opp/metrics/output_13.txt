The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
473(1 to 11), 482(3 to 10), 483(4 to 6), 484(7 to 9), 498(12 to 4), 499(12 to 5), 506(8 to 1), 521(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(483: 35.000000), (484: 25.000000), (499: 15.000000), (506: 15.000000), (521: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(473: 4), (482: 5), (483: 6), (484: 3), (498: 2), (499: 4), (506: 4), (521: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
