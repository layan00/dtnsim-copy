The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
629(1 to 11), 639(3 to 10), 640(4 to 6), 641(7 to 9), 655(12 to 4), 656(12 to 5), 663(8 to 1), 679(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(629: 60.000000), (639: 25.000000), (640: 35.000000), (641: 25.000000), (656: 15.000000), (663: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(629: 4), (639: 5), (640: 6), (641: 3), (655: 2), (656: 4), (663: 4), (679: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
