The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
380(1 to 11), 385(3 to 10), 386(4 to 6), 387(7 to 9), 400(12 to 4), 401(12 to 5), 408(8 to 1), 420(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(380: 60.000000), (385: 35.000000), (420: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(380: 5), (385: 4), (386: 4), (387: 3), (400: 1), (401: 3), (408: 4), (420: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
