The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(1 to 11), 90(3 to 10), 91(4 to 6), 92(7 to 9), 103(12 to 4), 104(12 to 5), 110(8 to 1), 117(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 60.000000), (90: 25.000000), (103: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 4), (90: 5), (91: 3), (92: 2), (103: 2), (104: 2), (110: 2), (117: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
