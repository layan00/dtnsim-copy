The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
365(1 to 11), 373(3 to 10), 374(4 to 6), 375(7 to 9), 388(12 to 4), 389(12 to 5), 394(8 to 1), 404(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(373: 25.000000), (404: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(365: 5), (373: 5), (374: 3), (375: 2), (388: 1), (389: 2), (394: 1), (404: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
