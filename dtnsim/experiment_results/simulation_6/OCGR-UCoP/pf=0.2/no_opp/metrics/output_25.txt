The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(1 to 11), 88(3 to 10), 89(4 to 6), 90(7 to 9), 103(12 to 4), 104(12 to 5), 111(8 to 1), 123(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 60.000000), (88: 25.000000), (90: 25.000000), (104: 15.000000), (123: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 5), (88: 5), (89: 2), (90: 3), (103: 1), (104: 4), (111: 2), (123: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
