The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
668(1 to 11), 676(3 to 10), 677(4 to 6), 678(7 to 9), 690(12 to 4), 691(12 to 5), 695(8 to 1), 706(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(676: 25.000000), (678: 25.000000), (691: 15.000000), (706: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(668: 5), (676: 5), (677: 2), (678: 3), (690: 1), (691: 4), (695: 1), (706: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
