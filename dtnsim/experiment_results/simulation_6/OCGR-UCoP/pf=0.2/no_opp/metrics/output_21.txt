The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 11), 232(3 to 10), 233(4 to 6), 234(7 to 9), 248(12 to 4), 249(12 to 5), 254(8 to 1), 267(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(232: 25.000000), (233: 35.000000), (234: 25.000000), (248: 85.000000), (249: 15.000000), (267: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 3), (232: 5), (233: 6), (234: 3), (248: 2), (249: 4), (254: 2), (267: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
