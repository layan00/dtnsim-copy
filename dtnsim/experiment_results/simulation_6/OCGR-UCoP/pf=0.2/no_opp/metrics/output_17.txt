The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
347(1 to 11), 353(3 to 10), 354(4 to 6), 355(7 to 9), 368(12 to 4), 369(12 to 5), 375(8 to 1), 388(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(353: 35.000000), (354: 35.000000), (355: 25.000000), (368: 85.000000), (369: 15.000000), (388: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(347: 4), (353: 4), (354: 6), (355: 3), (368: 2), (369: 4), (375: 3), (388: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
