The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(1 to 11), 659(3 to 10), 660(4 to 6), 661(7 to 9), 668(12 to 4), 669(12 to 5), 675(8 to 1), 688(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(654: 60.000000), (659: 35.000000), (660: 45.000000), (661: 45.000000), (668: 85.000000), (675: 15.000000), (688: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 5), (659: 4), (660: 3), (661: 3), (668: 2), (669: 2), (675: 4), (688: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
