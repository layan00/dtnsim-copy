The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
379(1 to 11), 387(3 to 10), 388(4 to 6), 389(7 to 9), 399(12 to 4), 400(12 to 5), 405(8 to 1), 415(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(379: 60.000000), (387: 25.000000), (388: 45.000000), (389: 45.000000), (399: 85.000000), (405: 15.000000), (415: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(379: 4), (387: 5), (388: 3), (389: 3), (399: 2), (400: 3), (405: 4), (415: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
