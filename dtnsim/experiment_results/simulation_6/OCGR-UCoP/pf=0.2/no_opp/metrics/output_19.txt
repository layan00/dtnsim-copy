The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
634(1 to 11), 641(3 to 10), 642(4 to 6), 643(7 to 9), 659(12 to 4), 660(12 to 5), 665(8 to 1), 683(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(634: 60.000000), (641: 25.000000), (642: 55.000000), (643: 25.000000), (660: 15.000000), (665: 15.000000), (683: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(634: 5), (641: 5), (642: 7), (643: 3), (659: 1), (660: 4), (665: 4), (683: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
