The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
85(1 to 11), 95(3 to 10), 96(4 to 6), 97(7 to 9), 110(12 to 4), 111(12 to 5), 115(8 to 1), 127(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(85: 60.000000), (95: 25.000000), (97: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(85: 4), (95: 5), (96: 7), (97: 3), (110: 1), (111: 1), (115: 1), (127: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
