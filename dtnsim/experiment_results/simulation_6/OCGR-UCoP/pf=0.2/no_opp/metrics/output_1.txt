The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
238(1 to 11), 246(3 to 10), 247(4 to 6), 248(7 to 9), 264(12 to 4), 265(12 to 5), 271(8 to 1), 278(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 60.000000), (246: 25.000000), (264: 85.000000), (278: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(238: 5), (246: 5), (247: 4), (248: 3), (264: 2), (265: 3), (271: 1), (278: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
