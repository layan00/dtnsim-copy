The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 11), 220(3 to 10), 221(4 to 6), 222(7 to 9), 232(12 to 4), 233(12 to 5), 239(8 to 1), 244(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 35.000000), (232: 85.000000), (244: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 4), (220: 4), (221: 2), (222: 3), (232: 2), (233: 3), (239: 2), (244: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
