The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
85(1 to 11), 93(3 to 10), 94(4 to 6), 95(7 to 9), 111(12 to 4), 112(12 to 5), 119(8 to 1), 137(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(85: 60.000000), (93: 25.000000), (94: 55.000000), (95: 25.000000), (112: 15.000000), (119: 15.000000), (137: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(85: 5), (93: 5), (94: 7), (95: 3), (111: 1), (112: 4), (119: 4), (137: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 70 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
