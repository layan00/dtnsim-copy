The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
649(1 to 11), 657(3 to 10), 658(4 to 6), 659(7 to 9), 668(12 to 4), 669(12 to 5), 675(8 to 1), 685(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(649: 60.000000), (668: 85.000000), (685: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(649: 5), (657: 3), (658: 3), (659: 2), (668: 2), (669: 2), (675: 3), (685: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
