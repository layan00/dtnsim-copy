The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
491(1 to 11), 497(3 to 10), 498(4 to 6), 499(7 to 9), 511(12 to 4), 512(12 to 5), 517(8 to 1), 531(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(491: 60.000000), (498: 35.000000), (499: 25.000000), (511: 85.000000), (517: 15.000000), (531: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(491: 5), (497: 3), (498: 6), (499: 3), (511: 2), (512: 1), (517: 4), (531: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
