The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(1 to 11), 92(3 to 10), 93(4 to 6), 94(7 to 9), 100(12 to 4), 101(12 to 5), 106(8 to 1), 119(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(94: 25.000000), (100: 85.000000), (106: 15.000000), (119: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 4), (92: 3), (93: 4), (94: 3), (100: 2), (101: 1), (106: 4), (119: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
