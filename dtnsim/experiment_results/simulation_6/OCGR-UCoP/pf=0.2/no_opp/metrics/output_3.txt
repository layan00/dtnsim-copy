The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
520(1 to 11), 527(3 to 10), 528(4 to 6), 529(7 to 9), 537(12 to 4), 538(12 to 5), 543(8 to 1), 552(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 35.000000), (537: 85.000000), (552: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(520: 4), (527: 4), (528: 3), (529: 2), (537: 2), (538: 2), (543: 2), (552: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
