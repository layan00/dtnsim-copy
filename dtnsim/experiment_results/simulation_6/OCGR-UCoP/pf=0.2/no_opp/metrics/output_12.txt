The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
341(1 to 11), 347(3 to 10), 348(4 to 6), 349(7 to 9), 355(12 to 4), 356(12 to 5), 359(8 to 1), 365(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(348: 45.000000), (349: 45.000000), (365: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(341: 3), (347: 3), (348: 3), (349: 3), (355: 1), (356: 1), (359: 1), (365: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
