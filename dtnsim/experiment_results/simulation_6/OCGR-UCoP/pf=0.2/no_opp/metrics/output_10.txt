The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 11), 87(3 to 10), 88(4 to 6), 89(7 to 9), 100(12 to 4), 101(12 to 5), 105(8 to 1), 118(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(88: 35.000000), (89: 25.000000), (100: 85.000000), (118: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 4), (87: 3), (88: 6), (89: 3), (100: 2), (101: 1), (105: 4), (118: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
