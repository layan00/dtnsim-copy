The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 11), 221(3 to 10), 222(4 to 6), 223(7 to 9), 227(12 to 4), 228(12 to 5), 234(8 to 1), 244(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 60.000000), (222: 45.000000), (223: 45.000000), (234: 15.000000), (244: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 4), (221: 3), (222: 3), (223: 3), (227: 2), (228: 2), (234: 4), (244: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
