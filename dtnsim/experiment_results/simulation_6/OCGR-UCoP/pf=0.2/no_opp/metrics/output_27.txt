The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
364(1 to 11), 372(3 to 10), 373(4 to 6), 374(7 to 9), 385(12 to 4), 386(12 to 5), 394(8 to 1), 405(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(364: 60.000000), (385: 85.000000), (394: 15.000000), (405: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(364: 6), (372: 3), (373: 4), (374: 3), (385: 2), (386: 3), (394: 4), (405: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
