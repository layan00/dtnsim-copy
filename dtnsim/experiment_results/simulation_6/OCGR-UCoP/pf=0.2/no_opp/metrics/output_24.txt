The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(1 to 11), 663(3 to 10), 664(4 to 6), 665(7 to 9), 672(12 to 4), 673(12 to 5), 679(8 to 1), 692(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(654: 60.000000), (663: 35.000000), (672: 85.000000), (679: 15.000000), (692: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 4), (663: 4), (664: 3), (665: 2), (672: 2), (673: 2), (679: 4), (692: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
