The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(1 to 11), 236(3 to 10), 237(4 to 6), 238(7 to 9), 252(12 to 4), 253(12 to 5), 259(8 to 1), 272(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 60.000000), (236: 25.000000), (237: 35.000000), (238: 25.000000), (252: 85.000000), (253: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 4), (236: 5), (237: 6), (238: 3), (252: 2), (253: 4), (259: 1), (272: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
