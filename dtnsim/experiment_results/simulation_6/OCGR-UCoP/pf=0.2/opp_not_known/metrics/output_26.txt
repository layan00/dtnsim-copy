The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
668(1 to 11), 689(3 to 10), 690(4 to 6), 691(7 to 9), 699(12 to 4), 700(12 to 5), 729(8 to 1), 744(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(689: 35.000000), (690: 25.000000), (691: 25.000000), (729: 15.000000), (744: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(668: 3), (689: 6), (690: 4), (691: 3), (699: 2), (700: 2), (729: 4), (744: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 94 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
