The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 11), 244(3 to 10), 245(4 to 6), 246(7 to 9), 256(12 to 4), 257(12 to 5), 287(8 to 1), 300(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 60.000000), (244: 15.000000), (245: 35.000000), (246: 25.000000), (256: 85.000000), (257: 85.000000), (300: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 3), (244: 5), (245: 6), (246: 3), (256: 2), (257: 5), (287: 4), (300: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 74 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
