The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(1 to 11), 246(3 to 10), 247(4 to 6), 248(7 to 9), 259(12 to 4), 260(12 to 5), 291(8 to 1), 302(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 60.000000), (246: 25.000000), (247: 55.000000), (248: 25.000000), (260: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 3), (246: 5), (247: 5), (248: 3), (259: 1), (260: 4), (291: 2), (302: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 120 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
