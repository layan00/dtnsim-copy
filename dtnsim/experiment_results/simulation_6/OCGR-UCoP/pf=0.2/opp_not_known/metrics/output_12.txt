The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1097(1 to 11), 1117(3 to 10), 1118(4 to 6), 1119(7 to 9), 1125(12 to 4), 1126(12 to 5), 1155(8 to 1), 1161(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1097: 60.000000), (1117: 15.000000), (1118: 45.000000), (1119: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1097: 3), (1117: 5), (1118: 3), (1119: 3), (1125: 1), (1126: 2), (1155: 1), (1161: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 120 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
