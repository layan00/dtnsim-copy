The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1563(1 to 11), 1582(3 to 10), 1583(4 to 6), 1584(7 to 9), 1592(12 to 4), 1593(12 to 5), 1622(8 to 1), 1631(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1582: 35.000000), (1592: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1563: 3), (1582: 4), (1583: 3), (1584: 2), (1592: 2), (1593: 2), (1622: 2), (1631: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 127 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
