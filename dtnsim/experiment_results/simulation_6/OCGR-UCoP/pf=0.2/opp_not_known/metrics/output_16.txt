The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
657(1 to 11), 676(3 to 10), 677(4 to 6), 678(7 to 9), 682(12 to 4), 683(12 to 5), 713(8 to 1), 723(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(657: 60.000000), (676: 55.000000), (677: 45.000000), (678: 45.000000), (713: 15.000000), (723: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(657: 3), (676: 6), (677: 3), (678: 3), (682: 2), (683: 2), (713: 4), (723: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 65 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
