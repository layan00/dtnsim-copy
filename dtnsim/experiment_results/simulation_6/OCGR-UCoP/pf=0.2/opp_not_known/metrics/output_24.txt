The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1999(1 to 11), 2020(3 to 10), 2021(4 to 6), 2022(7 to 9), 2029(12 to 4), 2030(12 to 5), 2060(8 to 1), 2073(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1999: 60.000000), (2020: 35.000000), (2029: 85.000000), (2060: 15.000000), (2073: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1999: 3), (2020: 4), (2021: 3), (2022: 2), (2029: 2), (2030: 2), (2060: 4), (2073: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 63 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
