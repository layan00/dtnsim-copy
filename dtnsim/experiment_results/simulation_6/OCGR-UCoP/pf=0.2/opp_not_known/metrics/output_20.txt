The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
229(1 to 11), 251(3 to 10), 252(4 to 6), 253(7 to 9), 266(12 to 4), 267(12 to 5), 295(8 to 1), 307(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 60.000000), (251: 25.000000), (253: 25.000000), (307: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(229: 3), (251: 5), (252: 7), (253: 3), (266: 1), (267: 2), (295: 1), (307: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 120 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
