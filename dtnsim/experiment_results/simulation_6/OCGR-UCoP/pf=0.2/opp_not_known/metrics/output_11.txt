The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
667(1 to 11), 686(3 to 10), 687(4 to 6), 688(7 to 9), 696(12 to 4), 697(12 to 5), 727(8 to 1), 732(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(667: 60.000000), (686: 35.000000), (687: 55.000000), (696: 85.000000), (732: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(667: 3), (686: 4), (687: 5), (688: 3), (696: 2), (697: 3), (727: 2), (732: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 124 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
