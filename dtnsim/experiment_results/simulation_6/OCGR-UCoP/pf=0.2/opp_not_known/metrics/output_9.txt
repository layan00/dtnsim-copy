The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2016(1 to 11), 2037(3 to 10), 2038(4 to 6), 2039(7 to 9), 2050(12 to 4), 2051(12 to 5), 2079(8 to 1), 2089(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2037: 25.000000), (2039: 25.000000), (2051: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2016: 3), (2037: 5), (2038: 5), (2039: 3), (2050: 1), (2051: 4), (2079: 1), (2089: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 125 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
