The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2000(1 to 11), 2021(3 to 10), 2022(4 to 6), 2023(7 to 9), 2031(12 to 4), 2032(12 to 5), 2064(8 to 1), 2073(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2000: 60.000000), (2021: 15.000000), (2031: 85.000000), (2073: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2000: 3), (2021: 5), (2022: 3), (2023: 2), (2031: 2), (2032: 2), (2064: 3), (2073: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
