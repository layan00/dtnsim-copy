The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1996(1 to 11), 2015(3 to 10), 2016(4 to 6), 2017(7 to 9), 2022(12 to 4), 2023(12 to 5), 2053(8 to 1), 2065(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1996: 60.000000), (2015: 35.000000), (2016: 45.000000), (2017: 45.000000), (2022: 85.000000), (2053: 15.000000), (2065: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1996: 3), (2015: 4), (2016: 3), (2017: 3), (2022: 2), (2023: 2), (2053: 4), (2065: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 48 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
