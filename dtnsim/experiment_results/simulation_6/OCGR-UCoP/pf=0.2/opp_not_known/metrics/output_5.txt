The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(1 to 11), 248(3 to 10), 249(4 to 6), 250(7 to 9), 256(12 to 4), 257(12 to 5), 286(8 to 1), 299(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 55.000000), (250: 25.000000), (256: 85.000000), (286: 15.000000), (299: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 3), (248: 6), (249: 4), (250: 3), (256: 2), (257: 2), (286: 4), (299: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 93 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
