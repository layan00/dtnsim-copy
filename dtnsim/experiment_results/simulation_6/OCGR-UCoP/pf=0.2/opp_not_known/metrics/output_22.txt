The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1111(1 to 11), 1133(3 to 10), 1134(4 to 6), 1135(7 to 9), 1146(12 to 4), 1147(12 to 5), 1176(8 to 1), 1185(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1133: 25.000000), (1185: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1111: 3), (1133: 5), (1134: 3), (1135: 2), (1146: 1), (1147: 2), (1176: 1), (1185: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
