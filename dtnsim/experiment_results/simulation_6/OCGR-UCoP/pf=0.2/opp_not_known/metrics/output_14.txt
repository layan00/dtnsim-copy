The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1990(1 to 11), 2012(3 to 10), 2013(4 to 6), 2014(7 to 9), 2028(12 to 4), 2029(12 to 5), 2060(8 to 1), 2076(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1990: 60.000000), (2012: 25.000000), (2013: 35.000000), (2014: 25.000000), (2029: 15.000000), (2060: 15.000000), (2076: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1990: 3), (2012: 5), (2013: 6), (2014: 3), (2028: 2), (2029: 4), (2060: 4), (2076: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 51 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
