The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1577(1 to 11), 1598(3 to 10), 1599(4 to 6), 1600(7 to 9), 1607(12 to 4), 1608(12 to 5), 1638(8 to 1), 1650(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1577: 60.000000), (1598: 35.000000), (1607: 85.000000), (1638: 15.000000), (1650: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1577: 3), (1598: 4), (1599: 3), (1600: 2), (1607: 2), (1608: 2), (1638: 4), (1650: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 62 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
