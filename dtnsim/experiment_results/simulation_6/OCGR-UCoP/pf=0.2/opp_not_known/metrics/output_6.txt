The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
675(1 to 11), 696(3 to 10), 697(4 to 6), 698(7 to 9), 712(12 to 4), 713(12 to 5), 743(8 to 1), 756(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(675: 60.000000), (696: 25.000000), (697: 35.000000), (698: 25.000000), (712: 85.000000), (713: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(675: 3), (696: 5), (697: 6), (698: 3), (712: 2), (713: 4), (743: 1), (756: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
