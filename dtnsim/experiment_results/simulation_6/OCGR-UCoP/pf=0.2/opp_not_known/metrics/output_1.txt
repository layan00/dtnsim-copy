The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
682(1 to 11), 704(3 to 10), 705(4 to 6), 706(7 to 9), 720(12 to 4), 721(12 to 5), 751(8 to 1), 757(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(682: 60.000000), (704: 25.000000), (720: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(682: 3), (704: 5), (705: 4), (706: 3), (720: 2), (721: 3), (751: 1), (757: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 142 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
