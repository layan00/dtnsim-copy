The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1986(1 to 11), 2007(3 to 10), 2008(4 to 6), 2009(7 to 9), 2023(12 to 4), 2024(12 to 5), 2053(8 to 1), 2070(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1986: 60.000000), (2007: 25.000000), (2008: 55.000000), (2009: 25.000000), (2024: 15.000000), (2053: 15.000000), (2070: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1986: 3), (2007: 5), (2008: 7), (2009: 3), (2023: 1), (2024: 4), (2053: 4), (2070: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 76 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
