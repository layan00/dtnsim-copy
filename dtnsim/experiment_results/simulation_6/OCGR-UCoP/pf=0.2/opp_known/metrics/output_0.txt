The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 11), 227(3 to 10), 228(4 to 6), 229(7 to 9), 238(12 to 4), 239(12 to 5), 270(8 to 1), 282(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(217: 60.000000), (227: 15.000000), (228: 55.000000), (229: 25.000000), (282: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 3), (227: 4), (228: 4), (229: 3), (238: 6), (239: 6), (270: 3), (282: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 66 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
