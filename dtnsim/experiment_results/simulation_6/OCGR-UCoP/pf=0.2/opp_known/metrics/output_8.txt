The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1215(1 to 11), 1224(3 to 10), 1225(4 to 6), 1226(7 to 9), 1231(12 to 4), 1232(12 to 5), 1255(8 to 1), 1267(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1215: 60.000000), (1224: 35.000000), (1225: 35.000000), (1231: 85.000000), (1232: 85.000000), (1267: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1215: 3), (1224: 4), (1225: 3), (1226: 2), (1231: 9), (1232: 11), (1255: 3), (1267: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
