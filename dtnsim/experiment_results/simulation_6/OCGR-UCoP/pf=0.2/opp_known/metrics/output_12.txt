The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
848(1 to 11), 856(3 to 10), 857(4 to 6), 858(7 to 9), 863(12 to 4), 864(12 to 5), 883(8 to 1), 889(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(848: 60.000000), (856: 15.000000), (857: 35.000000), (858: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(848: 3), (856: 4), (857: 3), (858: 3), (863: 2), (864: 2), (883: 1), (889: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
