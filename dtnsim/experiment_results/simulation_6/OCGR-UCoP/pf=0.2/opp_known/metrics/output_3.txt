The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1213(1 to 11), 1220(3 to 10), 1221(4 to 6), 1222(7 to 9), 1228(12 to 4), 1229(12 to 5), 1249(8 to 1), 1260(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1220: 35.000000), (1221: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1213: 3), (1220: 4), (1221: 4), (1222: 2), (1228: 3), (1229: 3), (1249: 3), (1260: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
