The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
534(1 to 11), 541(3 to 10), 542(4 to 6), 543(7 to 9), 546(12 to 4), 547(12 to 5), 570(8 to 1), 580(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(534: 60.000000), (541: 55.000000), (542: 35.000000), (543: 45.000000), (580: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(534: 3), (541: 6), (542: 3), (543: 3), (546: 5), (547: 5), (570: 3), (580: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
