The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1204(1 to 11), 1212(3 to 10), 1213(4 to 6), 1214(7 to 9), 1222(12 to 4), 1223(12 to 5), 1252(8 to 1), 1260(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1212: 55.000000), (1213: 35.000000), (1214: 25.000000), (1222: 85.000000), (1223: 85.000000), (1260: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1204: 3), (1212: 6), (1213: 3), (1214: 3), (1222: 8), (1223: 6), (1252: 3), (1260: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
