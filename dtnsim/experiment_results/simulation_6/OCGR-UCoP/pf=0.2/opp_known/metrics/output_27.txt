The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
868(1 to 11), 878(3 to 10), 879(4 to 6), 880(7 to 9), 888(12 to 4), 889(12 to 5), 920(8 to 1), 930(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(868: 60.000000), (878: 15.000000), (879: 35.000000), (888: 85.000000), (889: 85.000000), (930: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(868: 3), (878: 4), (879: 3), (880: 3), (888: 8), (889: 6), (920: 3), (930: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
