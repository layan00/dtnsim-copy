The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
547(1 to 11), 556(3 to 10), 557(4 to 6), 558(7 to 9), 565(12 to 4), 566(12 to 5), 587(8 to 1), 599(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(556: 15.000000), (557: 35.000000), (558: 25.000000), (599: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(547: 3), (556: 4), (557: 3), (558: 3), (565: 3), (566: 3), (587: 3), (599: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
