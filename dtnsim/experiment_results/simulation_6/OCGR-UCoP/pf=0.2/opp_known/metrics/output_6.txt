The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
546(1 to 11), 555(3 to 10), 556(4 to 6), 557(7 to 9), 566(12 to 4), 567(12 to 5), 597(8 to 1), 605(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(546: 60.000000), (555: 15.000000), (556: 35.000000), (557: 25.000000), (566: 85.000000), (567: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(546: 3), (555: 4), (556: 3), (557: 3), (566: 8), (567: 6), (597: 1), (605: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
