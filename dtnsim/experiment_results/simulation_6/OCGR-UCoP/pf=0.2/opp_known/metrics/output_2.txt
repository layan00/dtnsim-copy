The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
881(1 to 11), 888(3 to 10), 889(4 to 6), 890(7 to 9), 898(12 to 4), 899(12 to 5), 928(8 to 1), 939(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(881: 60.000000), (888: 35.000000), (889: 35.000000), (898: 85.000000), (899: 85.000000), (939: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(881: 3), (888: 4), (889: 3), (890: 3), (898: 8), (899: 6), (928: 3), (939: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
