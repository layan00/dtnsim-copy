The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
551(1 to 11), 561(3 to 10), 562(4 to 6), 563(7 to 9), 572(12 to 4), 573(12 to 5), 603(8 to 1), 608(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(551: 60.000000), (561: 15.000000), (562: 35.000000), (572: 85.000000), (573: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(551: 3), (561: 4), (562: 3), (563: 3), (572: 8), (573: 6), (603: 1), (608: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
