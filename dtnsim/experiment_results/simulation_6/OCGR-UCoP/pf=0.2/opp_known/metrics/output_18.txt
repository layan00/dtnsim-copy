The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1186(1 to 11), 1194(3 to 10), 1195(4 to 6), 1196(7 to 9), 1203(12 to 4), 1204(12 to 5), 1223(8 to 1), 1234(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1186: 60.000000), (1194: 55.000000), (1195: 35.000000), (1196: 25.000000), (1203: 85.000000), (1204: 85.000000), (1234: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1186: 3), (1194: 6), (1195: 3), (1196: 3), (1203: 3), (1204: 5), (1223: 3), (1234: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
