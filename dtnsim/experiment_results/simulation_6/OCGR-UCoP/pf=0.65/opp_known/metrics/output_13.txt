The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1043(1 to 11), 1050(3 to 10), 1051(4 to 6), 1052(7 to 9), 1059(12 to 4), 1060(12 to 5), 1077(8 to 1), 1085(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1050: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1043: 3), (1050: 4), (1051: 2), (1052: 3), (1059: 2), (1060: 2), (1077: 4), (1085: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
