The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
767(1 to 11), 776(3 to 10), 777(4 to 6), 778(7 to 9), 783(12 to 4), 784(12 to 5), 802(8 to 1), 806(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(776: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(767: 3), (776: 4), (777: 2), (778: 2), (783: 1), (784: 1), (802: 1), (806: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
