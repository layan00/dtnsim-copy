The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1284(1 to 11), 1290(3 to 10), 1291(4 to 6), 1292(7 to 9), 1293(12 to 4), 1294(12 to 5), 1311(8 to 1), 1322(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1284: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1284: 3), (1290: 4), (1291: 2), (1292: 2), (1293: 2), (1294: 2), (1311: 4), (1322: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
