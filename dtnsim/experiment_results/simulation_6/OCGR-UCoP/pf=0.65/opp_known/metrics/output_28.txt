The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1023(1 to 11), 1028(3 to 10), 1029(4 to 6), 1030(7 to 9), 1036(12 to 4), 1037(12 to 5), 1054(8 to 1), 1059(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1023: 3), (1028: 2), (1029: 2), (1030: 3), (1036: 2), (1037: 2), (1054: 4), (1059: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
