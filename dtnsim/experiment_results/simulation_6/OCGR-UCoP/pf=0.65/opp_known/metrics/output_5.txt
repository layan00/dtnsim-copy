The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(1 to 11), 199(3 to 10), 200(4 to 6), 201(7 to 9), 204(12 to 4), 205(12 to 5), 221(8 to 1), 223(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(199: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 3), (199: 6), (200: 2), (201: 2), (204: 1), (205: 1), (221: 1), (223: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 194: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 199: (to: 13, time: 80.000000),

Node 3: 
Bundle 199: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), 
Node 4:
