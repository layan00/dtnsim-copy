The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
476(1 to 11), 482(3 to 10), 483(4 to 6), 484(7 to 9), 487(12 to 4), 488(12 to 5), 506(8 to 1), 510(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(482: 15.000000), (487: 85.000000), (488: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(476: 3), (482: 4), (483: 2), (484: 2), (487: 2), (488: 4), (506: 1), (510: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
