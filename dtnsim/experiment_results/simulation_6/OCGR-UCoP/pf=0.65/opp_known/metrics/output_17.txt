The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
737(1 to 11), 743(3 to 10), 744(4 to 6), 745(7 to 9), 748(12 to 4), 749(12 to 5), 765(8 to 1), 772(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(737: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(737: 3), (743: 4), (744: 2), (745: 2), (748: 1), (749: 1), (765: 4), (772: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
