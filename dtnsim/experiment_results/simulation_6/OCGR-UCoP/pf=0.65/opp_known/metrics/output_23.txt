The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1048(1 to 11), 1054(3 to 10), 1055(4 to 6), 1056(7 to 9), 1058(12 to 4), 1059(12 to 5), 1074(8 to 1), 1079(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1054: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1048: 3), (1054: 6), (1055: 2), (1056: 2), (1058: 1), (1059: 1), (1074: 1), (1079: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
