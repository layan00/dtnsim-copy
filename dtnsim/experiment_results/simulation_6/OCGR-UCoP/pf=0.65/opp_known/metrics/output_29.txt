The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1302(1 to 11), 1308(3 to 10), 1309(4 to 6), 1310(7 to 9), 1314(12 to 4), 1315(12 to 5), 1333(8 to 1), 1338(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1338: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1302: 3), (1308: 2), (1309: 2), (1310: 2), (1314: 2), (1315: 2), (1333: 1), (1338: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
