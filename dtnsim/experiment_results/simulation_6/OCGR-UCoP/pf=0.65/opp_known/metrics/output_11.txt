The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
479(1 to 11), 484(3 to 10), 485(4 to 6), 486(7 to 9), 492(12 to 4), 493(12 to 5), 510(8 to 1), 513(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(479: 60.000000), (486: 45.000000), (492: 85.000000), (493: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(479: 3), (484: 4), (485: 2), (486: 3), (492: 2), (493: 4), (510: 1), (513: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
