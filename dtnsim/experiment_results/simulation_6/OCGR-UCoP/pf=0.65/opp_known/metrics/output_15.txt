The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 11), 204(3 to 10), 205(4 to 6), 206(7 to 9), 208(12 to 4), 209(12 to 5), 227(8 to 1), 229(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(198: 60.000000), (208: 85.000000), (209: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 3), (204: 2), (205: 2), (206: 2), (208: 2), (209: 4), (227: 1), (229: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
