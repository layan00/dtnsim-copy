The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1013(1 to 11), 1017(3 to 10), 1018(4 to 6), 1019(7 to 9), 1022(12 to 4), 1023(12 to 5), 1040(8 to 1), 1044(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1017: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1013: 3), (1017: 6), (1018: 2), (1019: 2), (1022: 1), (1023: 1), (1040: 4), (1044: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
