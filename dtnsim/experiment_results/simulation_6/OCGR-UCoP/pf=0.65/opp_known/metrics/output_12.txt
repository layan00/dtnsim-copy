The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
764(1 to 11), 770(3 to 10), 771(4 to 6), 772(7 to 9), 776(12 to 4), 777(12 to 5), 792(8 to 1), 795(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(770: 35.000000), (795: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(764: 3), (770: 4), (771: 2), (772: 2), (776: 1), (777: 1), (792: 1), (795: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
