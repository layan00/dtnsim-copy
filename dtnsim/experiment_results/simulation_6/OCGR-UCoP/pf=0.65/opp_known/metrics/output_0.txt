The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(1 to 11), 201(3 to 10), 202(4 to 6), 203(7 to 9), 209(12 to 4), 210(12 to 5), 225(8 to 1), 233(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(196: 60.000000), (203: 25.000000), (233: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 3), (201: 4), (202: 2), (203: 3), (209: 1), (210: 1), (225: 1), (233: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
