The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1326(1 to 11), 1331(3 to 10), 1332(4 to 6), 1333(7 to 9), 1337(12 to 4), 1338(12 to 5), 1356(8 to 1), 1360(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1326: 60.000000), (1331: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1326: 3), (1331: 4), (1332: 2), (1333: 3), (1337: 1), (1338: 1), (1356: 1), (1360: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
