The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
466(1 to 11), 471(3 to 10), 472(4 to 6), 473(7 to 9), 477(12 to 4), 478(12 to 5), 495(8 to 1), 500(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(466: 3), (471: 4), (472: 2), (473: 2), (477: 1), (478: 1), (495: 1), (500: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
