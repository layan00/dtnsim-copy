The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
488(1 to 11), 496(3 to 10), 497(4 to 6), 498(7 to 9), 502(12 to 4), 503(12 to 5), 521(8 to 1), 525(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(488: 3), (496: 4), (497: 2), (498: 2), (502: 1), (503: 1), (521: 1), (525: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
