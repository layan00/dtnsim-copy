The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1284(1 to 11), 1289(3 to 10), 1290(4 to 6), 1291(7 to 9), 1294(12 to 4), 1295(12 to 5), 1310(8 to 1), 1315(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1284: 3), (1289: 2), (1290: 2), (1291: 3), (1294: 1), (1295: 1), (1310: 1), (1315: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
