The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1322(1 to 11), 1327(3 to 10), 1328(4 to 6), 1329(7 to 9), 1331(12 to 4), 1332(12 to 5), 1348(8 to 1), 1354(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1327: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1322: 3), (1327: 4), (1328: 2), (1329: 2), (1331: 1), (1332: 1), (1348: 1), (1354: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
