The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 11), 202(3 to 10), 203(4 to 6), 204(7 to 9), 209(12 to 4), 210(12 to 5), 227(8 to 1), 231(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(198: 60.000000), (204: 25.000000), (231: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 3), (202: 2), (203: 2), (204: 3), (209: 1), (210: 1), (227: 1), (231: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 198: (to: 13, time: 0.000000),
