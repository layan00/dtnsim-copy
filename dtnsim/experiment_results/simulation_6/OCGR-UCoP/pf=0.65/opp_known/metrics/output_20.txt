The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
204(1 to 11), 212(3 to 10), 213(4 to 6), 214(7 to 9), 218(12 to 4), 219(12 to 5), 238(8 to 1), 244(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 15.000000), (244: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(204: 3), (212: 4), (213: 2), (214: 2), (218: 1), (219: 1), (238: 1), (244: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 204: (to: 13, time: 0.000000),
