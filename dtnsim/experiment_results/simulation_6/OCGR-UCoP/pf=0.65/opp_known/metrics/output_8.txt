The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1011(1 to 11), 1016(3 to 10), 1017(4 to 6), 1018(7 to 9), 1020(12 to 4), 1021(12 to 5), 1039(8 to 1), 1045(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1016: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1011: 3), (1016: 4), (1017: 2), (1018: 2), (1020: 1), (1021: 1), (1039: 1), (1045: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
