The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
749(1 to 11), 753(3 to 10), 754(4 to 6), 755(7 to 9), 759(12 to 4), 760(12 to 5), 776(8 to 1), 779(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(749: 3), (753: 4), (754: 2), (755: 2), (759: 1), (760: 1), (776: 1), (779: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
