The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
741(1 to 11), 747(3 to 10), 748(4 to 6), 749(7 to 9), 753(12 to 4), 754(12 to 5), 770(8 to 1), 777(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(741: 60.000000), (747: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(741: 3), (747: 4), (748: 2), (749: 2), (753: 1), (754: 1), (770: 1), (777: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
