The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
738(1 to 11), 741(3 to 10), 742(4 to 6), 743(7 to 9), 747(12 to 4), 748(12 to 5), 764(8 to 1), 771(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(738: 60.000000), (771: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(738: 3), (741: 2), (742: 2), (743: 2), (747: 1), (748: 1), (764: 4), (771: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
