The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
333(1 to 11), 337(3 to 10), 338(4 to 6), 339(7 to 9), 345(12 to 4), 346(12 to 5), 351(8 to 1), 354(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(333: 4), (337: 2), (338: 2), (339: 3), (345: 2), (346: 3), (351: 2), (354: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
