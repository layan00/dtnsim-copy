The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(1 to 11), 241(3 to 10), 242(4 to 6), 243(7 to 9), 247(12 to 4), 248(12 to 5), 251(8 to 1), 258(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 3), (241: 4), (242: 2), (243: 2), (247: 1), (248: 2), (251: 1), (258: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
