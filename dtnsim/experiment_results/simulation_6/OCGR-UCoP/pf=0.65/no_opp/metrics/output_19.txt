The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
411(1 to 11), 415(3 to 10), 416(4 to 6), 417(7 to 9), 424(12 to 4), 425(12 to 5), 426(8 to 1), 431(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(417: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(411: 3), (415: 2), (416: 6), (417: 3), (424: 1), (425: 1), (426: 1), (431: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
