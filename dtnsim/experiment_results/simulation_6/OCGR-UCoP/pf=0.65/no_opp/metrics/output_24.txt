The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
454(1 to 11), 457(3 to 10), 458(4 to 6), 459(7 to 9), 462(12 to 4), 463(12 to 5), 465(8 to 1), 471(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(457: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(454: 6), (457: 4), (458: 2), (459: 2), (462: 1), (463: 1), (465: 1), (471: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 454: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000),
