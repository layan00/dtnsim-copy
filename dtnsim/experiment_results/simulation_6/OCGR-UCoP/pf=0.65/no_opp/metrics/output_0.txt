The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
64(1 to 11), 67(3 to 10), 68(4 to 6), 69(7 to 9), 75(12 to 4), 76(12 to 5), 77(8 to 1), 86(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(69: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(64: 3), (67: 4), (68: 3), (69: 3), (75: 1), (76: 1), (77: 1), (86: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 56 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 64: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
