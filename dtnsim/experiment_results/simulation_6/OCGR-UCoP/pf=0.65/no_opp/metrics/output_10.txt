The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(1 to 11), 69(3 to 10), 70(4 to 6), 71(7 to 9), 77(12 to 4), 78(12 to 5), 81(8 to 1), 85(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(71: 25.000000), (85: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 4), (69: 2), (70: 2), (71: 3), (77: 1), (78: 1), (81: 1), (85: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 66: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 69: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000),

Node 6: 
Bundle 85: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 71: (to: 11, time: 20.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 81: (to: 4, time: 40.000000),
