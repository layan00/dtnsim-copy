The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
359(1 to 11), 364(3 to 10), 365(4 to 6), 366(7 to 9), 376(12 to 4), 377(12 to 5), 383(8 to 1), 392(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(364: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(359: 6), (364: 4), (365: 4), (366: 3), (376: 2), (377: 3), (383: 4), (392: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
