The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
62(1 to 11), 66(3 to 10), 67(4 to 6), 68(7 to 9), 72(12 to 4), 73(12 to 5), 75(8 to 1), 77(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(62: 4), (66: 3), (67: 2), (68: 2), (72: 1), (73: 1), (75: 1), (77: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 62: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 66: (to: 1, time: 25.000000), (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 66: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 67: (to: 7, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 5:
