The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
267(1 to 11), 274(3 to 10), 275(4 to 6), 276(7 to 9), 283(12 to 4), 284(12 to 5), 287(8 to 1), 291(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(291: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(267: 3), (274: 3), (275: 3), (276: 2), (283: 1), (284: 2), (287: 1), (291: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
