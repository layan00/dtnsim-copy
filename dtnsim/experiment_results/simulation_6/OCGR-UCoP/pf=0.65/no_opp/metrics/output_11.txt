The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
164(1 to 11), 167(3 to 10), 168(4 to 6), 169(7 to 9), 177(12 to 4), 178(12 to 5), 183(8 to 1), 186(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(169: 45.000000), (177: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(164: 4), (167: 4), (168: 2), (169: 3), (177: 2), (178: 3), (183: 1), (186: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 164: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000),
