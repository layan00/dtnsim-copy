The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(1 to 11), 179(3 to 10), 180(4 to 6), 181(7 to 9), 187(12 to 4), 188(12 to 5), 190(8 to 1), 194(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 3), (179: 3), (180: 3), (181: 2), (187: 1), (188: 1), (190: 1), (194: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
