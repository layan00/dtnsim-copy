The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
324(1 to 11), 328(3 to 10), 329(4 to 6), 330(7 to 9), 333(12 to 4), 334(12 to 5), 337(8 to 1), 339(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(324: 3), (328: 3), (329: 2), (330: 2), (333: 1), (334: 1), (337: 2), (339: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
