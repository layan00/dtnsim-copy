The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
72(1 to 11), 80(3 to 10), 81(4 to 6), 82(7 to 9), 86(12 to 4), 87(12 to 5), 90(8 to 1), 99(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(72: 4), (80: 3), (81: 4), (82: 2), (86: 1), (87: 1), (90: 1), (99: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 72: (to: 5, time: 0.000000),
