The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
465(1 to 11), 469(3 to 10), 470(4 to 6), 471(7 to 9), 476(12 to 4), 477(12 to 5), 479(8 to 1), 484(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(465: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(465: 5), (469: 3), (470: 2), (471: 3), (476: 1), (477: 1), (479: 1), (484: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
