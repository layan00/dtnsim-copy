The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(1 to 11), 72(3 to 10), 73(4 to 6), 74(7 to 9), 77(12 to 4), 78(12 to 5), 82(8 to 1), 84(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(77: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 3), (72: 2), (73: 3), (74: 2), (77: 2), (78: 1), (82: 1), (84: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
