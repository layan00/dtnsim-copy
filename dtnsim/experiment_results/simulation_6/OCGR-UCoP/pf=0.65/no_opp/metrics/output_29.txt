The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
428(1 to 11), 432(3 to 10), 433(4 to 6), 434(7 to 9), 438(12 to 4), 439(12 to 5), 445(8 to 1), 451(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(428: 4), (432: 2), (433: 3), (434: 2), (438: 2), (439: 2), (445: 1), (451: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
