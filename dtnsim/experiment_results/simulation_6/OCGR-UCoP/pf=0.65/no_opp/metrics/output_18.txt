The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
323(1 to 11), 327(3 to 10), 328(4 to 6), 329(7 to 9), 331(12 to 4), 332(12 to 5), 337(8 to 1), 344(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(323: 4), (327: 3), (328: 2), (329: 2), (331: 1), (332: 1), (337: 2), (344: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
