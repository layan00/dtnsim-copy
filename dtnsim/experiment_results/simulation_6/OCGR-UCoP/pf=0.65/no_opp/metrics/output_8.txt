The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
332(1 to 11), 335(3 to 10), 336(4 to 6), 337(7 to 9), 339(12 to 4), 340(12 to 5), 345(8 to 1), 352(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(335: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(332: 6), (335: 4), (336: 2), (337: 2), (339: 1), (340: 1), (345: 1), (352: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 332: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
