The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
422(1 to 11), 426(3 to 10), 427(4 to 6), 428(7 to 9), 432(12 to 4), 433(12 to 5), 434(8 to 1), 440(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(440: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(422: 5), (426: 2), (427: 2), (428: 3), (432: 1), (433: 1), (434: 1), (440: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
