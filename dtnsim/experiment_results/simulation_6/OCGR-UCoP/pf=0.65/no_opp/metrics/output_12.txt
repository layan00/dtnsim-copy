The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
264(1 to 11), 268(3 to 10), 269(4 to 6), 270(7 to 9), 274(12 to 4), 275(12 to 5), 276(8 to 1), 279(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(268: 35.000000), (279: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(264: 3), (268: 4), (269: 2), (270: 2), (274: 1), (275: 1), (276: 1), (279: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 264: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 268: (to: 1, time: 25.000000), (to: 6, time: 50.000000),
