The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
983(1 to 11), 1001(3 to 10), 1002(4 to 6), 1003(7 to 9), 1006(12 to 4), 1007(12 to 5), 1033(8 to 1), 1040(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(983: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(983: 3), (1001: 4), (1002: 3), (1003: 2), (1006: 1), (1007: 1), (1033: 3), (1040: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 107 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
