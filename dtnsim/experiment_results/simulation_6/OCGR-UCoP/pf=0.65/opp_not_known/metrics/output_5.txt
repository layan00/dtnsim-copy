The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 11), 223(3 to 10), 224(4 to 6), 225(7 to 9), 228(12 to 4), 229(12 to 5), 255(8 to 1), 257(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 3), (223: 6), (224: 5), (225: 1), (228: 1), (229: 2), (255: 1), (257: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 128 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
