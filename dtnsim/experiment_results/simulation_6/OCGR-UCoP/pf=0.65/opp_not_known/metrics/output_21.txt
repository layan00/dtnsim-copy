The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
621(1 to 11), 641(3 to 10), 642(4 to 6), 643(7 to 9), 649(12 to 4), 650(12 to 5), 678(8 to 1), 682(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(641: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(621: 3), (641: 5), (642: 3), (643: 2), (649: 1), (650: 1), (678: 1), (682: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 135 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
