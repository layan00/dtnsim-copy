The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1014(1 to 11), 1032(3 to 10), 1033(4 to 6), 1034(7 to 9), 1038(12 to 4), 1039(12 to 5), 1064(8 to 1), 1067(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1032: 35.000000), (1033: 55.000000), (1067: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1014: 3), (1032: 4), (1033: 5), (1034: 2), (1038: 1), (1039: 2), (1064: 1), (1067: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 117 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
