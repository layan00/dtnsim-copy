The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 11), 228(3 to 10), 229(4 to 6), 230(7 to 9), 233(12 to 4), 234(12 to 5), 262(8 to 1), 264(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 60.000000), (233: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 3), (228: 2), (229: 3), (230: 2), (233: 2), (234: 1), (262: 1), (264: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 67 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
