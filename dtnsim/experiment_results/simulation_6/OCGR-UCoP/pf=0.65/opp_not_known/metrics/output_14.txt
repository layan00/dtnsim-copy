The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1819(1 to 11), 1836(3 to 10), 1837(4 to 6), 1838(7 to 9), 1842(12 to 4), 1843(12 to 5), 1871(8 to 1), 1875(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1819: 60.000000), (1836: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1819: 3), (1836: 5), (1837: 5), (1838: 2), (1842: 1), (1843: 1), (1871: 1), (1875: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
