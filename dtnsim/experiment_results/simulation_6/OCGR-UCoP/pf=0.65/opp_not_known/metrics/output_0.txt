The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(1 to 11), 225(3 to 10), 226(4 to 6), 227(7 to 9), 233(12 to 4), 234(12 to 5), 259(8 to 1), 268(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(208: 60.000000), (227: 25.000000), (268: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 3), (225: 4), (226: 3), (227: 3), (233: 1), (234: 2), (259: 1), (268: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 129 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
