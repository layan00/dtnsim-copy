The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1020(1 to 11), 1041(3 to 10), 1042(4 to 6), 1043(7 to 9), 1050(12 to 4), 1051(12 to 5), 1080(8 to 1), 1084(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1041: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1020: 3), (1041: 5), (1042: 3), (1043: 2), (1050: 1), (1051: 2), (1080: 1), (1084: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 138 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
