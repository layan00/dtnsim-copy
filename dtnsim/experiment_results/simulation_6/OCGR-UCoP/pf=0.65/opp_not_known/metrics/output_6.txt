The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
598(1 to 11), 615(3 to 10), 616(4 to 6), 617(7 to 9), 622(12 to 4), 623(12 to 5), 650(8 to 1), 655(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(598: 3), (615: 3), (616: 3), (617: 2), (622: 1), (623: 2), (650: 1), (655: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 136 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
