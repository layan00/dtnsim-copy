The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1379(1 to 11), 1395(3 to 10), 1396(4 to 6), 1397(7 to 9), 1400(12 to 4), 1401(12 to 5), 1428(8 to 1), 1430(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1395: 55.000000), (1396: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1379: 3), (1395: 6), (1396: 5), (1397: 1), (1400: 1), (1401: 2), (1428: 2), (1430: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 25 calls to RUCoP, which took 144 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
