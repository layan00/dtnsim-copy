The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1414(1 to 11), 1433(3 to 10), 1434(4 to 6), 1435(7 to 9), 1445(12 to 4), 1446(12 to 5), 1475(8 to 1), 1483(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1433: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1414: 3), (1433: 4), (1434: 4), (1435: 3), (1445: 2), (1446: 3), (1475: 4), (1483: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 134 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
