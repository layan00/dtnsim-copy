The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
989(1 to 11), 1004(3 to 10), 1005(4 to 6), 1006(7 to 9), 1010(12 to 4), 1011(12 to 5), 1037(8 to 1), 1044(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(989: 60.000000), (1044: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(989: 3), (1004: 2), (1005: 3), (1006: 1), (1010: 1), (1011: 2), (1037: 3), (1044: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 104 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
