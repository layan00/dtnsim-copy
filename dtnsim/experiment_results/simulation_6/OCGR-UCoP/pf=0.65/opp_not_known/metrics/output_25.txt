The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 11), 219(3 to 10), 220(4 to 6), 221(7 to 9), 223(12 to 4), 224(12 to 5), 251(8 to 1), 254(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 3), (219: 2), (220: 5), (221: 1), (223: 1), (224: 2), (251: 1), (254: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 136 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
