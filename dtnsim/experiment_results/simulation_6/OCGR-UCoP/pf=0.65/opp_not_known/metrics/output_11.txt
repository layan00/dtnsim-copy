The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
610(1 to 11), 627(3 to 10), 628(4 to 6), 629(7 to 9), 635(12 to 4), 636(12 to 5), 665(8 to 1), 668(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(610: 60.000000), (628: 55.000000), (629: 45.000000), (635: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(610: 3), (627: 4), (628: 5), (629: 3), (635: 2), (636: 3), (665: 1), (668: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 100 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
