The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1773(1 to 11), 1790(3 to 10), 1791(4 to 6), 1792(7 to 9), 1795(12 to 4), 1796(12 to 5), 1821(8 to 1), 1826(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1773: 3), (1790: 2), (1791: 5), (1792: 3), (1795: 1), (1796: 2), (1821: 1), (1826: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 162 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
