The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
996(1 to 11), 1012(3 to 10), 1013(4 to 6), 1014(7 to 9), 1018(12 to 4), 1019(12 to 5), 1045(8 to 1), 1049(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(996: 3), (1012: 3), (1013: 3), (1014: 1), (1018: 1), (1019: 2), (1045: 1), (1049: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 125 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
