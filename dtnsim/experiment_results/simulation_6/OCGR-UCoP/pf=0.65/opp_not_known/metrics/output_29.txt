The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1790(1 to 11), 1808(3 to 10), 1809(4 to 6), 1810(7 to 9), 1813(12 to 4), 1814(12 to 5), 1843(8 to 1), 1849(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1849: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1790: 3), (1808: 2), (1809: 3), (1810: 1), (1813: 2), (1814: 2), (1843: 1), (1849: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 71 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
