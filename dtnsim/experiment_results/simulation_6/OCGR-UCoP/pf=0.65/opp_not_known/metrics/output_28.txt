The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1393(1 to 11), 1410(3 to 10), 1411(4 to 6), 1412(7 to 9), 1416(12 to 4), 1417(12 to 5), 1446(8 to 1), 1449(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1393: 3), (1410: 2), (1411: 5), (1412: 2), (1416: 2), (1417: 3), (1446: 2), (1449: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 132 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
