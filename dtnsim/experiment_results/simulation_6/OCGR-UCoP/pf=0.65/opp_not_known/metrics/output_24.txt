The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1813(1 to 11), 1830(3 to 10), 1831(4 to 6), 1832(7 to 9), 1834(12 to 4), 1835(12 to 5), 1861(8 to 1), 1867(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1830: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1813: 3), (1830: 4), (1831: 5), (1832: 2), (1834: 1), (1835: 1), (1861: 1), (1867: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 134 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
