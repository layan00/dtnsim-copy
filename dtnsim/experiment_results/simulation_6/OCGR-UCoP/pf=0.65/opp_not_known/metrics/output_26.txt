The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
590(1 to 11), 606(3 to 10), 607(4 to 6), 608(7 to 9), 610(12 to 4), 611(12 to 5), 638(8 to 1), 646(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(590: 3), (606: 4), (607: 5), (608: 1), (610: 2), (611: 2), (638: 2), (646: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 163 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
