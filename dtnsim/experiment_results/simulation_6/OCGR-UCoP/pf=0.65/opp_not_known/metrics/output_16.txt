The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
599(1 to 11), 617(3 to 10), 618(4 to 6), 619(7 to 9), 622(12 to 4), 623(12 to 5), 651(8 to 1), 653(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(599: 3), (617: 2), (618: 3), (619: 2), (622: 2), (623: 2), (651: 1), (653: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 81 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
