The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 11), 226(3 to 10), 227(4 to 6), 228(7 to 9), 231(12 to 4), 232(12 to 5), 259(8 to 1), 262(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 60.000000), (227: 55.000000), (262: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 3), (226: 3), (227: 5), (228: 1), (231: 1), (232: 2), (259: 1), (262: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 115 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
