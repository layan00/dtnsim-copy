The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(1 to 11), 236(3 to 10), 237(4 to 6), 238(7 to 9), 242(12 to 4), 243(12 to 5), 272(8 to 1), 281(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 15.000000), (237: 25.000000), (281: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 3), (236: 5), (237: 4), (238: 2), (242: 1), (243: 2), (272: 1), (281: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
