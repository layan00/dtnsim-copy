The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1422(1 to 11), 1440(3 to 10), 1441(4 to 6), 1442(7 to 9), 1444(12 to 4), 1445(12 to 5), 1470(8 to 1), 1477(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1422: 3), (1440: 3), (1441: 4), (1442: 2), (1444: 1), (1445: 2), (1470: 1), (1477: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 107 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
