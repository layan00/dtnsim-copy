The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1765(1 to 11), 1783(3 to 10), 1784(4 to 6), 1785(7 to 9), 1792(12 to 4), 1793(12 to 5), 1818(8 to 1), 1823(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1785: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1765: 3), (1783: 2), (1784: 6), (1785: 3), (1792: 1), (1793: 2), (1818: 1), (1823: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 124 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
