The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
990(1 to 11), 1008(3 to 10), 1009(4 to 6), 1010(7 to 9), 1014(12 to 4), 1015(12 to 5), 1042(8 to 1), 1049(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(990: 60.000000), (1008: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(990: 3), (1008: 4), (1009: 5), (1010: 2), (1014: 1), (1015: 2), (1042: 1), (1049: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 99 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
