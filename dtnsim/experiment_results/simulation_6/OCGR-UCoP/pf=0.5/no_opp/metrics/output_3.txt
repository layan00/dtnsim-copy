The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
391(1 to 11), 396(3 to 10), 397(4 to 6), 398(7 to 9), 401(12 to 4), 402(12 to 5), 406(8 to 1), 410(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(391: 3), (396: 3), (397: 2), (398: 2), (401: 1), (402: 1), (406: 2), (410: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
