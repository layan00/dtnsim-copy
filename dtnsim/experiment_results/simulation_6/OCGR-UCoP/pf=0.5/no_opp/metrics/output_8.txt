The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
383(1 to 11), 388(3 to 10), 389(4 to 6), 390(7 to 9), 393(12 to 4), 394(12 to 5), 398(8 to 1), 405(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(388: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(383: 4), (388: 4), (389: 2), (390: 2), (393: 1), (394: 1), (398: 1), (405: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 383: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 388: (to: 6, time: 50.000000),
