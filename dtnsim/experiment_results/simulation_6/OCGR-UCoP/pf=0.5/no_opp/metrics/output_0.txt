The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
74(1 to 11), 80(3 to 10), 81(4 to 6), 82(7 to 9), 92(12 to 4), 93(12 to 5), 96(8 to 1), 108(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(74: 5), (80: 3), (81: 7), (82: 3), (92: 1), (93: 1), (96: 1), (108: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 63 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
