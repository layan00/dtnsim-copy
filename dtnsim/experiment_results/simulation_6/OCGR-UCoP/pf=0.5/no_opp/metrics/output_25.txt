The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(1 to 11), 68(3 to 10), 69(4 to 6), 70(7 to 9), 74(12 to 4), 75(12 to 5), 79(8 to 1), 83(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(70: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 4), (68: 2), (69: 2), (70: 3), (74: 1), (75: 1), (79: 1), (83: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 66: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000),
