The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
392(1 to 11), 398(3 to 10), 399(4 to 6), 400(7 to 9), 403(12 to 4), 404(12 to 5), 406(8 to 1), 413(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(392: 4), (398: 3), (399: 4), (400: 2), (403: 1), (404: 1), (406: 1), (413: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
