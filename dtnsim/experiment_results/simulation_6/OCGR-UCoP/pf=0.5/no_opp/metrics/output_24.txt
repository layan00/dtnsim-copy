The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
496(1 to 11), 501(3 to 10), 502(4 to 6), 503(7 to 9), 508(12 to 4), 509(12 to 5), 512(8 to 1), 519(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(501: 35.000000), (508: 85.000000), (519: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(496: 4), (501: 4), (502: 3), (503: 2), (508: 2), (509: 1), (512: 1), (519: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
