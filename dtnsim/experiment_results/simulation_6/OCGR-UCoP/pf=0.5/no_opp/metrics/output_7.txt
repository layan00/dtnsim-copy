The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
281(1 to 11), 282(3 to 10), 283(4 to 6), 284(7 to 9), 290(12 to 4), 291(12 to 5), 294(8 to 1), 302(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(281: 60.000000), (302: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(281: 5), (282: 2), (283: 3), (284: 2), (290: 1), (291: 1), (294: 3), (302: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
