The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
284(1 to 11), 287(3 to 10), 288(4 to 6), 289(7 to 9), 296(12 to 4), 297(12 to 5), 300(8 to 1), 310(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(284: 60.000000), (287: 35.000000), (288: 25.000000), (310: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(284: 6), (287: 4), (288: 4), (289: 3), (296: 1), (297: 1), (300: 1), (310: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
