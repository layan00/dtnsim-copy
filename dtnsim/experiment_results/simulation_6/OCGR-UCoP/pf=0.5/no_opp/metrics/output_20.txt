The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
77(1 to 11), 87(3 to 10), 88(4 to 6), 89(7 to 9), 99(12 to 4), 100(12 to 5), 104(8 to 1), 110(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(77: 4), (87: 3), (88: 4), (89: 3), (99: 1), (100: 1), (104: 1), (110: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
