The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(1 to 11), 77(3 to 10), 78(4 to 6), 79(7 to 9), 84(12 to 4), 85(12 to 5), 89(8 to 1), 91(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(70: 60.000000), (78: 45.000000), (84: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 4), (77: 3), (78: 3), (79: 3), (84: 2), (85: 1), (89: 1), (91: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
