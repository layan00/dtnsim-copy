The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
71(1 to 11), 75(3 to 10), 76(4 to 6), 77(7 to 9), 86(12 to 4), 87(12 to 5), 90(8 to 1), 99(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(75: 35.000000), (76: 45.000000), (77: 25.000000), (99: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(71: 4), (75: 4), (76: 6), (77: 3), (86: 1), (87: 1), (90: 1), (99: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
