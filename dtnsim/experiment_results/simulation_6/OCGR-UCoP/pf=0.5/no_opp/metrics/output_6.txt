The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
175(1 to 11), 181(3 to 10), 182(4 to 6), 183(7 to 9), 189(12 to 4), 190(12 to 5), 196(8 to 1), 204(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(175: 3), (181: 4), (182: 3), (183: 2), (189: 2), (190: 4), (196: 1), (204: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
