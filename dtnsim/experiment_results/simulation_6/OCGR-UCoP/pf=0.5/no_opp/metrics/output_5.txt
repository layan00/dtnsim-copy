The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
68(1 to 11), 73(3 to 10), 74(4 to 6), 75(7 to 9), 82(12 to 4), 83(12 to 5), 85(8 to 1), 89(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(75: 25.000000), (89: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(68: 4), (73: 3), (74: 2), (75: 3), (82: 1), (83: 1), (85: 1), (89: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 68: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
