The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
379(1 to 11), 383(3 to 10), 384(4 to 6), 385(7 to 9), 393(12 to 4), 394(12 to 5), 400(8 to 1), 408(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(385: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(379: 5), (383: 2), (384: 2), (385: 3), (393: 2), (394: 4), (400: 2), (408: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
