The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
379(1 to 11), 383(3 to 10), 384(4 to 6), 385(7 to 9), 391(12 to 4), 392(12 to 5), 396(8 to 1), 405(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(379: 60.000000), (391: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(379: 5), (383: 3), (384: 2), (385: 2), (391: 2), (392: 1), (396: 2), (405: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
