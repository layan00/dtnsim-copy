The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(1 to 11), 188(3 to 10), 189(4 to 6), 190(7 to 9), 198(12 to 4), 199(12 to 5), 204(8 to 1), 207(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(188: 35.000000), (190: 45.000000), (198: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 4), (188: 4), (189: 2), (190: 3), (198: 2), (199: 3), (204: 1), (207: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
