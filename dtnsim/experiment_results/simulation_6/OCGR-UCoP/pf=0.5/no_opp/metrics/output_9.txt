The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(1 to 11), 485(3 to 10), 486(4 to 6), 487(7 to 9), 491(12 to 4), 492(12 to 5), 493(8 to 1), 499(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(487: 45.000000), (499: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 5), (485: 2), (486: 2), (487: 3), (491: 1), (492: 1), (493: 1), (499: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 481: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
