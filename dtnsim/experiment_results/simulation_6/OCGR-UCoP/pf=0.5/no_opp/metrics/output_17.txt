The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
270(1 to 11), 275(3 to 10), 276(4 to 6), 277(7 to 9), 282(12 to 4), 283(12 to 5), 285(8 to 1), 293(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(275: 35.000000), (282: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(270: 3), (275: 4), (276: 3), (277: 3), (282: 2), (283: 1), (285: 3), (293: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
