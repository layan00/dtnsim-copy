The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
490(1 to 11), 495(3 to 10), 496(4 to 6), 497(7 to 9), 502(12 to 4), 503(12 to 5), 508(8 to 1), 516(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(490: 5), (495: 2), (496: 3), (497: 2), (502: 2), (503: 2), (508: 1), (516: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
