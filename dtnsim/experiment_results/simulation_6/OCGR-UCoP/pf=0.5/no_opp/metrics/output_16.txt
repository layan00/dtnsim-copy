The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(1 to 11), 177(3 to 10), 178(4 to 6), 179(7 to 9), 182(12 to 4), 183(12 to 5), 187(8 to 1), 191(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(178: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 3), (177: 3), (178: 3), (179: 3), (182: 2), (183: 2), (187: 1), (191: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
