The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
398(1 to 11), 404(3 to 10), 405(4 to 6), 406(7 to 9), 417(12 to 4), 418(12 to 5), 425(8 to 1), 433(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(398: 6), (404: 3), (405: 4), (406: 3), (417: 2), (418: 3), (425: 4), (433: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
