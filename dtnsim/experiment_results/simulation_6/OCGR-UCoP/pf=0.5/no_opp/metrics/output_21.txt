The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
187(1 to 11), 193(3 to 10), 194(4 to 6), 195(7 to 9), 203(12 to 4), 204(12 to 5), 207(8 to 1), 211(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(187: 3), (193: 3), (194: 3), (195: 2), (203: 1), (204: 2), (207: 1), (211: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
