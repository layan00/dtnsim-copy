The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
515(1 to 11), 521(3 to 10), 522(4 to 6), 523(7 to 9), 529(12 to 4), 530(12 to 5), 533(8 to 1), 538(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(515: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(515: 5), (521: 3), (522: 2), (523: 3), (529: 1), (530: 1), (533: 1), (538: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
