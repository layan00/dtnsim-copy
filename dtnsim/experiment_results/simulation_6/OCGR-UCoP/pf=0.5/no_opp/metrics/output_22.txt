The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
286(1 to 11), 293(3 to 10), 294(4 to 6), 295(7 to 9), 302(12 to 4), 303(12 to 5), 306(8 to 1), 312(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(312: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(286: 3), (293: 3), (294: 3), (295: 2), (302: 1), (303: 2), (306: 1), (312: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
