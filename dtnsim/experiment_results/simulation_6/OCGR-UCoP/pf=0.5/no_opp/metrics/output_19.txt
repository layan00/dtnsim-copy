The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
489(1 to 11), 494(3 to 10), 495(4 to 6), 496(7 to 9), 504(12 to 4), 505(12 to 5), 509(8 to 1), 520(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(495: 55.000000), (496: 25.000000), (505: 15.000000), (520: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(489: 3), (494: 2), (495: 7), (496: 3), (504: 1), (505: 4), (509: 1), (520: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
