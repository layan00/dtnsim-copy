The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1851(1 to 11), 1870(3 to 10), 1871(4 to 6), 1872(7 to 9), 1880(12 to 4), 1881(12 to 5), 1909(8 to 1), 1920(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1871: 55.000000), (1872: 25.000000), (1881: 15.000000), (1920: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1851: 3), (1870: 2), (1871: 7), (1872: 3), (1880: 1), (1881: 4), (1909: 1), (1920: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
