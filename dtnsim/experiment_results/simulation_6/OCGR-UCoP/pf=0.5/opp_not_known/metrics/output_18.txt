The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1435(1 to 11), 1453(3 to 10), 1454(4 to 6), 1455(7 to 9), 1459(12 to 4), 1460(12 to 5), 1488(8 to 1), 1496(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1435: 60.000000), (1453: 55.000000), (1459: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1435: 3), (1453: 6), (1454: 5), (1455: 2), (1459: 2), (1460: 2), (1488: 2), (1496: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 143 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
