The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
621(1 to 11), 639(3 to 10), 640(4 to 6), 641(7 to 9), 647(12 to 4), 648(12 to 5), 678(8 to 1), 686(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(621: 3), (639: 4), (640: 3), (641: 2), (647: 2), (648: 4), (678: 1), (686: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
