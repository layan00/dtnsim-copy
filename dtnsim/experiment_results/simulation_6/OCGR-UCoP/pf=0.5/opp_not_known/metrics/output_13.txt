The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1452(1 to 11), 1472(3 to 10), 1473(4 to 6), 1474(7 to 9), 1485(12 to 4), 1486(12 to 5), 1518(8 to 1), 1525(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1472: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1452: 3), (1472: 5), (1473: 4), (1474: 3), (1485: 2), (1486: 3), (1518: 4), (1525: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 150 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
