The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1025(1 to 11), 1043(3 to 10), 1044(4 to 6), 1045(7 to 9), 1049(12 to 4), 1050(12 to 5), 1078(8 to 1), 1085(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1025: 60.000000), (1043: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1025: 3), (1043: 4), (1044: 5), (1045: 2), (1049: 2), (1050: 2), (1078: 1), (1085: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
