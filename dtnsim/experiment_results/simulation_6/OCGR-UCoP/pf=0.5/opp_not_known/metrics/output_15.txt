The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 11), 233(3 to 10), 234(4 to 6), 235(7 to 9), 240(12 to 4), 241(12 to 5), 271(8 to 1), 273(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 60.000000), (233: 15.000000), (234: 45.000000), (240: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 3), (233: 5), (234: 3), (235: 3), (240: 2), (241: 1), (271: 1), (273: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 88 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
