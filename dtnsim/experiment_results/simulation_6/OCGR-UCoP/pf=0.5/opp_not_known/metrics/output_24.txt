The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1856(1 to 11), 1874(3 to 10), 1875(4 to 6), 1876(7 to 9), 1880(12 to 4), 1881(12 to 5), 1908(8 to 1), 1915(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1874: 35.000000), (1880: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1856: 3), (1874: 4), (1875: 3), (1876: 2), (1880: 2), (1881: 2), (1908: 1), (1915: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 107 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
