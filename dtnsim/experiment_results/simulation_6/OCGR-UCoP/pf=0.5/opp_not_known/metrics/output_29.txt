The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1849(1 to 11), 1867(3 to 10), 1868(4 to 6), 1869(7 to 9), 1872(12 to 4), 1873(12 to 5), 1902(8 to 1), 1909(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1909: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1849: 3), (1867: 2), (1868: 3), (1869: 1), (1872: 2), (1873: 2), (1902: 1), (1909: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 71 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
