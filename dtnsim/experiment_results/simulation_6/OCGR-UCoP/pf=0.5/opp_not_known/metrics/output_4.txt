The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1852(1 to 11), 1871(3 to 10), 1872(4 to 6), 1873(7 to 9), 1875(12 to 4), 1876(12 to 5), 1904(8 to 1), 1915(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1852: 60.000000), (1871: 35.000000), (1875: 85.000000), (1876: 85.000000), (1904: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1852: 3), (1871: 4), (1872: 3), (1873: 2), (1875: 2), (1876: 5), (1904: 4), (1915: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 67 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
