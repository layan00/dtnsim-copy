The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1039(1 to 11), 1060(3 to 10), 1061(4 to 6), 1062(7 to 9), 1069(12 to 4), 1070(12 to 5), 1099(8 to 1), 1105(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1060: 15.000000), (1105: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1039: 3), (1060: 5), (1061: 3), (1062: 2), (1069: 1), (1070: 2), (1099: 1), (1105: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 114 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
