The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
635(1 to 11), 655(3 to 10), 656(4 to 6), 657(7 to 9), 665(12 to 4), 666(12 to 5), 695(8 to 1), 699(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(655: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(635: 3), (655: 5), (656: 3), (657: 2), (665: 1), (666: 2), (695: 1), (699: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 127 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
