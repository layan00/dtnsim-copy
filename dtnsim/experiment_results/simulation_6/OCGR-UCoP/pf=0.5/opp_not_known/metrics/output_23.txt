The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1450(1 to 11), 1468(3 to 10), 1469(4 to 6), 1470(7 to 9), 1473(12 to 4), 1474(12 to 5), 1500(8 to 1), 1507(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1468: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1450: 3), (1468: 6), (1469: 4), (1470: 2), (1473: 1), (1474: 2), (1500: 1), (1507: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 124 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
