The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
612(1 to 11), 629(3 to 10), 630(4 to 6), 631(7 to 9), 634(12 to 4), 635(12 to 5), 662(8 to 1), 677(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(630: 25.000000), (662: 15.000000), (677: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(612: 3), (629: 4), (630: 4), (631: 1), (634: 2), (635: 2), (662: 4), (677: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 96 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
