The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1870(1 to 11), 1889(3 to 10), 1890(4 to 6), 1891(7 to 9), 1896(12 to 4), 1897(12 to 5), 1926(8 to 1), 1930(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1870: 60.000000), (1889: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1870: 3), (1889: 5), (1890: 5), (1891: 3), (1896: 1), (1897: 2), (1926: 1), (1930: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 161 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
