The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 11), 230(3 to 10), 231(4 to 6), 232(7 to 9), 236(12 to 4), 237(12 to 5), 263(8 to 1), 266(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(230: 55.000000), (266: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 3), (230: 6), (231: 5), (232: 1), (236: 1), (237: 2), (263: 1), (266: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 147 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
