The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1027(1 to 11), 1042(3 to 10), 1043(4 to 6), 1044(7 to 9), 1048(12 to 4), 1049(12 to 5), 1076(8 to 1), 1083(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1027: 60.000000), (1083: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1027: 3), (1042: 2), (1043: 3), (1044: 1), (1048: 1), (1049: 2), (1076: 3), (1083: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
