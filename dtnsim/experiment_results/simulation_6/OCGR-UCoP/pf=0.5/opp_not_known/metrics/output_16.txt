The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
618(1 to 11), 636(3 to 10), 637(4 to 6), 638(7 to 9), 641(12 to 4), 642(12 to 5), 670(8 to 1), 674(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(618: 60.000000), (636: 55.000000), (637: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(618: 3), (636: 6), (637: 3), (638: 3), (641: 2), (642: 2), (670: 1), (674: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 78 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
