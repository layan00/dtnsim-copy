The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
635(1 to 11), 653(3 to 10), 654(4 to 6), 655(7 to 9), 661(12 to 4), 662(12 to 5), 689(8 to 1), 694(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(661: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(635: 3), (653: 5), (654: 5), (655: 1), (661: 2), (662: 2), (689: 1), (694: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 140 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
