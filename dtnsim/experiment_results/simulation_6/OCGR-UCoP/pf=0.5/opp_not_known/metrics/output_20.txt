The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(1 to 11), 243(3 to 10), 244(4 to 6), 245(7 to 9), 255(12 to 4), 256(12 to 5), 286(8 to 1), 292(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 15.000000), (292: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 3), (243: 5), (244: 4), (245: 3), (255: 1), (256: 2), (286: 1), (292: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 166 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
