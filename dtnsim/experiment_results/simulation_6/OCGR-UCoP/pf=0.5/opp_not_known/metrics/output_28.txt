The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1438(1 to 11), 1455(3 to 10), 1456(4 to 6), 1457(7 to 9), 1462(12 to 4), 1463(12 to 5), 1493(8 to 1), 1499(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1456: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1438: 3), (1455: 2), (1456: 5), (1457: 2), (1462: 2), (1463: 4), (1493: 2), (1499: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 125 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
