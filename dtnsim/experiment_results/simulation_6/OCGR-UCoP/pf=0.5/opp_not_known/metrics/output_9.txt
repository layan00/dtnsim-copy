The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1831(1 to 11), 1848(3 to 10), 1849(4 to 6), 1850(7 to 9), 1853(12 to 4), 1854(12 to 5), 1879(8 to 1), 1884(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1850: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1831: 3), (1848: 2), (1849: 5), (1850: 3), (1853: 1), (1854: 2), (1879: 1), (1884: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 25 calls to RUCoP, which took 144 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
