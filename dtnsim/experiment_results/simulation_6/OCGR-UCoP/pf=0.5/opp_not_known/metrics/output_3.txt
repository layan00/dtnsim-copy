The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1443(1 to 11), 1460(3 to 10), 1461(4 to 6), 1462(7 to 9), 1465(12 to 4), 1466(12 to 5), 1494(8 to 1), 1498(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1460: 55.000000), (1461: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1443: 3), (1460: 6), (1461: 5), (1462: 2), (1465: 1), (1466: 2), (1494: 2), (1498: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 31 calls to RUCoP, which took 179 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
