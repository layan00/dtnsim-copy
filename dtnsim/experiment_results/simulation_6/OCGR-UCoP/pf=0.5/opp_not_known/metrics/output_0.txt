The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 11), 238(3 to 10), 239(4 to 6), 240(7 to 9), 250(12 to 4), 251(12 to 5), 279(8 to 1), 290(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 60.000000), (238: 15.000000), (240: 25.000000), (290: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 3), (238: 5), (239: 7), (240: 3), (250: 1), (251: 2), (279: 1), (290: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
