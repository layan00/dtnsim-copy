The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1373(1 to 11), 1379(3 to 10), 1380(4 to 6), 1381(7 to 9), 1384(12 to 4), 1385(12 to 5), 1402(8 to 1), 1409(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1379: 35.000000), (1384: 85.000000), (1385: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1373: 3), (1379: 4), (1380: 2), (1381: 2), (1384: 3), (1385: 5), (1402: 1), (1409: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
