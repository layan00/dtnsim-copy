The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1376(1 to 11), 1382(3 to 10), 1383(4 to 6), 1384(7 to 9), 1388(12 to 4), 1389(12 to 5), 1411(8 to 1), 1417(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1388: 25.000000), (1389: 45.000000), (1417: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1376: 3), (1382: 2), (1383: 2), (1384: 2), (1388: 5), (1389: 7), (1411: 1), (1417: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
