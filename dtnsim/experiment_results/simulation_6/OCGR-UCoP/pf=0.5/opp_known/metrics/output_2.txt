The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
784(1 to 11), 789(3 to 10), 790(4 to 6), 791(7 to 9), 797(12 to 4), 798(12 to 5), 815(8 to 1), 822(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(784: 60.000000), (789: 35.000000), (822: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(784: 3), (789: 4), (790: 2), (791: 3), (797: 2), (798: 2), (815: 1), (822: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
