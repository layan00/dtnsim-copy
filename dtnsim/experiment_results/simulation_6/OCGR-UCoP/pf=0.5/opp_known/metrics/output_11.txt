The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
495(1 to 11), 500(3 to 10), 501(4 to 6), 502(7 to 9), 508(12 to 4), 509(12 to 5), 534(8 to 1), 537(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(495: 60.000000), (500: 35.000000), (502: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(495: 3), (500: 4), (501: 2), (502: 3), (508: 5), (509: 5), (534: 1), (537: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
