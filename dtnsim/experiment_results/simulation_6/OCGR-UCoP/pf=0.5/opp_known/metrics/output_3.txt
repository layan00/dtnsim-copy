The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1069(1 to 11), 1074(3 to 10), 1075(4 to 6), 1076(7 to 9), 1079(12 to 4), 1080(12 to 5), 1098(8 to 1), 1104(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1074: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1069: 3), (1074: 6), (1075: 2), (1076: 2), (1079: 2), (1080: 2), (1098: 3), (1104: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
