The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(1 to 11), 219(3 to 10), 220(4 to 6), 221(7 to 9), 228(12 to 4), 229(12 to 5), 249(8 to 1), 255(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 15.000000), (255: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 3), (219: 4), (220: 2), (221: 3), (228: 2), (229: 2), (249: 1), (255: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
