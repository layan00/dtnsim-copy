The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 11), 214(3 to 10), 215(4 to 6), 216(7 to 9), 223(12 to 4), 224(12 to 5), 242(8 to 1), 251(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 60.000000), (214: 15.000000), (216: 25.000000), (251: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 3), (214: 4), (215: 2), (216: 3), (223: 2), (224: 2), (242: 1), (251: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
