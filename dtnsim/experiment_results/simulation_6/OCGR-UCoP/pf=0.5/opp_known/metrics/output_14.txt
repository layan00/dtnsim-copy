The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1387(1 to 11), 1394(3 to 10), 1395(4 to 6), 1396(7 to 9), 1401(12 to 4), 1402(12 to 5), 1421(8 to 1), 1425(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1387: 60.000000), (1394: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1387: 3), (1394: 4), (1395: 2), (1396: 3), (1401: 2), (1402: 2), (1421: 1), (1425: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
