The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
789(1 to 11), 792(3 to 10), 793(4 to 6), 794(7 to 9), 798(12 to 4), 799(12 to 5), 816(8 to 1), 823(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(789: 60.000000), (823: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(789: 3), (792: 2), (793: 2), (794: 2), (798: 2), (799: 2), (816: 3), (823: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
