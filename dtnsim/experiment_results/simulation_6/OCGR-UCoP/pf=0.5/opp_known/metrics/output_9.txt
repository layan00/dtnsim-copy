The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1355(1 to 11), 1360(3 to 10), 1361(4 to 6), 1362(7 to 9), 1365(12 to 4), 1366(12 to 5), 1381(8 to 1), 1386(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1362: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1355: 3), (1360: 2), (1361: 2), (1362: 3), (1365: 2), (1366: 2), (1381: 1), (1386: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
