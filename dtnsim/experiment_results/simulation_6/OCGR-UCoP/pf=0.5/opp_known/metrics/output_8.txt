The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1072(1 to 11), 1078(3 to 10), 1079(4 to 6), 1080(7 to 9), 1082(12 to 4), 1083(12 to 5), 1101(8 to 1), 1108(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1072: 60.000000), (1078: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1072: 3), (1078: 4), (1079: 2), (1080: 2), (1082: 2), (1083: 2), (1101: 1), (1108: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
