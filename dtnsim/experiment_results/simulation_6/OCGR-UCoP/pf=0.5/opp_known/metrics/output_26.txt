The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
480(1 to 11), 485(3 to 10), 486(4 to 6), 487(7 to 9), 490(12 to 4), 491(12 to 5), 508(8 to 1), 520(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(520: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(480: 3), (485: 4), (486: 2), (487: 2), (490: 3), (491: 3), (508: 3), (520: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
