The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(1 to 11), 206(3 to 10), 207(4 to 6), 208(7 to 9), 214(12 to 4), 215(12 to 5), 231(8 to 1), 235(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 55.000000), (208: 25.000000), (235: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 3), (206: 6), (207: 2), (208: 3), (214: 2), (215: 2), (231: 1), (235: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
