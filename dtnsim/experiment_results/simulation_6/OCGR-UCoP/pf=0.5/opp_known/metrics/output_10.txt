The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 11), 208(3 to 10), 209(4 to 6), 210(7 to 9), 215(12 to 4), 216(12 to 5), 233(8 to 1), 241(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 60.000000), (208: 35.000000), (210: 25.000000), (241: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 3), (208: 4), (209: 2), (210: 3), (215: 2), (216: 2), (233: 1), (241: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
