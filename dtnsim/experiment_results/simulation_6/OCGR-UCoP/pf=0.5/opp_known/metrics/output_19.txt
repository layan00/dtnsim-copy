The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1384(1 to 11), 1391(3 to 10), 1392(4 to 6), 1393(7 to 9), 1398(12 to 4), 1399(12 to 5), 1423(8 to 1), 1430(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1393: 25.000000), (1430: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1384: 3), (1391: 2), (1392: 2), (1393: 3), (1398: 5), (1399: 5), (1423: 1), (1430: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
