The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
795(1 to 11), 804(3 to 10), 805(4 to 6), 806(7 to 9), 811(12 to 4), 812(12 to 5), 832(8 to 1), 838(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(804: 15.000000), (838: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(795: 3), (804: 4), (805: 2), (806: 2), (811: 3), (812: 3), (832: 1), (838: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
