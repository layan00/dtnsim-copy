The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
500(1 to 11), 506(3 to 10), 507(4 to 6), 508(7 to 9), 513(12 to 4), 514(12 to 5), 534(8 to 1), 539(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(506: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(500: 3), (506: 4), (507: 2), (508: 2), (513: 3), (514: 3), (534: 1), (539: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
