The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 11), 202(3 to 10), 203(4 to 6), 204(7 to 9), 207(12 to 4), 208(12 to 5), 226(8 to 1), 230(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(204: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 3), (202: 2), (203: 2), (204: 3), (207: 2), (208: 2), (226: 1), (230: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
