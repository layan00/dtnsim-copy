The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 11), 209(3 to 10), 210(4 to 6), 211(7 to 9), 215(12 to 4), 216(12 to 5), 236(8 to 1), 238(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 60.000000), (209: 15.000000), (215: 85.000000), (216: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 3), (209: 4), (210: 2), (211: 3), (215: 3), (216: 5), (236: 1), (238: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
