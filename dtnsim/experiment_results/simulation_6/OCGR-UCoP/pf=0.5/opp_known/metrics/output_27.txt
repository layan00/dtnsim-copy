The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
771(1 to 11), 777(3 to 10), 778(4 to 6), 779(7 to 9), 783(12 to 4), 784(12 to 5), 805(8 to 1), 812(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(771: 60.000000), (777: 35.000000), (783: 25.000000), (784: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(771: 3), (777: 4), (778: 2), (779: 2), (783: 5), (784: 7), (805: 1), (812: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
