The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
492(1 to 11), 498(3 to 10), 499(4 to 6), 500(7 to 9), 505(12 to 4), 506(12 to 5), 534(8 to 1), 541(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(505: 85.000000), (506: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(492: 3), (498: 4), (499: 2), (500: 2), (505: 8), (506: 6), (534: 1), (541: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
