The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1087(1 to 11), 1093(3 to 10), 1094(4 to 6), 1095(7 to 9), 1098(12 to 4), 1099(12 to 5), 1115(8 to 1), 1120(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1093: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1087: 3), (1093: 6), (1094: 2), (1095: 2), (1098: 2), (1099: 2), (1115: 1), (1120: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
