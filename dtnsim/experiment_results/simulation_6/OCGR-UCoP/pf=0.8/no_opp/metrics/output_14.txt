The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
373(1 to 11), 375(3 to 10), 376(4 to 6), 377(7 to 9), 379(12 to 4), 380(12 to 5), 381(8 to 1), 385(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(373: 3), (375: 3), (376: 2), (377: 3), (379: 1), (380: 1), (381: 1), (385: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
