The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
146(1 to 11), 150(3 to 10), 151(4 to 6), 152(7 to 9), 155(12 to 4), 156(12 to 5), 158(8 to 1), 160(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(146: 3), (150: 3), (151: 2), (152: 2), (155: 1), (156: 1), (158: 1), (160: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 146: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
