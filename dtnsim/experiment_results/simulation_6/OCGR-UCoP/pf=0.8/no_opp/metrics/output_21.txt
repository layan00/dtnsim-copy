The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
143(1 to 11), 145(3 to 10), 146(4 to 6), 147(7 to 9), 148(12 to 4), 149(12 to 5), 151(8 to 1), 154(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(143: 3), (145: 2), (146: 2), (147: 2), (148: 1), (149: 1), (151: 1), (154: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
