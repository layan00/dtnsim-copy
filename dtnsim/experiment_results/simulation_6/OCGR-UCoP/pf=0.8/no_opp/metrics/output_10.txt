The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
57(1 to 11), 59(3 to 10), 60(4 to 6), 61(7 to 9), 62(12 to 4), 63(12 to 5), 64(8 to 1), 66(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(66: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(57: 4), (59: 2), (60: 2), (61: 2), (62: 1), (63: 1), (64: 1), (66: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 57: (to: 5, time: 0.000000),
