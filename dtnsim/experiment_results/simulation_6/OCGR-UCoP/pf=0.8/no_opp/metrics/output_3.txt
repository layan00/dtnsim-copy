The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
290(1 to 11), 292(3 to 10), 293(4 to 6), 294(7 to 9), 297(12 to 4), 298(12 to 5), 300(8 to 1), 302(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(290: 3), (292: 3), (293: 2), (294: 2), (297: 1), (298: 1), (300: 2), (302: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 290: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 292: (to: 1, time: 25.000000), (to: 6, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 292: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 293: (to: 7, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 300: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 294: (to: 11, time: 20.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000),
