The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
352(1 to 11), 355(3 to 10), 356(4 to 6), 357(7 to 9), 361(12 to 4), 362(12 to 5), 363(8 to 1), 364(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(352: 3), (355: 2), (356: 2), (357: 3), (361: 1), (362: 1), (363: 1), (364: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
