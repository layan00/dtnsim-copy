The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
373(1 to 11), 376(3 to 10), 377(4 to 6), 378(7 to 9), 381(12 to 4), 382(12 to 5), 387(8 to 1), 391(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(373: 4), (376: 2), (377: 3), (378: 2), (381: 2), (382: 1), (387: 1), (391: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
