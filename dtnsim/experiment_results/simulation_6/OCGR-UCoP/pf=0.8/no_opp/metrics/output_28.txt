The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
289(1 to 11), 293(3 to 10), 294(4 to 6), 295(7 to 9), 301(12 to 4), 302(12 to 5), 305(8 to 1), 307(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(289: 4), (293: 2), (294: 2), (295: 3), (301: 2), (302: 3), (305: 1), (307: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
