The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
370(1 to 11), 373(3 to 10), 374(4 to 6), 375(7 to 9), 377(12 to 4), 378(12 to 5), 379(8 to 1), 382(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(370: 3), (373: 2), (374: 2), (375: 2), (377: 1), (378: 1), (379: 1), (382: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 370: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 373: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4:
