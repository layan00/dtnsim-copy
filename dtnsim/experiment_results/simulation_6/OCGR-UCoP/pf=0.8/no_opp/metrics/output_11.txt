The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
133(1 to 11), 135(3 to 10), 136(4 to 6), 137(7 to 9), 140(12 to 4), 141(12 to 5), 145(8 to 1), 147(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(140: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(133: 3), (135: 2), (136: 2), (137: 2), (140: 2), (141: 2), (145: 1), (147: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 133: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 135: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000),
