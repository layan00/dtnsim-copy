The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
294(1 to 11), 296(3 to 10), 297(4 to 6), 298(7 to 9), 300(12 to 4), 301(12 to 5), 305(8 to 1), 309(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(294: 4), (296: 3), (297: 2), (298: 2), (300: 1), (301: 1), (305: 1), (309: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 294: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 294: (to: 6, time: 50.000000),

Node 3: 
Bundle 296: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4:

Node 5: 
Bundle 309: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 80.000000),
