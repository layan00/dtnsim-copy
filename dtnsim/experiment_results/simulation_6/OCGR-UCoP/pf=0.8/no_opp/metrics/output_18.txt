The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
278(1 to 11), 281(3 to 10), 282(4 to 6), 283(7 to 9), 285(12 to 4), 286(12 to 5), 289(8 to 1), 295(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(278: 3), (281: 3), (282: 2), (283: 2), (285: 1), (286: 1), (289: 2), (295: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
