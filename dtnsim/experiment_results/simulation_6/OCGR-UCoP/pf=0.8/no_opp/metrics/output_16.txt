The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
134(1 to 11), 136(3 to 10), 137(4 to 6), 138(7 to 9), 140(12 to 4), 141(12 to 5), 143(8 to 1), 144(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(134: 3), (136: 2), (137: 2), (138: 2), (140: 2), (141: 2), (143: 1), (144: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
