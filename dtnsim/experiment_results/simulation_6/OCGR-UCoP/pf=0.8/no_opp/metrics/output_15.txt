The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
62(1 to 11), 67(3 to 10), 68(4 to 6), 69(7 to 9), 71(12 to 4), 72(12 to 5), 76(8 to 1), 78(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(62: 3), (67: 2), (68: 3), (69: 2), (71: 1), (72: 1), (76: 1), (78: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 62: (to: 5, time: 0.000000),
