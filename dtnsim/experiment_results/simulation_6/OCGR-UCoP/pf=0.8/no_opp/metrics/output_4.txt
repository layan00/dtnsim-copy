The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
365(1 to 11), 369(3 to 10), 370(4 to 6), 371(7 to 9), 372(12 to 4), 373(12 to 5), 376(8 to 1), 388(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(370: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(365: 5), (369: 4), (370: 4), (371: 2), (372: 1), (373: 1), (376: 1), (388: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
