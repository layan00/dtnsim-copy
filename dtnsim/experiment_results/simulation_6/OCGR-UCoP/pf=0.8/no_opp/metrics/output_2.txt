The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 11), 220(3 to 10), 221(4 to 6), 222(7 to 9), 225(12 to 4), 226(12 to 5), 227(8 to 1), 231(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 3), (220: 3), (221: 3), (222: 2), (225: 1), (226: 1), (227: 1), (231: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
