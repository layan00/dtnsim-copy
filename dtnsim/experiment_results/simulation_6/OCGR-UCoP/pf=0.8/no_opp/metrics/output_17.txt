The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 11), 207(3 to 10), 208(4 to 6), 209(7 to 9), 211(12 to 4), 212(12 to 5), 213(8 to 1), 218(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 3), (207: 4), (208: 3), (209: 2), (211: 1), (212: 1), (213: 1), (218: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
