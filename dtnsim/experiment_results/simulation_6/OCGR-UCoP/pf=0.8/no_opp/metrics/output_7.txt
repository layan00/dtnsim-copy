The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 11), 218(3 to 10), 219(4 to 6), 220(7 to 9), 223(12 to 4), 224(12 to 5), 226(8 to 1), 232(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 3), (218: 2), (219: 3), (220: 2), (223: 1), (224: 1), (226: 3), (232: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
