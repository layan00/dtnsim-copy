The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
139(1 to 11), 142(3 to 10), 143(4 to 6), 144(7 to 9), 146(12 to 4), 147(12 to 5), 151(8 to 1), 155(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(139: 4), (142: 3), (143: 3), (144: 2), (146: 1), (147: 1), (151: 1), (155: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 139: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 2, time: 40.000000),
