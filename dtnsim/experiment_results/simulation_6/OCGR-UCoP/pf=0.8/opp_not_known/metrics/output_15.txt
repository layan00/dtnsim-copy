The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 11), 223(3 to 10), 224(4 to 6), 225(7 to 9), 227(12 to 4), 228(12 to 5), 256(8 to 1), 258(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 3), (223: 2), (224: 3), (225: 2), (227: 1), (228: 1), (256: 1), (258: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 206: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 223: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4:

Bundle 225: (to: 11, time: 20.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 256: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 258: (to: 10, time: 50.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000),
