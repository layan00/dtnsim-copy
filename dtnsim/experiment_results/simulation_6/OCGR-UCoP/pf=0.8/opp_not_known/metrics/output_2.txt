The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
973(1 to 11), 989(3 to 10), 990(4 to 6), 991(7 to 9), 994(12 to 4), 995(12 to 5), 1020(8 to 1), 1024(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(973: 3), (989: 3), (990: 3), (991: 1), (994: 1), (995: 1), (1020: 1), (1024: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
