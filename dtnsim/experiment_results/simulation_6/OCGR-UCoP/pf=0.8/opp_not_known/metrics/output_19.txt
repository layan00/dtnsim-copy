The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1709(1 to 11), 1726(3 to 10), 1727(4 to 6), 1728(7 to 9), 1730(12 to 4), 1731(12 to 5), 1756(8 to 1), 1757(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1727: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1709: 3), (1726: 2), (1727: 5), (1728: 1), (1730: 1), (1731: 2), (1756: 1), (1757: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 100 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
