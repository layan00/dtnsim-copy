The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
952(1 to 11), 970(3 to 10), 971(4 to 6), 972(7 to 9), 974(12 to 4), 975(12 to 5), 1000(8 to 1), 1005(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(952: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(952: 3), (970: 4), (971: 3), (972: 2), (974: 1), (975: 1), (1000: 1), (1005: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 90 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 952: (to: 13, time: 0.000000),
