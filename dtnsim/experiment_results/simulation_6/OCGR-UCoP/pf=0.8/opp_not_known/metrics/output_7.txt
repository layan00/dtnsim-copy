The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
967(1 to 11), 982(3 to 10), 983(4 to 6), 984(7 to 9), 987(12 to 4), 988(12 to 5), 1014(8 to 1), 1020(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(967: 3), (982: 2), (983: 3), (984: 1), (987: 1), (988: 1), (1014: 3), (1020: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 125 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
