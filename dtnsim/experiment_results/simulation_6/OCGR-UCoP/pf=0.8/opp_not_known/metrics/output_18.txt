The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1330(1 to 11), 1347(3 to 10), 1348(4 to 6), 1349(7 to 9), 1350(12 to 4), 1351(12 to 5), 1378(8 to 1), 1384(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1330: 3), (1347: 3), (1348: 5), (1349: 1), (1350: 1), (1351: 1), (1378: 2), (1384: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 29 calls to RUCoP, which took 163 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
