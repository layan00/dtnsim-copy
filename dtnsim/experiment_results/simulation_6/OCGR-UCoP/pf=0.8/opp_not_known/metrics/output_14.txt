The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1733(1 to 11), 1749(3 to 10), 1750(4 to 6), 1751(7 to 9), 1753(12 to 4), 1754(12 to 5), 1779(8 to 1), 1783(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1733: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1733: 3), (1749: 3), (1750: 5), (1751: 2), (1753: 1), (1754: 1), (1779: 1), (1783: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 109 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
