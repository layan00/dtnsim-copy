The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
595(1 to 11), 613(3 to 10), 614(4 to 6), 615(7 to 9), 618(12 to 4), 619(12 to 5), 647(8 to 1), 649(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(613: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(595: 3), (613: 5), (614: 5), (615: 1), (618: 1), (619: 1), (647: 1), (649: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 118 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
