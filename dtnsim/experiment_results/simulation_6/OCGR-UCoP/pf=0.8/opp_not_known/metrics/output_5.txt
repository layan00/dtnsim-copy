The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 11), 220(3 to 10), 221(4 to 6), 222(7 to 9), 225(12 to 4), 226(12 to 5), 252(8 to 1), 253(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 3), (220: 6), (221: 5), (222: 1), (225: 1), (226: 1), (252: 1), (253: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 117 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
