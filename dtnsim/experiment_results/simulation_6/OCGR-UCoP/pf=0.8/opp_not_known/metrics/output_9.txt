The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1730(1 to 11), 1747(3 to 10), 1748(4 to 6), 1749(7 to 9), 1751(12 to 4), 1752(12 to 5), 1777(8 to 1), 1780(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1730: 3), (1747: 2), (1748: 5), (1749: 2), (1751: 1), (1752: 2), (1777: 1), (1780: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 132 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
