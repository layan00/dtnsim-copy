The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
970(1 to 11), 988(3 to 10), 989(4 to 6), 990(7 to 9), 993(12 to 4), 994(12 to 5), 1021(8 to 1), 1024(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(970: 3), (988: 3), (989: 3), (990: 2), (993: 1), (994: 2), (1021: 1), (1024: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 129 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
