The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1349(1 to 11), 1365(3 to 10), 1366(4 to 6), 1367(7 to 9), 1370(12 to 4), 1371(12 to 5), 1397(8 to 1), 1408(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1365: 35.000000), (1366: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1349: 3), (1365: 4), (1366: 4), (1367: 1), (1370: 1), (1371: 1), (1397: 4), (1408: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
