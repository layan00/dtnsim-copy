The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(1 to 11), 222(3 to 10), 223(4 to 6), 224(7 to 9), 230(12 to 4), 231(12 to 5), 256(8 to 1), 265(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 25.000000), (265: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 3), (222: 4), (223: 3), (224: 3), (230: 1), (231: 2), (256: 1), (265: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 25 calls to RUCoP, which took 144 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
