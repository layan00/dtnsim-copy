The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
579(1 to 11), 595(3 to 10), 596(4 to 6), 597(7 to 9), 599(12 to 4), 600(12 to 5), 626(8 to 1), 627(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(579: 3), (595: 2), (596: 5), (597: 1), (599: 2), (600: 2), (626: 1), (627: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 62 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
