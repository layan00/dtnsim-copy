The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1729(1 to 11), 1744(3 to 10), 1745(4 to 6), 1746(7 to 9), 1747(12 to 4), 1748(12 to 5), 1774(8 to 1), 1780(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1729: 3), (1744: 4), (1745: 5), (1746: 1), (1747: 1), (1748: 1), (1774: 1), (1780: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 25 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
