The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
954(1 to 11), 971(3 to 10), 972(4 to 6), 973(7 to 9), 976(12 to 4), 977(12 to 5), 1003(8 to 1), 1008(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(954: 60.000000), (971: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(954: 3), (971: 4), (972: 5), (973: 1), (976: 1), (977: 1), (1003: 1), (1008: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
