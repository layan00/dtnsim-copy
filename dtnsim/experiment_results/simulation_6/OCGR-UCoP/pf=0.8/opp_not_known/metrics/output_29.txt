The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1731(1 to 11), 1748(3 to 10), 1749(4 to 6), 1750(7 to 9), 1752(12 to 4), 1753(12 to 5), 1781(8 to 1), 1785(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1731: 3), (1748: 2), (1749: 3), (1750: 1), (1752: 2), (1753: 1), (1781: 1), (1785: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 109 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
