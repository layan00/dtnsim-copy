The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
588(1 to 11), 605(3 to 10), 606(4 to 6), 607(7 to 9), 609(12 to 4), 610(12 to 5), 637(8 to 1), 641(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(588: 3), (605: 3), (606: 3), (607: 2), (609: 1), (610: 1), (637: 1), (641: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
