The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
966(1 to 11), 983(3 to 10), 984(4 to 6), 985(7 to 9), 987(12 to 4), 988(12 to 5), 1013(8 to 1), 1016(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(983: 35.000000), (984: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(966: 3), (983: 4), (984: 5), (985: 2), (987: 1), (988: 2), (1013: 1), (1016: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
