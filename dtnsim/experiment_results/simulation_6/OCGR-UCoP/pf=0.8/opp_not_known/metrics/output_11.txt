The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
581(1 to 11), 597(3 to 10), 598(4 to 6), 599(7 to 9), 602(12 to 4), 603(12 to 5), 631(8 to 1), 633(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(598: 55.000000), (602: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(581: 3), (597: 2), (598: 5), (599: 2), (602: 2), (603: 2), (631: 1), (633: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 79 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
