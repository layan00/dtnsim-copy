The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1352(1 to 11), 1369(3 to 10), 1370(4 to 6), 1371(7 to 9), 1372(12 to 4), 1373(12 to 5), 1398(8 to 1), 1400(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1352: 3), (1369: 2), (1370: 5), (1371: 2), (1372: 1), (1373: 1), (1398: 1), (1400: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 118 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
