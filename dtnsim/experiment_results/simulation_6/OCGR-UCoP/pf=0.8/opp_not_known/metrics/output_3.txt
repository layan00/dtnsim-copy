The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1347(1 to 11), 1363(3 to 10), 1364(4 to 6), 1365(7 to 9), 1368(12 to 4), 1369(12 to 5), 1395(8 to 1), 1397(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1347: 3), (1363: 3), (1364: 5), (1365: 1), (1368: 1), (1369: 1), (1395: 2), (1397: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 132 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
