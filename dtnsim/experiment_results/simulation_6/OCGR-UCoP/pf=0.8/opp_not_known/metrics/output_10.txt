The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 11), 216(3 to 10), 217(4 to 6), 218(7 to 9), 219(12 to 4), 220(12 to 5), 245(8 to 1), 247(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(217: 55.000000), (247: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 3), (216: 2), (217: 5), (218: 1), (219: 1), (220: 2), (245: 1), (247: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 104 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 201: (to: 13, time: 0.000000),
