The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
976(1 to 11), 981(3 to 10), 982(4 to 6), 983(7 to 9), 989(12 to 4), 990(12 to 5), 1005(8 to 1), 1007(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(976: 3), (981: 2), (982: 4), (983: 3), (989: 2), (990: 2), (1005: 1), (1007: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
