The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
436(1 to 11), 439(3 to 10), 440(4 to 6), 441(7 to 9), 443(12 to 4), 444(12 to 5), 460(8 to 1), 465(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(440: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(436: 3), (439: 2), (440: 3), (441: 2), (443: 2), (444: 2), (460: 3), (465: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
