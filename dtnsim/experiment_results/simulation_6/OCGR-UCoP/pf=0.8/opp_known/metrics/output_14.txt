The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1243(1 to 11), 1247(3 to 10), 1248(4 to 6), 1249(7 to 9), 1251(12 to 4), 1252(12 to 5), 1267(8 to 1), 1271(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1243: 60.000000), (1248: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1243: 3), (1247: 4), (1248: 3), (1249: 3), (1251: 1), (1252: 1), (1267: 1), (1271: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
