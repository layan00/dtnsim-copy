The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1238(1 to 11), 1244(3 to 10), 1245(4 to 6), 1246(7 to 9), 1247(12 to 4), 1248(12 to 5), 1264(8 to 1), 1272(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1238: 3), (1244: 4), (1245: 4), (1246: 2), (1247: 1), (1248: 1), (1264: 1), (1272: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
