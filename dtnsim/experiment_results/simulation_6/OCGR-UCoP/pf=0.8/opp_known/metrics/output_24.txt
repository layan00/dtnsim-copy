The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1236(1 to 11), 1239(3 to 10), 1240(4 to 6), 1241(7 to 9), 1242(12 to 4), 1243(12 to 5), 1259(8 to 1), 1265(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1236: 3), (1239: 4), (1240: 4), (1241: 2), (1242: 1), (1243: 1), (1259: 1), (1265: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
