The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
978(1 to 11), 982(3 to 10), 983(4 to 6), 984(7 to 9), 986(12 to 4), 987(12 to 5), 1004(8 to 1), 1008(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(982: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(978: 3), (982: 6), (983: 4), (984: 2), (986: 1), (987: 1), (1004: 1), (1008: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
