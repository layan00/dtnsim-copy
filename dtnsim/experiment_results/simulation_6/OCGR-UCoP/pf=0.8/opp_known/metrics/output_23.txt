The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
978(1 to 11), 983(3 to 10), 984(4 to 6), 985(7 to 9), 986(12 to 4), 987(12 to 5), 1002(8 to 1), 1004(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(984: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(978: 3), (983: 2), (984: 3), (985: 2), (986: 1), (987: 1), (1002: 1), (1004: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 985: (to: 11, time: 20.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 1002: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 1004: (to: 5, time: 50.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000),
