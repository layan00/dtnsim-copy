The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
458(1 to 11), 462(3 to 10), 463(4 to 6), 464(7 to 9), 465(12 to 4), 466(12 to 5), 482(8 to 1), 485(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(458: 3), (462: 2), (463: 4), (464: 2), (465: 1), (466: 1), (482: 1), (485: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
