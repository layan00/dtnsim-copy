The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1242(1 to 11), 1247(3 to 10), 1248(4 to 6), 1249(7 to 9), 1252(12 to 4), 1253(12 to 5), 1271(8 to 1), 1274(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1242: 3), (1247: 2), (1248: 4), (1249: 2), (1252: 2), (1253: 2), (1271: 1), (1274: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
