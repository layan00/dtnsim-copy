The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
717(1 to 11), 723(3 to 10), 724(4 to 6), 725(7 to 9), 727(12 to 4), 728(12 to 5), 744(8 to 1), 747(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(717: 3), (723: 2), (724: 4), (725: 2), (727: 1), (728: 1), (744: 1), (747: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
