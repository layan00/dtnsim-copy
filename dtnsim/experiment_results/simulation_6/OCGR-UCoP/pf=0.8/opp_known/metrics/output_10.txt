The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(1 to 11), 192(3 to 10), 193(4 to 6), 194(7 to 9), 195(12 to 4), 196(12 to 5), 211(8 to 1), 213(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(193: 55.000000), (213: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 3), (192: 2), (193: 4), (194: 2), (195: 1), (196: 1), (211: 1), (213: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 189: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 192: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000),

Node 5: 
Bundle 193: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 213: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 194: (to: 11, time: 20.000000), (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8:
