The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
449(1 to 11), 453(3 to 10), 454(4 to 6), 455(7 to 9), 458(12 to 4), 459(12 to 5), 476(8 to 1), 478(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(454: 55.000000), (458: 85.000000), (459: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(449: 3), (453: 2), (454: 4), (455: 2), (458: 2), (459: 4), (476: 1), (478: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
