The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
721(1 to 11), 725(3 to 10), 726(4 to 6), 727(7 to 9), 730(12 to 4), 731(12 to 5), 746(8 to 1), 749(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(726: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(721: 3), (725: 4), (726: 3), (727: 2), (730: 1), (731: 1), (746: 1), (749: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 721: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 725: (to: 1, time: 25.000000), (to: 6, time: 50.000000), (to: 1, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 725: (to: 2, time: 20.000000), 
Node 4:
