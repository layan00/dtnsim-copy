The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
705(1 to 11), 710(3 to 10), 711(4 to 6), 712(7 to 9), 715(12 to 4), 716(12 to 5), 732(8 to 1), 737(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(705: 60.000000), (710: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(705: 3), (710: 4), (711: 4), (712: 2), (715: 1), (716: 1), (732: 1), (737: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 705: (to: 13, time: 0.000000),
