The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
193(1 to 11), 198(3 to 10), 199(4 to 6), 200(7 to 9), 206(12 to 4), 207(12 to 5), 222(8 to 1), 230(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(200: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(193: 3), (198: 4), (199: 4), (200: 3), (206: 1), (207: 1), (222: 1), (230: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 65 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
