The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
191(1 to 11), 196(3 to 10), 197(4 to 6), 198(7 to 9), 201(12 to 4), 202(12 to 5), 218(8 to 1), 219(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(196: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 3), (196: 6), (197: 4), (198: 2), (201: 1), (202: 1), (218: 1), (219: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
