The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1222(1 to 11), 1227(3 to 10), 1228(4 to 6), 1229(7 to 9), 1233(12 to 4), 1234(12 to 5), 1249(8 to 1), 1250(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1228: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1222: 3), (1227: 2), (1228: 4), (1229: 3), (1233: 1), (1234: 1), (1249: 1), (1250: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
