The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
960(1 to 11), 965(3 to 10), 966(4 to 6), 967(7 to 9), 969(12 to 4), 970(12 to 5), 987(8 to 1), 995(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(960: 3), (965: 4), (966: 4), (967: 2), (969: 1), (970: 1), (987: 3), (995: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
