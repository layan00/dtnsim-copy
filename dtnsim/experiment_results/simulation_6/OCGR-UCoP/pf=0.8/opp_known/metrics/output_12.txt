The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
717(1 to 11), 722(3 to 10), 723(4 to 6), 724(7 to 9), 726(12 to 4), 727(12 to 5), 742(8 to 1), 745(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(722: 35.000000), (723: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(717: 3), (722: 4), (723: 4), (724: 2), (726: 1), (727: 1), (742: 1), (745: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
