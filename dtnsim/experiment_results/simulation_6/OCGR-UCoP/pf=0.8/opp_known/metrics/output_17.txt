The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
701(1 to 11), 707(3 to 10), 708(4 to 6), 709(7 to 9), 711(12 to 4), 712(12 to 5), 727(8 to 1), 731(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(701: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(701: 3), (707: 4), (708: 4), (709: 2), (711: 1), (712: 1), (727: 1), (731: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 701: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 707: (to: 1, time: 25.000000), (to: 6, time: 50.000000),
