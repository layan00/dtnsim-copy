The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
448(1 to 11), 452(3 to 10), 453(4 to 6), 454(7 to 9), 456(12 to 4), 457(12 to 5), 472(8 to 1), 473(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(448: 3), (452: 2), (453: 4), (454: 2), (456: 2), (457: 2), (472: 1), (473: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
