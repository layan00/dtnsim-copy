The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
302(1 to 11), 308(3 to 10), 309(4 to 6), 310(7 to 9), 321(12 to 4), 322(12 to 5), 326(8 to 1), 333(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(302: 60.000000), (308: 35.000000), (321: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(302: 6), (308: 4), (309: 4), (310: 3), (321: 2), (322: 3), (326: 3), (333: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
