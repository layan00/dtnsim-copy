The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
82(1 to 11), 89(3 to 10), 90(4 to 6), 91(7 to 9), 102(12 to 4), 103(12 to 5), 110(8 to 1), 127(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 60.000000), (90: 55.000000), (91: 25.000000), (103: 15.000000), (110: 15.000000), (127: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(82: 6), (89: 3), (90: 7), (91: 3), (102: 1), (103: 4), (110: 4), (127: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
