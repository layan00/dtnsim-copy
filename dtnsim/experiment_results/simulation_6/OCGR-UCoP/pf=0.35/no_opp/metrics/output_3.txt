The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
474(1 to 11), 480(3 to 10), 481(4 to 6), 482(7 to 9), 488(12 to 4), 489(12 to 5), 494(8 to 1), 500(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(500: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(474: 4), (480: 3), (481: 3), (482: 2), (488: 1), (489: 2), (494: 2), (500: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
