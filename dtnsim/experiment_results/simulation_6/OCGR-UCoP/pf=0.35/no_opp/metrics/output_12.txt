The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
317(1 to 11), 323(3 to 10), 324(4 to 6), 325(7 to 9), 331(12 to 4), 332(12 to 5), 334(8 to 1), 339(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(324: 45.000000), (325: 45.000000), (339: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(317: 3), (323: 3), (324: 3), (325: 3), (331: 1), (332: 1), (334: 1), (339: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
