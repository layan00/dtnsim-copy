The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
74(1 to 11), 79(3 to 10), 80(4 to 6), 81(7 to 9), 91(12 to 4), 92(12 to 5), 96(8 to 1), 108(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(79: 35.000000), (80: 45.000000), (81: 25.000000), (108: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(74: 4), (79: 4), (80: 6), (81: 3), (91: 1), (92: 1), (96: 4), (108: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
