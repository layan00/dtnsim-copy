The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 11), 90(3 to 10), 91(4 to 6), 92(7 to 9), 102(12 to 4), 103(12 to 5), 107(8 to 1), 113(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 4), (90: 3), (91: 4), (92: 3), (102: 1), (103: 1), (107: 1), (113: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
