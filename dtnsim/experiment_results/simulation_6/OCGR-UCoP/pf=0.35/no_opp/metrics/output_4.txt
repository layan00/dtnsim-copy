The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
592(1 to 11), 597(3 to 10), 598(4 to 6), 599(7 to 9), 604(12 to 4), 605(12 to 5), 610(8 to 1), 622(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(597: 35.000000), (598: 45.000000), (599: 45.000000), (604: 85.000000), (610: 15.000000), (622: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(592: 4), (597: 4), (598: 3), (599: 3), (604: 2), (605: 2), (610: 4), (622: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
