The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 11), 202(3 to 10), 203(4 to 6), 204(7 to 9), 214(12 to 4), 215(12 to 5), 221(8 to 1), 226(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 35.000000), (214: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 4), (202: 4), (203: 2), (204: 3), (214: 2), (215: 3), (221: 2), (226: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
