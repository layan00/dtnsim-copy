The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
323(1 to 11), 331(3 to 10), 332(4 to 6), 333(7 to 9), 346(12 to 4), 347(12 to 5), 350(8 to 1), 359(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(331: 25.000000), (359: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(323: 5), (331: 5), (332: 3), (333: 2), (346: 1), (347: 2), (350: 1), (359: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
