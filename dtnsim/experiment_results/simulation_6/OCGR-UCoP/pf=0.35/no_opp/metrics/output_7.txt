The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
340(1 to 11), 342(3 to 10), 343(4 to 6), 344(7 to 9), 351(12 to 4), 352(12 to 5), 357(8 to 1), 370(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(340: 60.000000), (351: 85.000000), (357: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(340: 5), (342: 3), (343: 4), (344: 3), (351: 2), (352: 3), (357: 4), (370: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
