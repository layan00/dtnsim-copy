The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(1 to 11), 200(3 to 10), 201(4 to 6), 202(7 to 9), 208(12 to 4), 209(12 to 5), 213(8 to 1), 230(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 25.000000), (202: 25.000000), (213: 15.000000), (230: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 5), (200: 4), (201: 4), (202: 3), (208: 2), (209: 1), (213: 4), (230: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
