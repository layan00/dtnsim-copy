The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
570(1 to 11), 575(3 to 10), 576(4 to 6), 577(7 to 9), 583(12 to 4), 584(12 to 5), 590(8 to 1), 601(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(575: 35.000000), (576: 45.000000), (577: 45.000000), (583: 85.000000), (601: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(570: 5), (575: 4), (576: 3), (577: 3), (583: 2), (584: 2), (590: 2), (601: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
