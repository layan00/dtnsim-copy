The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
347(1 to 11), 351(3 to 10), 352(4 to 6), 353(7 to 9), 362(12 to 4), 363(12 to 5), 368(8 to 1), 383(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(347: 60.000000), (351: 35.000000), (352: 25.000000), (383: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(347: 5), (351: 4), (352: 4), (353: 3), (362: 1), (363: 1), (368: 4), (383: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
