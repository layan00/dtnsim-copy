The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
75(1 to 11), 80(3 to 10), 81(4 to 6), 82(7 to 9), 92(12 to 4), 93(12 to 5), 100(8 to 1), 108(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 25.000000), (93: 15.000000), (108: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(75: 4), (80: 5), (81: 2), (82: 3), (92: 1), (93: 4), (100: 2), (108: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
