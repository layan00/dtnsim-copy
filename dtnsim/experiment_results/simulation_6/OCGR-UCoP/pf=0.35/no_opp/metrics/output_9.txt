The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
592(1 to 11), 599(3 to 10), 600(4 to 6), 601(7 to 9), 609(12 to 4), 610(12 to 5), 612(8 to 1), 620(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(599: 25.000000), (601: 45.000000), (620: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(592: 5), (599: 5), (600: 2), (601: 3), (609: 1), (610: 1), (612: 1), (620: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
