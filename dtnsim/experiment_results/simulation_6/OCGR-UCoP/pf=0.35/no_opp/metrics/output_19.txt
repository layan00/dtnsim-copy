The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
545(1 to 11), 552(3 to 10), 553(4 to 6), 554(7 to 9), 565(12 to 4), 566(12 to 5), 570(8 to 1), 581(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(553: 55.000000), (554: 25.000000), (566: 15.000000), (581: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(545: 3), (552: 3), (553: 7), (554: 3), (565: 1), (566: 4), (570: 1), (581: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
