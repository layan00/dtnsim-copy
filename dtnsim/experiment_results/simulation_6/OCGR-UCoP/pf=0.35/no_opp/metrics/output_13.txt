The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
441(1 to 11), 450(3 to 10), 451(4 to 6), 452(7 to 9), 466(12 to 4), 467(12 to 5), 473(8 to 1), 484(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(452: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(441: 4), (450: 5), (451: 6), (452: 3), (466: 2), (467: 4), (473: 4), (484: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
