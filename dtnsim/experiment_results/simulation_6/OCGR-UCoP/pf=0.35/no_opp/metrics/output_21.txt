The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(1 to 11), 208(3 to 10), 209(4 to 6), 210(7 to 9), 224(12 to 4), 225(12 to 5), 229(8 to 1), 239(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 35.000000), (210: 25.000000), (225: 15.000000), (239: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 3), (208: 5), (209: 6), (210: 3), (224: 1), (225: 4), (229: 1), (239: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
