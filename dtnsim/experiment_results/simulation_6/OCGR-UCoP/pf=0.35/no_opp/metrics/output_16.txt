The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
187(1 to 11), 191(3 to 10), 192(4 to 6), 193(7 to 9), 198(12 to 4), 199(12 to 5), 204(8 to 1), 211(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(187: 60.000000), (192: 45.000000), (211: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(187: 6), (191: 3), (192: 3), (193: 3), (198: 2), (199: 2), (204: 2), (211: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
