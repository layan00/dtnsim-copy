The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
468(1 to 11), 476(3 to 10), 477(4 to 6), 478(7 to 9), 484(12 to 4), 485(12 to 5), 490(8 to 1), 498(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(468: 60.000000), (476: 35.000000), (484: 85.000000), (498: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(468: 4), (476: 4), (477: 3), (478: 2), (484: 2), (485: 2), (490: 1), (498: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
