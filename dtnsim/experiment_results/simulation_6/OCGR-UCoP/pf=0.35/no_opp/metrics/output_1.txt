The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(1 to 11), 228(3 to 10), 229(4 to 6), 230(7 to 9), 240(12 to 4), 241(12 to 5), 246(8 to 1), 253(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 60.000000), (228: 25.000000), (230: 45.000000), (240: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 5), (228: 5), (229: 2), (230: 3), (240: 2), (241: 2), (246: 1), (253: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
