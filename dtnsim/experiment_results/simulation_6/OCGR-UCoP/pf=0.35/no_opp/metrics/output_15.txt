The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
73(1 to 11), 80(3 to 10), 81(4 to 6), 82(7 to 9), 90(12 to 4), 91(12 to 5), 95(8 to 1), 99(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(73: 60.000000), (80: 25.000000), (81: 45.000000), (90: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(73: 4), (80: 5), (81: 3), (82: 3), (90: 2), (91: 1), (95: 1), (99: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
