The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
577(1 to 11), 582(3 to 10), 583(4 to 6), 584(7 to 9), 589(12 to 4), 590(12 to 5), 596(8 to 1), 607(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(589: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(577: 5), (582: 2), (583: 3), (584: 2), (589: 2), (590: 2), (596: 3), (607: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
