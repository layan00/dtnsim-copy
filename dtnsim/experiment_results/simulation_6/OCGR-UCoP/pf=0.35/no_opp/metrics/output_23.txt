The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
447(1 to 11), 455(3 to 10), 456(4 to 6), 457(7 to 9), 467(12 to 4), 468(12 to 5), 473(8 to 1), 479(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(447: 4), (455: 3), (456: 4), (457: 3), (467: 1), (468: 3), (473: 1), (479: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
