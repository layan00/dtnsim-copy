The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1504(1 to 11), 1521(3 to 10), 1522(4 to 6), 1523(7 to 9), 1528(12 to 4), 1529(12 to 5), 1560(8 to 1), 1566(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1522: 55.000000), (1528: 85.000000), (1566: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1504: 3), (1521: 3), (1522: 5), (1523: 2), (1528: 2), (1529: 4), (1560: 2), (1566: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
