The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1923(1 to 11), 1942(3 to 10), 1943(4 to 6), 1944(7 to 9), 1949(12 to 4), 1950(12 to 5), 1979(8 to 1), 1987(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1923: 60.000000), (1942: 15.000000), (1987: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1923: 3), (1942: 5), (1943: 4), (1944: 3), (1949: 2), (1950: 2), (1979: 1), (1987: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 87 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
