The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1071(1 to 11), 1093(3 to 10), 1094(4 to 6), 1095(7 to 9), 1106(12 to 4), 1107(12 to 5), 1134(8 to 1), 1142(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1093: 25.000000), (1142: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1071: 3), (1093: 5), (1094: 3), (1095: 2), (1106: 1), (1107: 2), (1134: 1), (1142: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
