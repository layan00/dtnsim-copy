The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1519(1 to 11), 1539(3 to 10), 1540(4 to 6), 1541(7 to 9), 1547(12 to 4), 1548(12 to 5), 1577(8 to 1), 1585(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1519: 60.000000), (1539: 35.000000), (1547: 85.000000), (1585: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1519: 3), (1539: 4), (1540: 3), (1541: 2), (1547: 2), (1548: 2), (1577: 1), (1585: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 68 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
