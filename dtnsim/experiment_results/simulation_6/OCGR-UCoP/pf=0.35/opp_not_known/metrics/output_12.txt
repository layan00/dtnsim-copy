The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1066(1 to 11), 1086(3 to 10), 1087(4 to 6), 1088(7 to 9), 1094(12 to 4), 1095(12 to 5), 1123(8 to 1), 1128(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1086: 15.000000), (1087: 45.000000), (1088: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1066: 3), (1086: 5), (1087: 3), (1088: 3), (1094: 1), (1095: 2), (1123: 1), (1128: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 150 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
