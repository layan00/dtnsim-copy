The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1047(1 to 11), 1067(3 to 10), 1068(4 to 6), 1069(7 to 9), 1079(12 to 4), 1080(12 to 5), 1108(8 to 1), 1115(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1047: 60.000000), (1067: 35.000000), (1079: 85.000000), (1115: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1047: 3), (1067: 4), (1068: 4), (1069: 3), (1079: 2), (1080: 3), (1108: 3), (1115: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 123 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
