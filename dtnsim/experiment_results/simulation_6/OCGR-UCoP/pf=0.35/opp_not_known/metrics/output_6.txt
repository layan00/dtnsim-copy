The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
651(1 to 11), 671(3 to 10), 672(4 to 6), 673(7 to 9), 683(12 to 4), 684(12 to 5), 714(8 to 1), 728(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(651: 60.000000), (671: 35.000000), (672: 35.000000), (673: 25.000000), (683: 85.000000), (684: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(651: 3), (671: 4), (672: 6), (673: 3), (683: 2), (684: 4), (714: 1), (728: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
