The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 11), 246(3 to 10), 247(4 to 6), 248(7 to 9), 258(12 to 4), 259(12 to 5), 289(8 to 1), 295(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 15.000000), (295: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 3), (246: 5), (247: 4), (248: 3), (258: 1), (259: 2), (289: 1), (295: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 169 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
