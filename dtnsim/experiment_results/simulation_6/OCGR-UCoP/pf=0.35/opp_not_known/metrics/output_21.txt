The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
648(1 to 11), 668(3 to 10), 669(4 to 6), 670(7 to 9), 684(12 to 4), 685(12 to 5), 713(8 to 1), 723(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(669: 35.000000), (670: 25.000000), (685: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(648: 3), (668: 5), (669: 6), (670: 3), (684: 1), (685: 4), (713: 1), (723: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
