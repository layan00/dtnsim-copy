The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1473(1 to 11), 1492(3 to 10), 1493(4 to 6), 1494(7 to 9), 1499(12 to 4), 1500(12 to 5), 1529(8 to 1), 1536(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1473: 60.000000), (1492: 55.000000), (1499: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1473: 3), (1492: 6), (1493: 5), (1494: 2), (1499: 2), (1500: 2), (1529: 2), (1536: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 144 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
