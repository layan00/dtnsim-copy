The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1096(1 to 11), 1114(3 to 10), 1115(4 to 6), 1116(7 to 9), 1121(12 to 4), 1122(12 to 5), 1151(8 to 1), 1165(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1096: 60.000000), (1114: 35.000000), (1115: 25.000000), (1165: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1096: 3), (1114: 4), (1115: 4), (1116: 2), (1121: 1), (1122: 2), (1151: 4), (1165: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
