The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
645(1 to 11), 663(3 to 10), 664(4 to 6), 665(7 to 9), 668(12 to 4), 669(12 to 5), 697(8 to 1), 713(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(664: 25.000000), (697: 15.000000), (713: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(645: 3), (663: 4), (664: 4), (665: 1), (668: 2), (669: 1), (697: 4), (713: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 106 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
