The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
669(1 to 11), 688(3 to 10), 689(4 to 6), 690(7 to 9), 698(12 to 4), 699(12 to 5), 728(8 to 1), 734(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(669: 60.000000), (688: 25.000000), (689: 55.000000), (690: 45.000000), (698: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(669: 3), (688: 5), (689: 5), (690: 2), (698: 2), (699: 2), (728: 1), (734: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
