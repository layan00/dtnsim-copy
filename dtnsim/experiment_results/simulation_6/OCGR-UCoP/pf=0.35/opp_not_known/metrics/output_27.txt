The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1069(1 to 11), 1089(3 to 10), 1090(4 to 6), 1091(7 to 9), 1096(12 to 4), 1097(12 to 5), 1129(8 to 1), 1142(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1069: 60.000000), (1089: 15.000000), (1090: 25.000000), (1096: 85.000000), (1129: 15.000000), (1142: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1069: 3), (1089: 5), (1090: 4), (1091: 2), (1096: 2), (1097: 2), (1129: 4), (1142: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 69 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
