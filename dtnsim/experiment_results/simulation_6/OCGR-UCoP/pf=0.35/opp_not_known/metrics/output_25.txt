The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
219(1 to 11), 238(3 to 10), 239(4 to 6), 240(7 to 9), 249(12 to 4), 250(12 to 5), 281(8 to 1), 289(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 60.000000), (239: 55.000000), (240: 25.000000), (250: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(219: 3), (238: 5), (239: 5), (240: 3), (249: 1), (250: 4), (281: 2), (289: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 25 calls to RUCoP, which took 145 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
