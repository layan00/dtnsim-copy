The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1495(1 to 11), 1515(3 to 10), 1516(4 to 6), 1517(7 to 9), 1527(12 to 4), 1528(12 to 5), 1557(8 to 1), 1563(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1515: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1495: 3), (1515: 6), (1516: 4), (1517: 3), (1527: 1), (1528: 3), (1557: 1), (1563: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 29 calls to RUCoP, which took 178 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
