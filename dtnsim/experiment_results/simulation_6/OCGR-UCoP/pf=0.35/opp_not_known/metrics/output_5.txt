The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 11), 240(3 to 10), 241(4 to 6), 242(7 to 9), 248(12 to 4), 249(12 to 5), 277(8 to 1), 286(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(240: 55.000000), (242: 25.000000), (248: 85.000000), (286: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 3), (240: 6), (241: 3), (242: 3), (248: 2), (249: 1), (277: 3), (286: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 127 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
