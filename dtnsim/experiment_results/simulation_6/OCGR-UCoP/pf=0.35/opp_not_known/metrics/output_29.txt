The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1927(1 to 11), 1945(3 to 10), 1946(4 to 6), 1947(7 to 9), 1950(12 to 4), 1951(12 to 5), 1981(8 to 1), 1991(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1950: 85.000000), (1991: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1927: 3), (1945: 2), (1946: 3), (1947: 2), (1950: 2), (1951: 2), (1981: 3), (1991: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 95 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
