The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
643(1 to 11), 661(3 to 10), 662(4 to 6), 663(7 to 9), 671(12 to 4), 672(12 to 5), 702(8 to 1), 707(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(643: 60.000000), (661: 35.000000), (662: 55.000000), (671: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(643: 3), (661: 4), (662: 5), (663: 3), (671: 2), (672: 3), (702: 2), (707: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 128 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
