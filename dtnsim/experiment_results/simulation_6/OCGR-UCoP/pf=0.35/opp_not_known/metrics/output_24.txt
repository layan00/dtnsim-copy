The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1920(1 to 11), 1938(3 to 10), 1939(4 to 6), 1940(7 to 9), 1945(12 to 4), 1946(12 to 5), 1976(8 to 1), 1986(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1938: 35.000000), (1939: 45.000000), (1940: 45.000000), (1945: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1920: 3), (1938: 4), (1939: 3), (1940: 3), (1945: 2), (1946: 2), (1976: 2), (1986: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 114 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
