The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
226(1 to 11), 247(3 to 10), 248(4 to 6), 249(7 to 9), 260(12 to 4), 261(12 to 5), 293(8 to 1), 309(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(226: 60.000000), (247: 15.000000), (248: 55.000000), (249: 25.000000), (261: 15.000000), (293: 15.000000), (309: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(226: 3), (247: 5), (248: 7), (249: 3), (260: 1), (261: 4), (293: 4), (309: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 87 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
