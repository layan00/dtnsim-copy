The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
630(1 to 11), 648(3 to 10), 649(4 to 6), 650(7 to 9), 654(12 to 4), 655(12 to 5), 684(8 to 1), 691(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(630: 60.000000), (648: 55.000000), (649: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(630: 3), (648: 6), (649: 3), (650: 3), (654: 2), (655: 2), (684: 2), (691: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 126 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
