The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1522(1 to 11), 1540(3 to 10), 1541(4 to 6), 1542(7 to 9), 1548(12 to 4), 1549(12 to 5), 1578(8 to 1), 1584(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1540: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1522: 3), (1540: 6), (1541: 3), (1542: 2), (1548: 1), (1549: 2), (1578: 2), (1584: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 150 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
