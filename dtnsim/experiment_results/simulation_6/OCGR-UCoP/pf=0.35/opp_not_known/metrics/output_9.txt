The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1943(1 to 11), 1963(3 to 10), 1964(4 to 6), 1965(7 to 9), 1972(12 to 4), 1973(12 to 5), 1999(8 to 1), 2006(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1963: 25.000000), (1965: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1943: 3), (1963: 5), (1964: 5), (1965: 3), (1972: 1), (1973: 2), (1999: 1), (2006: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 153 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
