The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1897(1 to 11), 1918(3 to 10), 1919(4 to 6), 1920(7 to 9), 1931(12 to 4), 1932(12 to 5), 1962(8 to 1), 1973(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1918: 15.000000), (1919: 55.000000), (1920: 25.000000), (1932: 15.000000), (1973: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1897: 3), (1918: 5), (1919: 7), (1920: 3), (1931: 1), (1932: 4), (1962: 1), (1973: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
