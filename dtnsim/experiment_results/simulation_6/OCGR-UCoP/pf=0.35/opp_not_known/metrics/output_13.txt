The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1494(1 to 11), 1515(3 to 10), 1516(4 to 6), 1517(7 to 9), 1531(12 to 4), 1532(12 to 5), 1562(8 to 1), 1573(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1517: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1494: 3), (1515: 5), (1516: 6), (1517: 3), (1531: 2), (1532: 4), (1562: 4), (1573: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 114 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
