The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1942(1 to 11), 1961(3 to 10), 1962(4 to 6), 1963(7 to 9), 1967(12 to 4), 1968(12 to 5), 1997(8 to 1), 2009(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1942: 60.000000), (1961: 35.000000), (1962: 45.000000), (1963: 45.000000), (1967: 85.000000), (1997: 15.000000), (2009: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1942: 3), (1961: 4), (1962: 3), (1963: 3), (1967: 2), (1968: 2), (1997: 4), (2009: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 48 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
