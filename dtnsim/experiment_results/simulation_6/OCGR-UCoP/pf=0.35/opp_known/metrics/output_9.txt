The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1481(1 to 11), 1489(3 to 10), 1490(4 to 6), 1491(7 to 9), 1496(12 to 4), 1497(12 to 5), 1515(8 to 1), 1521(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1489: 15.000000), (1491: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1481: 3), (1489: 4), (1490: 2), (1491: 3), (1496: 2), (1497: 2), (1515: 1), (1521: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
