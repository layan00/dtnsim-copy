The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
512(1 to 11), 518(3 to 10), 519(4 to 6), 520(7 to 9), 528(12 to 4), 529(12 to 5), 555(8 to 1), 562(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(512: 60.000000), (518: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(512: 3), (518: 4), (519: 2), (520: 3), (528: 5), (529: 5), (555: 4), (562: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
