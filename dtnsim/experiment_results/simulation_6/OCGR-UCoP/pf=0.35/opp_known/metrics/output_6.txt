The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
529(1 to 11), 537(3 to 10), 538(4 to 6), 539(7 to 9), 546(12 to 4), 547(12 to 5), 575(8 to 1), 585(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(529: 60.000000), (537: 35.000000), (539: 25.000000), (546: 85.000000), (547: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(529: 3), (537: 4), (538: 2), (539: 3), (546: 8), (547: 6), (575: 1), (585: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
