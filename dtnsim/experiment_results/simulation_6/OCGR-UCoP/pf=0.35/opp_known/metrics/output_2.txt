The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
856(1 to 11), 862(3 to 10), 863(4 to 6), 864(7 to 9), 871(12 to 4), 872(12 to 5), 891(8 to 1), 902(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(856: 60.000000), (862: 35.000000), (891: 35.000000), (902: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(856: 3), (862: 4), (863: 2), (864: 3), (871: 2), (872: 2), (891: 7), (902: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
