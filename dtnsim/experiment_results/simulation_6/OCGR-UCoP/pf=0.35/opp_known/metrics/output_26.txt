The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
525(1 to 11), 531(3 to 10), 532(4 to 6), 533(7 to 9), 538(12 to 4), 539(12 to 5), 557(8 to 1), 571(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(533: 25.000000), (571: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(525: 3), (531: 4), (532: 2), (533: 3), (538: 3), (539: 3), (557: 5), (571: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
