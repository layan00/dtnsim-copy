The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
538(1 to 11), 545(3 to 10), 546(4 to 6), 547(7 to 9), 553(12 to 4), 554(12 to 5), 578(8 to 1), 583(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(538: 60.000000), (545: 15.000000), (547: 45.000000), (553: 85.000000), (554: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(538: 3), (545: 4), (546: 2), (547: 3), (553: 9), (554: 11), (578: 1), (583: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
