The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(1 to 11), 212(3 to 10), 213(4 to 6), 214(7 to 9), 219(12 to 4), 220(12 to 5), 240(8 to 1), 243(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(205: 60.000000), (212: 15.000000), (219: 85.000000), (220: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 3), (212: 4), (213: 2), (214: 3), (219: 3), (220: 5), (240: 1), (243: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
