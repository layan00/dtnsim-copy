The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
820(1 to 11), 828(3 to 10), 829(4 to 6), 830(7 to 9), 835(12 to 4), 836(12 to 5), 854(8 to 1), 859(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(828: 15.000000), (830: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(820: 3), (828: 4), (829: 2), (830: 3), (835: 2), (836: 2), (854: 1), (859: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
