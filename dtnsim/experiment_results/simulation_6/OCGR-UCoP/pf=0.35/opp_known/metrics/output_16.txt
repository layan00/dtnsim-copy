The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
501(1 to 11), 507(3 to 10), 508(4 to 6), 509(7 to 9), 512(12 to 4), 513(12 to 5), 535(8 to 1), 544(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(501: 60.000000), (507: 55.000000), (535: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(501: 3), (507: 6), (508: 2), (509: 3), (512: 9), (513: 9), (535: 7), (544: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
