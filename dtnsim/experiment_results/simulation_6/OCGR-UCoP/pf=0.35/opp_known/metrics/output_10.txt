The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 11), 212(3 to 10), 213(4 to 6), 214(7 to 9), 220(12 to 4), 221(12 to 5), 239(8 to 1), 250(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 60.000000), (212: 35.000000), (214: 25.000000), (239: 35.000000), (250: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 3), (212: 4), (213: 2), (214: 3), (220: 2), (221: 2), (239: 7), (250: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
