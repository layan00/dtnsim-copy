The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 11), 223(3 to 10), 224(4 to 6), 225(7 to 9), 233(12 to 4), 234(12 to 5), 264(8 to 1), 276(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 60.000000), (223: 15.000000), (225: 25.000000), (276: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 3), (223: 4), (224: 2), (225: 3), (233: 6), (234: 6), (264: 4), (276: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 65 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
