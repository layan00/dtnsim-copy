The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
207(1 to 11), 214(3 to 10), 215(4 to 6), 216(7 to 9), 224(12 to 4), 225(12 to 5), 256(8 to 1), 264(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 60.000000), (214: 15.000000), (216: 25.000000), (224: 85.000000), (225: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(207: 3), (214: 4), (215: 2), (216: 3), (224: 8), (225: 6), (256: 4), (264: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
