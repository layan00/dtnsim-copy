The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
515(1 to 11), 523(3 to 10), 524(4 to 6), 525(7 to 9), 534(12 to 4), 535(12 to 5), 561(8 to 1), 567(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(523: 15.000000), (525: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(515: 3), (523: 4), (524: 2), (525: 3), (534: 5), (535: 5), (561: 1), (567: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
