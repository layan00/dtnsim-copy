The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1166(1 to 11), 1172(3 to 10), 1173(4 to 6), 1174(7 to 9), 1179(12 to 4), 1180(12 to 5), 1200(8 to 1), 1208(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1172: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1166: 3), (1172: 6), (1173: 2), (1174: 2), (1179: 3), (1180: 3), (1200: 4), (1208: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
