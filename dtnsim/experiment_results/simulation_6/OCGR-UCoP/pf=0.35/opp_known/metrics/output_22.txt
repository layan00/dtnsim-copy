The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
818(1 to 11), 828(3 to 10), 829(4 to 6), 830(7 to 9), 837(12 to 4), 838(12 to 5), 858(8 to 1), 865(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(828: 15.000000), (865: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(818: 3), (828: 4), (829: 2), (830: 2), (837: 3), (838: 3), (858: 1), (865: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
