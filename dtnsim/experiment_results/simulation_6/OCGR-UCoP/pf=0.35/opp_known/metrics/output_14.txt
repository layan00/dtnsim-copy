The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1445(1 to 11), 1452(3 to 10), 1453(4 to 6), 1454(7 to 9), 1459(12 to 4), 1460(12 to 5), 1479(8 to 1), 1485(9 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1445: 60.000000), (1452: 15.000000), (1485: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1445: 3), (1452: 4), (1453: 2), (1454: 3), (1459: 3), (1460: 3), (1479: 1), (1485: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
