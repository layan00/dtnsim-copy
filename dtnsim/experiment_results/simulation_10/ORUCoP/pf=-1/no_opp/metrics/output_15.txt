The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
109(1 to 6), 110(6 to 10), 111(9 to 4), 121(2 to 8), 136(5 to 12), 144(7 to 12), 145(10 to 9), 154(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(109: 80.000000), (111: 140.000000), (121: 125.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(109: 8), (110: 4), (111: 7), (121: 8), (136: 6), (144: 2), (145: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
