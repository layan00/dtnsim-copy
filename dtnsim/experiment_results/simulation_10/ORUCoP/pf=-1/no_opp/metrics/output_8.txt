The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
776(1 to 6), 777(6 to 10), 778(9 to 4), 784(2 to 8), 793(5 to 12), 805(7 to 12), 806(10 to 9), 815(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(777: 160.000000), (778: 140.000000), (784: 0.000000), (793: 95.000000), (805: 80.000000), (806: 100.000000), (815: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(776: 1), (777: 9), (778: 7), (784: 2), (793: 6), (805: 6), (806: 7), (815: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
