The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
477(1 to 6), 478(6 to 10), 479(9 to 4), 485(2 to 8), 494(5 to 12), 502(7 to 12), 503(10 to 9), 512(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(485: 25.000000), (494: 95.000000), (502: 80.000000), (503: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(478: 7), (479: 6), (485: 6), (494: 6), (502: 6), (503: 7), (512: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
