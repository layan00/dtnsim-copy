The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
319(1 to 6), 320(6 to 10), 321(9 to 4), 327(2 to 8), 341(5 to 12), 351(7 to 12), 352(10 to 9), 364(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(319: 80.000000), (327: 0.000000), (341: 95.000000), (351: 80.000000), (352: 40.000000), (364: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(319: 4), (320: 7), (321: 5), (327: 6), (341: 10), (351: 12), (352: 8), (364: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
