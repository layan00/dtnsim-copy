The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
572(1 to 6), 573(6 to 10), 574(9 to 4), 586(2 to 8), 595(5 to 12), 603(7 to 12), 604(10 to 9), 611(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(573: 160.000000), (574: 140.000000), (586: 25.000000), (595: 95.000000), (603: 80.000000), (604: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 2), (573: 9), (574: 11), (586: 2), (595: 10), (603: 6), (604: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
