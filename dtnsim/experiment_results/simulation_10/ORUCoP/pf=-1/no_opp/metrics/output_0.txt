The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
121(1 to 6), 122(6 to 10), 123(9 to 4), 139(2 to 8), 152(5 to 12), 163(7 to 12), 164(10 to 9), 177(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(121: 80.000000), (122: 160.000000), (123: 40.000000), (139: 0.000000), (152: 95.000000), (163: 80.000000), (164: 100.000000), (177: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(121: 12), (122: 9), (123: 9), (139: 6), (152: 10), (163: 6), (164: 10), (177: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 77 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
