The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
352(1 to 6), 353(6 to 10), 354(9 to 4), 364(2 to 8), 377(5 to 12), 387(7 to 12), 388(10 to 9), 401(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(352: 80.000000), (354: 40.000000), (364: 125.000000), (388: 40.000000), (401: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(352: 12), (353: 4), (354: 7), (364: 14), (377: 6), (387: 2), (388: 8), (401: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
