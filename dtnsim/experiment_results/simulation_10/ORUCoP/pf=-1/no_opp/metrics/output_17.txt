The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
503(1 to 6), 504(6 to 10), 505(9 to 4), 516(2 to 8), 526(5 to 12), 537(7 to 12), 538(10 to 9), 547(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(505: 40.000000), (516: 0.000000), (538: 40.000000), (547: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(503: 2), (504: 3), (505: 9), (516: 2), (526: 5), (537: 1), (538: 8), (547: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
