The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1010(1 to 6), 1011(6 to 10), 1012(9 to 4), 1024(2 to 8), 1039(5 to 12), 1052(7 to 12), 1053(10 to 9), 1070(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1010: 80.000000), (1012: 40.000000), (1024: 0.000000), (1039: 95.000000), (1052: 80.000000), (1053: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1010: 9), (1011: 5), (1012: 9), (1024: 4), (1039: 7), (1052: 9), (1053: 8), (1070: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
