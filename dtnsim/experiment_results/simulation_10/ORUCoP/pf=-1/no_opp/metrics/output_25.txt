The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
115(1 to 6), 116(6 to 10), 117(9 to 4), 129(2 to 8), 144(5 to 12), 156(7 to 12), 157(10 to 9), 171(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(115: 120.000000), (117: 40.000000), (129: 0.000000), (144: 95.000000), (156: 80.000000), (157: 40.000000), (171: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(115: 8), (116: 7), (117: 9), (129: 6), (144: 4), (156: 6), (157: 6), (171: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
