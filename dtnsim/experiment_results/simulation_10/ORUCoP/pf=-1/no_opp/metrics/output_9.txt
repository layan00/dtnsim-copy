The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
978(1 to 6), 979(6 to 10), 980(9 to 4), 986(2 to 8), 997(5 to 12), 1009(7 to 12), 1010(10 to 9), 1022(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(986: 0.000000), (1010: 40.000000), (1022: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(979: 7), (980: 6), (986: 6), (1009: 6), (1010: 4), (1022: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
