The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
105(1 to 6), 106(6 to 10), 107(9 to 4), 114(2 to 8), 125(5 to 12), 136(7 to 12), 137(10 to 9), 148(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(107: 140.000000), (114: 25.000000), (125: 95.000000), (136: 80.000000), (137: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(105: 2), (106: 8), (107: 8), (114: 3), (125: 6), (136: 12), (137: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
