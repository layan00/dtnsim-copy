The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
929(1 to 6), 930(6 to 10), 931(9 to 4), 941(2 to 8), 956(5 to 12), 968(7 to 12), 969(10 to 9), 986(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(929: 80.000000), (930: 160.000000), (931: 40.000000), (941: 125.000000), (956: 95.000000), (969: 40.000000), (986: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(929: 11), (930: 9), (931: 7), (941: 14), (956: 10), (968: 4), (969: 8), (986: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
