The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1829(1 to 6), 1830(6 to 10), 1831(9 to 4), 1857(2 to 8), 1877(5 to 12), 1912(7 to 12), 1913(10 to 9), 1927(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1829: 80.000000), (1830: 120.000000), (1831: 0.000000), (1857: 0.000000), (1913: 40.000000), (1927: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1829: 10), (1830: 16), (1831: 6), (1857: 4), (1877: 6), (1912: 3), (1913: 8), (1927: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 198 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
