The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1843(1 to 6), 1844(6 to 10), 1845(9 to 4), 1863(2 to 8), 1884(5 to 12), 1921(7 to 12), 1922(10 to 9), 1936(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1843: 80.000000), (1844: 160.000000), (1845: 0.000000), (1863: 0.000000), (1884: 95.000000), (1921: 40.000000), (1922: 80.000000), (1936: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1843: 10), (1844: 12), (1845: 6), (1863: 4), (1884: 8), (1921: 8), (1922: 8), (1936: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 191 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
