The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
777(1 to 6), 778(6 to 10), 779(9 to 4), 803(2 to 8), 825(5 to 12), 863(7 to 12), 864(10 to 9), 887(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(778: 160.000000), (779: 80.000000), (803: 0.000000), (825: 95.000000), (863: 40.000000), (864: 40.000000), (887: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(777: 6), (778: 24), (779: 6), (803: 4), (825: 7), (863: 10), (864: 11), (887: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 214 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
