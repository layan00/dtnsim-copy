The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1776(1 to 6), 1777(6 to 10), 1778(9 to 4), 1804(2 to 8), 1826(5 to 12), 1862(7 to 12), 1863(10 to 9), 1885(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1777: 160.000000), (1778: 0.000000), (1804: 0.000000), (1826: 95.000000), (1862: 40.000000), (1863: 100.000000), (1885: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1776: 6), (1777: 28), (1778: 6), (1804: 4), (1826: 10), (1862: 8), (1863: 11), (1885: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 138 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
