The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1822(1 to 6), 1823(6 to 10), 1824(9 to 4), 1850(2 to 8), 1870(5 to 12), 1905(7 to 12), 1906(10 to 9), 1934(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1822: 80.000000), (1823: 160.000000), (1824: 0.000000), (1850: 0.000000), (1870: 95.000000), (1905: 40.000000), (1906: 100.000000), (1934: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1822: 14), (1823: 27), (1824: 6), (1850: 4), (1870: 10), (1905: 11), (1906: 7), (1934: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 231 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
