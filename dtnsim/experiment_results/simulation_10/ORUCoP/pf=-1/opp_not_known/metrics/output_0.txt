The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
257(1 to 6), 258(6 to 10), 259(9 to 4), 285(2 to 8), 308(5 to 12), 343(7 to 12), 344(10 to 9), 363(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(257: 80.000000), (258: 80.000000), (259: 0.000000), (285: 0.000000), (308: 95.000000), (343: 40.000000), (344: 100.000000), (363: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(257: 10), (258: 17), (259: 6), (285: 4), (308: 11), (343: 14), (344: 7), (363: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 155 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
