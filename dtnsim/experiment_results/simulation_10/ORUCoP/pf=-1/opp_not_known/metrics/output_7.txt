The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1315(1 to 6), 1316(6 to 10), 1317(9 to 4), 1335(2 to 8), 1361(5 to 12), 1396(7 to 12), 1397(10 to 9), 1412(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1315: 40.000000), (1316: 160.000000), (1317: 0.000000), (1335: 0.000000), (1361: 95.000000), (1396: 80.000000), (1397: 40.000000), (1412: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1315: 4), (1316: 16), (1317: 6), (1335: 4), (1361: 10), (1396: 12), (1397: 7), (1412: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
