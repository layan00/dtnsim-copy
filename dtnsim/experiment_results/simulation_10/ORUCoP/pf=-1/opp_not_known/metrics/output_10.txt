The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
241(1 to 6), 242(6 to 10), 243(9 to 4), 263(2 to 8), 282(5 to 12), 318(7 to 12), 319(10 to 9), 337(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 160.000000), (243: 0.000000), (263: 25.000000), (282: 95.000000), (318: 40.000000), (319: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(241: 6), (242: 20), (243: 6), (263: 4), (282: 8), (318: 10), (319: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 128 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
