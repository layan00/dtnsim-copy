The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
257(1 to 6), 258(6 to 10), 259(9 to 4), 285(2 to 8), 306(5 to 12), 341(7 to 12), 342(10 to 9), 366(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(258: 160.000000), (259: 0.000000), (285: 0.000000), (341: 40.000000), (342: 120.000000), (366: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(257: 6), (258: 24), (259: 6), (285: 4), (306: 10), (341: 16), (342: 10), (366: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 236 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
