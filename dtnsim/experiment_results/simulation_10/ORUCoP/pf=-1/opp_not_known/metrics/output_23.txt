The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1827(1 to 6), 1828(6 to 10), 1829(9 to 4), 1853(2 to 8), 1872(5 to 12), 1908(7 to 12), 1909(10 to 9), 1925(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1828: 100.000000), (1829: 80.000000), (1853: 0.000000), (1872: 95.000000), (1908: 80.000000), (1909: 40.000000), (1925: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1827: 6), (1828: 18), (1829: 9), (1853: 4), (1872: 7), (1908: 10), (1909: 11), (1925: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 226 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
