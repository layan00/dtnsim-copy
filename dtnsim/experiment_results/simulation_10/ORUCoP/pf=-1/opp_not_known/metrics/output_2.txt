The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1309(1 to 6), 1310(6 to 10), 1311(9 to 4), 1337(2 to 8), 1356(5 to 12), 1389(7 to 12), 1390(10 to 9), 1405(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1309: 80.000000), (1310: 80.000000), (1311: 0.000000), (1337: 25.000000), (1356: 95.000000), (1389: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1309: 10), (1310: 17), (1311: 6), (1337: 4), (1356: 10), (1389: 8), (1390: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 142 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
