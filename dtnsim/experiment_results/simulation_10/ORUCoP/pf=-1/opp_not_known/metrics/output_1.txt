The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
786(1 to 6), 787(6 to 10), 788(9 to 4), 810(2 to 8), 832(5 to 12), 866(7 to 12), 867(10 to 9), 887(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(786: 80.000000), (787: 40.000000), (788: 0.000000), (810: 40.000000), (866: 40.000000), (867: 40.000000), (887: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(786: 12), (787: 14), (788: 6), (810: 9), (832: 6), (866: 7), (867: 10), (887: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 149 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
