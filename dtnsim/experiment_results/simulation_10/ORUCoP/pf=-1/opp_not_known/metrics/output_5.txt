The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(1 to 6), 248(6 to 10), 249(9 to 4), 275(2 to 8), 295(5 to 12), 332(7 to 12), 333(10 to 9), 358(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 80.000000), (248: 160.000000), (249: 0.000000), (275: 0.000000), (333: 40.000000), (358: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 9), (248: 23), (249: 6), (275: 4), (295: 7), (332: 9), (333: 11), (358: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 216 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
