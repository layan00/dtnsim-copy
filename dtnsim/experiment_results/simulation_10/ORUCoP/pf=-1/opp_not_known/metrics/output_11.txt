The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
738(1 to 6), 739(6 to 10), 740(9 to 4), 758(2 to 8), 778(5 to 12), 810(7 to 12), 811(10 to 9), 825(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(738: 40.000000), (740: 0.000000), (778: 95.000000), (810: 80.000000), (825: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(738: 4), (739: 11), (740: 6), (758: 4), (778: 10), (810: 8), (811: 12), (825: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
