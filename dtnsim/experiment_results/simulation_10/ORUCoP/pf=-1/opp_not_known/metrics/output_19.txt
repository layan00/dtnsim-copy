The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2313(1 to 6), 2314(6 to 10), 2315(9 to 4), 2331(2 to 8), 2358(5 to 12), 2392(7 to 12), 2393(10 to 9), 2411(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2313: 40.000000), (2314: 160.000000), (2315: 80.000000), (2331: 0.000000), (2358: 95.000000), (2392: 40.000000), (2393: 40.000000), (2411: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2313: 4), (2314: 16), (2315: 9), (2331: 4), (2358: 10), (2392: 11), (2393: 7), (2411: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 173 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
