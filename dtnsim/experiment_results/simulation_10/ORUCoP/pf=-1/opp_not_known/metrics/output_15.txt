The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(1 to 6), 246(6 to 10), 247(9 to 4), 269(2 to 8), 293(5 to 12), 326(7 to 12), 327(10 to 9), 336(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(245: 80.000000), (246: 40.000000), (247: 0.000000), (269: 40.000000), (336: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 8), (246: 14), (247: 6), (269: 6), (293: 6), (326: 4), (327: 2), (336: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 147 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
