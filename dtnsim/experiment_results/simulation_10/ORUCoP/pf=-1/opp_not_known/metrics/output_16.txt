The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
740(1 to 6), 741(6 to 10), 742(9 to 4), 760(2 to 8), 782(5 to 12), 817(7 to 12), 818(10 to 9), 837(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(740: 80.000000), (741: 160.000000), (742: 0.000000), (760: 0.000000), (782: 95.000000), (817: 80.000000), (818: 40.000000), (837: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(740: 9), (741: 12), (742: 6), (760: 4), (782: 7), (817: 12), (818: 11), (837: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
