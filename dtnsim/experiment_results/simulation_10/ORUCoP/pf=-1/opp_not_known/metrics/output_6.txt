The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
780(1 to 6), 781(6 to 10), 782(9 to 4), 800(2 to 8), 824(5 to 12), 858(7 to 12), 859(10 to 9), 879(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(780: 80.000000), (781: 160.000000), (782: 0.000000), (800: 0.000000), (824: 95.000000), (858: 40.000000), (859: 40.000000), (879: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(780: 9), (781: 11), (782: 6), (800: 4), (824: 10), (858: 11), (859: 11), (879: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 167 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
