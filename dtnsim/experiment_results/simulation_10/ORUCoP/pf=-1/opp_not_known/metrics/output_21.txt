The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
793(1 to 6), 794(6 to 10), 795(9 to 4), 813(2 to 8), 839(5 to 12), 876(7 to 12), 877(10 to 9), 896(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(793: 40.000000), (794: 160.000000), (795: 0.000000), (813: 0.000000), (839: 95.000000), (876: 40.000000), (877: 40.000000), (896: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(793: 4), (794: 15), (795: 6), (813: 4), (839: 5), (876: 10), (877: 9), (896: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 157 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
