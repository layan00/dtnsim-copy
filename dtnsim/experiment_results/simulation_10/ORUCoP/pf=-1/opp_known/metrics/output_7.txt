The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1091(1 to 6), 1092(6 to 10), 1093(9 to 4), 1107(2 to 8), 1121(5 to 12), 1143(7 to 12), 1144(10 to 9), 1159(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1091: 40.000000), (1092: 120.000000), (1093: 0.000000), (1107: 125.000000), (1121: 95.000000), (1143: 80.000000), (1144: 40.000000), (1159: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1091: 5), (1092: 12), (1093: 6), (1107: 7), (1121: 15), (1143: 16), (1144: 7), (1159: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
