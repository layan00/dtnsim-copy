The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
241(1 to 6), 242(6 to 10), 243(9 to 4), 258(2 to 8), 273(5 to 12), 293(7 to 12), 294(10 to 9), 309(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 40.000000), (242: 80.000000), (243: 0.000000), (258: 25.000000), (273: 95.000000), (293: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(241: 5), (242: 12), (243: 6), (258: 6), (273: 13), (293: 10), (294: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
