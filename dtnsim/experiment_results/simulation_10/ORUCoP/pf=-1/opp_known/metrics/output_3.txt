The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1496(1 to 6), 1497(6 to 10), 1498(9 to 4), 1516(2 to 8), 1525(5 to 12), 1547(7 to 12), 1548(10 to 9), 1560(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1496: 40.000000), (1497: 80.000000), (1498: 0.000000), (1525: 95.000000), (1547: 80.000000), (1548: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1496: 7), (1497: 12), (1498: 6), (1525: 14), (1547: 10), (1548: 7), (1560: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
