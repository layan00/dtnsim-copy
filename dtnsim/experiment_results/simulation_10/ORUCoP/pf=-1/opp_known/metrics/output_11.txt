The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
644(1 to 6), 645(6 to 10), 646(9 to 4), 660(2 to 8), 670(5 to 12), 689(7 to 12), 690(10 to 9), 701(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(644: 40.000000), (646: 0.000000), (670: 95.000000), (689: 80.000000), (690: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(644: 5), (645: 6), (646: 6), (670: 4), (689: 9), (690: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
