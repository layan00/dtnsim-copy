The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1036(1 to 6), 1037(6 to 10), 1038(9 to 4), 1054(2 to 8), 1066(5 to 12), 1089(7 to 12), 1090(10 to 9), 1105(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1036: 40.000000), (1037: 80.000000), (1038: 80.000000), (1066: 95.000000), (1089: 80.000000), (1090: 40.000000), (1105: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1036: 9), (1037: 12), (1038: 9), (1066: 13), (1089: 16), (1090: 11), (1105: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
