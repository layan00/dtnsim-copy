The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
633(1 to 6), 634(6 to 10), 635(9 to 4), 653(2 to 8), 665(5 to 12), 687(7 to 12), 688(10 to 9), 701(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(633: 80.000000), (634: 80.000000), (635: 0.000000), (653: 125.000000), (687: 80.000000), (688: 40.000000), (701: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(633: 9), (634: 12), (635: 6), (653: 7), (665: 8), (687: 8), (688: 11), (701: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
