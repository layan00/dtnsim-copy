The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1875(1 to 6), 1876(6 to 10), 1877(9 to 4), 1889(2 to 8), 1904(5 to 12), 1925(7 to 12), 1926(10 to 9), 1943(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1875: 40.000000), (1876: 80.000000), (1877: 80.000000), (1889: 25.000000), (1904: 95.000000), (1925: 120.000000), (1943: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1875: 5), (1876: 12), (1877: 9), (1889: 10), (1904: 14), (1925: 12), (1926: 4), (1943: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
