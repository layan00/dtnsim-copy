The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
243(1 to 6), 244(6 to 10), 245(9 to 4), 263(2 to 8), 274(5 to 12), 298(7 to 12), 299(10 to 9), 314(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 40.000000), (244: 160.000000), (245: 0.000000), (298: 80.000000), (299: 40.000000), (314: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 9), (244: 10), (245: 6), (274: 3), (298: 16), (299: 8), (314: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
