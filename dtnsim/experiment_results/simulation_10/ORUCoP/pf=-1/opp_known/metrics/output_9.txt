The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1921(1 to 6), 1922(6 to 10), 1923(9 to 4), 1937(2 to 8), 1950(5 to 12), 1974(7 to 12), 1975(10 to 9), 2002(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1921: 40.000000), (1922: 120.000000), (1923: 0.000000), (1937: 25.000000), (1974: 80.000000), (1975: 40.000000), (2002: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1921: 5), (1922: 12), (1923: 6), (1937: 10), (1974: 9), (1975: 14), (2002: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
