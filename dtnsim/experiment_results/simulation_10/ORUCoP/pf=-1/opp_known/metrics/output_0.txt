The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
253(1 to 6), 254(6 to 10), 255(9 to 4), 273(2 to 8), 291(5 to 12), 314(7 to 12), 315(10 to 9), 332(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 40.000000), (254: 120.000000), (255: 0.000000), (273: 0.000000), (291: 95.000000), (314: 0.000000), (315: 40.000000), (332: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 9), (254: 12), (255: 6), (273: 4), (291: 14), (314: 10), (315: 7), (332: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 651 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
