The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1440(1 to 6), 1441(6 to 10), 1442(9 to 4), 1457(2 to 8), 1470(5 to 12), 1495(7 to 12), 1496(10 to 9), 1523(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1440: 40.000000), (1441: 80.000000), (1442: 0.000000), (1457: 25.000000), (1470: 95.000000), (1495: 80.000000), (1496: 100.000000), (1523: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1440: 6), (1441: 12), (1442: 6), (1457: 10), (1470: 14), (1495: 8), (1496: 14), (1523: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
