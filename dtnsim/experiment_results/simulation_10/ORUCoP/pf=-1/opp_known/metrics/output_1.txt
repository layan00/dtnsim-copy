The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
668(1 to 6), 669(6 to 10), 670(9 to 4), 685(2 to 8), 698(5 to 12), 720(7 to 12), 721(10 to 9), 746(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(668: 40.000000), (669: 120.000000), (670: 0.000000), (685: 25.000000), (698: 95.000000), (720: 80.000000), (721: 40.000000), (746: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(668: 6), (669: 12), (670: 6), (685: 10), (698: 13), (720: 16), (721: 14), (746: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
