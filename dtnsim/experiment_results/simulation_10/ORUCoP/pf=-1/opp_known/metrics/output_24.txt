The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1945(1 to 6), 1946(6 to 10), 1947(9 to 4), 1965(2 to 8), 1981(5 to 12), 2006(7 to 12), 2007(10 to 9), 2033(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1945: 40.000000), (1946: 80.000000), (1947: 0.000000), (1965: 25.000000), (1981: 95.000000), (2006: 80.000000), (2007: 40.000000), (2033: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1945: 9), (1946: 12), (1947: 6), (1965: 10), (1981: 12), (2006: 11), (2007: 14), (2033: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
