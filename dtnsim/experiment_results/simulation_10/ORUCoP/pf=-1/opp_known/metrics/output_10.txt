The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(1 to 6), 238(6 to 10), 239(9 to 4), 257(2 to 8), 268(5 to 12), 291(7 to 12), 292(10 to 9), 316(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(237: 80.000000), (238: 120.000000), (239: 0.000000), (257: 25.000000), (268: 95.000000), (291: 80.000000), (292: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 8), (238: 12), (239: 6), (257: 6), (268: 15), (291: 16), (292: 14), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
