The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
265(1 to 6), 266(6 to 10), 267(9 to 4), 279(2 to 8), 300(5 to 12), 333(7 to 12), 334(10 to 9), 343(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(265: 40.000000), (266: 0.000000), (267: 0.000000), (279: 0.000000), (300: 95.000000), (333: 0.000000), (334: 100.000000), (343: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(265: 3), (266: 8), (267: 3), (279: 2), (300: 4), (333: 6), (334: 5), (343: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
