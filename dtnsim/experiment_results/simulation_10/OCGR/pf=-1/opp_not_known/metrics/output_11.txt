The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
742(1 to 6), 743(6 to 10), 744(9 to 4), 752(2 to 8), 768(5 to 12), 798(7 to 12), 799(10 to 9), 804(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(742: 40.000000), (744: 0.000000), (768: 95.000000), (804: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(742: 3), (743: 7), (744: 3), (752: 2), (768: 4), (798: 3), (799: 2), (804: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
