The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1215(1 to 6), 1216(6 to 10), 1217(9 to 4), 1224(2 to 8), 1241(5 to 12), 1272(7 to 12), 1273(10 to 9), 1279(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1216: 160.000000), (1217: 0.000000), (1224: 25.000000), (1273: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1215: 1), (1216: 12), (1217: 3), (1224: 3), (1241: 7), (1272: 4), (1273: 4), (1279: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
