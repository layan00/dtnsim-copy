The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1249(1 to 6), 1250(6 to 10), 1251(9 to 4), 1258(2 to 8), 1276(5 to 12), 1309(7 to 12), 1310(10 to 9), 1320(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1249: 120.000000), (1250: 160.000000), (1251: 60.000000), (1258: 0.000000), (1276: 95.000000), (1309: 0.000000), (1310: 40.000000), (1320: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1249: 5), (1250: 12), (1251: 5), (1258: 2), (1276: 5), (1309: 6), (1310: 4), (1320: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
