The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
737(1 to 6), 738(6 to 10), 739(9 to 4), 746(2 to 8), 765(5 to 12), 798(7 to 12), 799(10 to 9), 804(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(737: 80.000000), (739: 0.000000), (746: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(737: 4), (738: 8), (739: 3), (746: 2), (765: 2), (798: 4), (799: 3), (804: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
