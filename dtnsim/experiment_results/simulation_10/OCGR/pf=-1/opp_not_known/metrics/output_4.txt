The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2234(1 to 6), 2235(6 to 10), 2236(9 to 4), 2248(2 to 8), 2268(5 to 12), 2299(7 to 12), 2300(10 to 9), 2306(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2234: 40.000000), (2235: 0.000000), (2236: 0.000000), (2248: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2234: 3), (2235: 8), (2236: 3), (2248: 2), (2268: 2), (2299: 4), (2300: 3), (2306: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
