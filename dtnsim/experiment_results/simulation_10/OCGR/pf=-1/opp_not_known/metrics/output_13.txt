The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1704(1 to 6), 1705(6 to 10), 1706(9 to 4), 1715(2 to 8), 1734(5 to 12), 1770(7 to 12), 1771(10 to 9), 1782(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1704: 40.000000), (1705: 40.000000), (1706: 0.000000), (1715: 125.000000), (1734: 95.000000), (1770: 0.000000), (1771: 100.000000), (1782: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1704: 3), (1705: 8), (1706: 3), (1715: 7), (1734: 4), (1770: 6), (1771: 5), (1782: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
