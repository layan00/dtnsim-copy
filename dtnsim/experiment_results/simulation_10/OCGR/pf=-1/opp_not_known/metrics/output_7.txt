The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1248(1 to 6), 1249(6 to 10), 1250(9 to 4), 1258(2 to 8), 1278(5 to 12), 1311(7 to 12), 1312(10 to 9), 1318(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1248: 40.000000), (1249: 160.000000), (1250: 0.000000), (1258: 0.000000), (1278: 95.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1248: 3), (1249: 8), (1250: 3), (1258: 2), (1278: 4), (1311: 4), (1312: 1), (1318: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
