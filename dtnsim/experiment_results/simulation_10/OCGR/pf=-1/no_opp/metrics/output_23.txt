The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
718(1 to 6), 719(6 to 10), 720(9 to 4), 725(2 to 8), 733(5 to 12), 743(7 to 12), 744(10 to 9), 750(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(718: 80.000000), (719: 160.000000), (720: 40.000000), (725: 0.000000), (743: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(718: 4), (719: 5), (720: 5), (725: 2), (733: 2), (743: 3), (744: 1), (750: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
