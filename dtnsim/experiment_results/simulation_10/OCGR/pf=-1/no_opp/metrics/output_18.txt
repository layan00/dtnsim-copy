The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
675(1 to 6), 676(6 to 10), 677(9 to 4), 682(2 to 8), 691(5 to 12), 701(7 to 12), 702(10 to 9), 704(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(676: 160.000000), (682: 0.000000), (691: 95.000000), (701: 80.000000), (702: 100.000000), (704: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(675: 2), (676: 7), (677: 6), (682: 2), (691: 4), (701: 3), (702: 5), (704: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
