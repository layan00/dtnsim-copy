The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
303(1 to 6), 304(6 to 10), 305(9 to 4), 307(2 to 8), 316(5 to 12), 325(7 to 12), 326(10 to 9), 331(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(303: 80.000000), (307: 0.000000), (325: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(303: 4), (304: 5), (305: 3), (307: 2), (316: 2), (325: 3), (326: 3), (331: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
