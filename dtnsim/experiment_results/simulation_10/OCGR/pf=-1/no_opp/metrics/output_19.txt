The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
874(1 to 6), 875(6 to 10), 876(9 to 4), 879(2 to 8), 889(5 to 12), 897(7 to 12), 898(10 to 9), 899(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(875: 160.000000), (879: 0.000000), (889: 95.000000), (897: 80.000000), (899: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(874: 1), (875: 6), (876: 6), (879: 2), (889: 4), (897: 4), (898: 1), (899: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
