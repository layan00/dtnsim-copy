The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
484(1 to 6), 485(6 to 10), 486(9 to 4), 491(2 to 8), 499(5 to 12), 509(7 to 12), 510(10 to 9), 512(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(491: 0.000000), (510: 40.000000), (512: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(484: 2), (485: 4), (486: 6), (491: 2), (499: 3), (509: 2), (510: 4), (512: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
