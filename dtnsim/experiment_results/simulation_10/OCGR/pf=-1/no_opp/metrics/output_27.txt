The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
520(1 to 6), 521(6 to 10), 522(9 to 4), 524(2 to 8), 536(5 to 12), 544(7 to 12), 545(10 to 9), 548(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(520: 80.000000), (521: 160.000000), (522: 140.000000), (524: 0.000000), (536: 95.000000), (544: 80.000000), (545: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(520: 4), (521: 6), (522: 5), (524: 2), (536: 4), (544: 3), (545: 5), (548: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
