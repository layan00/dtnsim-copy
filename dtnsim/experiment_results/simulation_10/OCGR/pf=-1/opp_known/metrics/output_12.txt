The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
999(1 to 6), 1000(6 to 10), 1001(9 to 4), 1008(2 to 8), 1016(5 to 12), 1035(7 to 12), 1036(10 to 9), 1046(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(999: 40.000000), (1000: 160.000000), (1001: 0.000000), (1008: 25.000000), (1016: 95.000000), (1035: 120.000000), (1036: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(999: 3), (1000: 10), (1001: 3), (1008: 3), (1016: 5), (1035: 8), (1036: 4), (1046: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
