The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1787(1 to 6), 1788(6 to 10), 1789(9 to 4), 1801(2 to 8), 1811(5 to 12), 1830(7 to 12), 1831(10 to 9), 1837(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1787: 40.000000), (1788: 0.000000), (1789: 0.000000), (1801: 0.000000), (1830: 80.000000), (1831: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1787: 3), (1788: 8), (1789: 3), (1801: 2), (1811: 2), (1830: 7), (1831: 6), (1837: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
