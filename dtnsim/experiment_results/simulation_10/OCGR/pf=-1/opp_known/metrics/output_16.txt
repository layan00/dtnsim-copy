The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
632(1 to 6), 633(6 to 10), 634(9 to 4), 640(2 to 8), 648(5 to 12), 669(7 to 12), 670(10 to 9), 674(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(632: 80.000000), (634: 0.000000), (640: 0.000000), (669: 80.000000), (670: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(632: 4), (633: 3), (634: 3), (640: 2), (648: 2), (669: 7), (670: 6), (674: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
