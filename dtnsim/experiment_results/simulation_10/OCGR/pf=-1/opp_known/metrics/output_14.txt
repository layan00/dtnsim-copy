The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1769(1 to 6), 1770(6 to 10), 1771(9 to 4), 1780(2 to 8), 1791(5 to 12), 1814(7 to 12), 1815(10 to 9), 1828(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1769: 40.000000), (1770: 40.000000), (1771: 0.000000), (1791: 95.000000), (1814: 0.000000), (1815: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1769: 3), (1770: 8), (1771: 3), (1780: 6), (1791: 4), (1814: 6), (1815: 4), (1828: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
