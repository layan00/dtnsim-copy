The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
647(1 to 6), 648(6 to 10), 649(9 to 4), 657(2 to 8), 668(5 to 12), 691(7 to 12), 692(10 to 9), 708(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(647: 40.000000), (648: 40.000000), (649: 0.000000), (657: 0.000000), (668: 95.000000), (691: 0.000000), (692: 40.000000), (708: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(647: 3), (648: 13), (649: 3), (657: 2), (668: 4), (691: 6), (692: 4), (708: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
