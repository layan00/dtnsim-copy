The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
987(1 to 6), 988(6 to 10), 989(9 to 4), 996(2 to 8), 1004(5 to 12), 1023(7 to 12), 1024(10 to 9), 1036(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(987: 40.000000), (988: 160.000000), (989: 0.000000), (996: 25.000000), (1004: 95.000000), (1023: 120.000000), (1024: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(987: 3), (988: 10), (989: 3), (996: 3), (1004: 5), (1023: 8), (1024: 5), (1036: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
