The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1028(1 to 6), 1029(6 to 10), 1030(9 to 4), 1036(2 to 8), 1043(5 to 12), 1064(7 to 12), 1065(10 to 9), 1078(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1028: 80.000000), (1029: 40.000000), (1030: 80.000000), (1036: 0.000000), (1043: 95.000000), (1064: 0.000000), (1065: 80.000000), (1078: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1028: 4), (1029: 8), (1030: 4), (1036: 2), (1043: 5), (1064: 6), (1065: 6), (1078: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
