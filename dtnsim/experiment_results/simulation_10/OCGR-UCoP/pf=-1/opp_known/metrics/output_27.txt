The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1029(1 to 6), 1030(6 to 10), 1031(9 to 4), 1036(2 to 8), 1048(5 to 12), 1068(7 to 12), 1069(10 to 9), 1080(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1029: 40.000000), (1030: 120.000000), (1031: 80.000000), (1036: 0.000000), (1048: 95.000000), (1068: 0.000000), (1069: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1029: 3), (1030: 9), (1031: 4), (1036: 2), (1048: 4), (1068: 6), (1069: 5), (1080: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
