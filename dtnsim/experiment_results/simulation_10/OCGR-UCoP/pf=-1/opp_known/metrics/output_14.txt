The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1759(1 to 6), 1760(6 to 10), 1761(9 to 4), 1770(2 to 8), 1781(5 to 12), 1804(7 to 12), 1805(10 to 9), 1820(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1759: 40.000000), (1760: 40.000000), (1761: 0.000000), (1781: 95.000000), (1804: 0.000000), (1805: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1759: 3), (1760: 8), (1761: 3), (1770: 6), (1781: 4), (1804: 6), (1805: 5), (1820: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
