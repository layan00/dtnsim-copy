The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1800(1 to 6), 1801(6 to 10), 1802(9 to 4), 1808(2 to 8), 1820(5 to 12), 1844(7 to 12), 1845(10 to 9), 1857(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1800: 40.000000), (1801: 80.000000), (1802: 0.000000), (1808: 0.000000), (1844: 0.000000), (1857: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1800: 3), (1801: 8), (1802: 3), (1808: 2), (1820: 3), (1844: 6), (1845: 4), (1857: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
