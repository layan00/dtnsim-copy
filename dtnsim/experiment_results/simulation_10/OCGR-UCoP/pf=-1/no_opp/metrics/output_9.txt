The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
918(1 to 6), 919(6 to 10), 920(9 to 4), 922(2 to 8), 930(5 to 12), 941(7 to 12), 942(10 to 9), 949(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(922: 0.000000), (941: 80.000000), (942: 40.000000), (949: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(918: 1), (919: 4), (920: 3), (922: 2), (930: 2), (941: 3), (942: 4), (949: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
