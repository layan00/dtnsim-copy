The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
712(1 to 6), 713(6 to 10), 714(9 to 4), 719(2 to 8), 726(5 to 12), 735(7 to 12), 736(10 to 9), 738(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(719: 0.000000), (726: 95.000000), (735: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(712: 2), (713: 5), (714: 5), (719: 2), (726: 4), (735: 4), (736: 2), (738: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
