The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
524(1 to 6), 525(6 to 10), 526(9 to 4), 528(2 to 8), 540(5 to 12), 548(7 to 12), 549(10 to 9), 554(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(524: 80.000000), (526: 140.000000), (528: 0.000000), (540: 95.000000), (548: 80.000000), (549: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(524: 4), (525: 2), (526: 6), (528: 2), (540: 4), (548: 3), (549: 5), (554: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
