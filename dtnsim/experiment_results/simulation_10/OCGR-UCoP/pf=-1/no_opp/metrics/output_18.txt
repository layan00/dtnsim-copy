The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
674(1 to 6), 675(6 to 10), 676(9 to 4), 681(2 to 8), 690(5 to 12), 700(7 to 12), 701(10 to 9), 705(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(681: 0.000000), (690: 95.000000), (700: 80.000000), (701: 100.000000), (705: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(674: 2), (675: 2), (676: 6), (681: 2), (690: 4), (700: 3), (701: 5), (705: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
