The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
717(1 to 6), 718(6 to 10), 719(9 to 4), 724(2 to 8), 732(5 to 12), 742(7 to 12), 743(10 to 9), 751(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(717: 80.000000), (718: 160.000000), (719: 40.000000), (724: 0.000000), (742: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(717: 4), (718: 5), (719: 5), (724: 2), (732: 2), (742: 3), (743: 3), (751: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
