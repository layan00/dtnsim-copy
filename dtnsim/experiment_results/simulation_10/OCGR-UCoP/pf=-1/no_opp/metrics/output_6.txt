The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
320(1 to 6), 321(6 to 10), 322(9 to 4), 324(2 to 8), 335(5 to 12), 344(7 to 12), 345(10 to 9), 353(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(320: 80.000000), (324: 0.000000), (335: 95.000000), (344: 80.000000), (345: 40.000000), (353: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(320: 4), (321: 4), (322: 4), (324: 2), (335: 5), (344: 3), (345: 4), (353: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
