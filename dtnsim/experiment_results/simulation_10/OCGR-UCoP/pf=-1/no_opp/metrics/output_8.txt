The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
723(1 to 6), 724(6 to 10), 725(9 to 4), 727(2 to 8), 734(5 to 12), 745(7 to 12), 746(10 to 9), 752(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(724: 160.000000), (725: 140.000000), (727: 0.000000), (734: 95.000000), (745: 80.000000), (746: 100.000000), (752: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(723: 2), (724: 5), (725: 6), (727: 2), (734: 4), (745: 3), (746: 5), (752: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
