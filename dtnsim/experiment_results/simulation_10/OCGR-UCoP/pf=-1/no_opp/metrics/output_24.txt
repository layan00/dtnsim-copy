The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
921(1 to 6), 922(6 to 10), 923(9 to 4), 928(2 to 8), 940(5 to 12), 952(7 to 12), 953(10 to 9), 961(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(921: 80.000000), (923: 40.000000), (928: 0.000000), (952: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(921: 4), (922: 5), (923: 5), (928: 2), (940: 2), (952: 3), (953: 3), (961: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
