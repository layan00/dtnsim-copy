The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
300(1 to 6), 301(6 to 10), 302(9 to 4), 304(2 to 8), 314(5 to 12), 323(7 to 12), 324(10 to 9), 332(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(300: 80.000000), (304: 0.000000), (323: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(300: 4), (301: 5), (302: 5), (304: 2), (314: 2), (323: 3), (324: 3), (332: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
