The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
870(1 to 6), 871(6 to 10), 872(9 to 4), 877(2 to 8), 888(5 to 12), 899(7 to 12), 900(10 to 9), 909(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(870: 80.000000), (871: 160.000000), (872: 40.000000), (877: 125.000000), (888: 95.000000), (899: 80.000000), (900: 40.000000), (909: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(870: 4), (871: 5), (872: 5), (877: 6), (888: 4), (899: 3), (900: 4), (909: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
