The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
129(1 to 6), 130(6 to 10), 131(9 to 4), 136(2 to 8), 146(5 to 12), 156(7 to 12), 157(10 to 9), 163(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(129: 80.000000), (131: 40.000000), (136: 0.000000), (146: 95.000000), (157: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(129: 4), (130: 3), (131: 5), (136: 2), (146: 5), (156: 2), (157: 4), (163: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
