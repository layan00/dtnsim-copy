The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
518(1 to 6), 519(6 to 10), 520(9 to 4), 523(2 to 8), 531(5 to 12), 540(7 to 12), 541(10 to 9), 547(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(518: 120.000000), (519: 160.000000), (523: 0.000000), (531: 95.000000), (540: 80.000000), (541: 40.000000), (547: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(518: 5), (519: 7), (520: 3), (523: 2), (531: 5), (540: 3), (541: 4), (547: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
