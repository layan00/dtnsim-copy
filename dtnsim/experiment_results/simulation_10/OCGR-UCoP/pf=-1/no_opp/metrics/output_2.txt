The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
525(1 to 6), 526(6 to 10), 527(9 to 4), 532(2 to 8), 539(5 to 12), 546(7 to 12), 547(10 to 9), 551(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 140.000000), (532: 25.000000), (539: 95.000000), (546: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(525: 2), (526: 2), (527: 6), (532: 3), (539: 4), (546: 3), (547: 2), (551: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
