The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
324(1 to 6), 325(6 to 10), 326(9 to 4), 329(2 to 8), 340(5 to 12), 351(7 to 12), 352(10 to 9), 359(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(329: 0.000000), (340: 95.000000), (351: 80.000000), (352: 40.000000), (359: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(324: 1), (325: 4), (326: 7), (329: 2), (340: 4), (351: 3), (352: 4), (359: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
