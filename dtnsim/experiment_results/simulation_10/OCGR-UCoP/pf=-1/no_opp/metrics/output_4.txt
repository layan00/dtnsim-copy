The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
896(1 to 6), 897(6 to 10), 898(9 to 4), 903(2 to 8), 914(5 to 12), 921(7 to 12), 922(10 to 9), 927(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(896: 80.000000), (898: 40.000000), (903: 0.000000), (921: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(896: 4), (897: 2), (898: 5), (903: 2), (914: 2), (921: 4), (922: 3), (927: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
