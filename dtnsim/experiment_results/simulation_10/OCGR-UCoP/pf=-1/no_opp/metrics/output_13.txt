The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
662(1 to 6), 663(6 to 10), 664(9 to 4), 669(2 to 8), 678(5 to 12), 690(7 to 12), 691(10 to 9), 700(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(662: 80.000000), (663: 160.000000), (664: 40.000000), (669: 125.000000), (678: 95.000000), (690: 80.000000), (691: 100.000000), (700: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(662: 4), (663: 5), (664: 5), (669: 7), (678: 4), (690: 3), (691: 5), (700: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
