The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
326(1 to 6), 327(6 to 10), 328(9 to 4), 333(2 to 8), 344(5 to 12), 356(7 to 12), 357(10 to 9), 365(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(326: 80.000000), (327: 160.000000), (328: 40.000000), (333: 0.000000), (344: 95.000000), (356: 80.000000), (357: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(326: 4), (327: 5), (328: 5), (333: 2), (344: 4), (356: 3), (357: 4), (365: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
