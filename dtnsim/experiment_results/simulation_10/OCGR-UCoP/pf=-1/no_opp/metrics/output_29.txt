The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
916(1 to 6), 917(6 to 10), 918(9 to 4), 920(2 to 8), 932(5 to 12), 944(7 to 12), 945(10 to 9), 953(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(918: 140.000000), (920: 0.000000), (945: 40.000000), (953: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(916: 5), (917: 3), (918: 5), (920: 2), (932: 3), (944: 2), (945: 4), (953: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
