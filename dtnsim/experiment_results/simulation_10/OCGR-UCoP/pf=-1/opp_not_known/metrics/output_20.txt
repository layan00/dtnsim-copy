The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
265(1 to 6), 266(6 to 10), 267(9 to 4), 279(2 to 8), 297(5 to 12), 331(7 to 12), 332(10 to 9), 344(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(266: 0.000000), (267: 0.000000), (279: 0.000000), (297: 135.000000), (331: 0.000000), (344: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(265: 1), (266: 8), (267: 3), (279: 2), (297: 12), (331: 6), (332: 7), (344: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 62 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
