The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
258(1 to 6), 259(6 to 10), 260(9 to 4), 269(2 to 8), 290(5 to 12), 321(7 to 12), 322(10 to 9), 327(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(258: 40.000000), (259: 40.000000), (260: 0.000000), (327: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(258: 3), (259: 8), (260: 3), (269: 3), (290: 3), (321: 3), (322: 2), (327: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 66 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
