The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
256(1 to 6), 257(6 to 10), 258(9 to 4), 268(2 to 8), 285(5 to 12), 319(7 to 12), 320(10 to 9), 336(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(258: 0.000000), (268: 25.000000), (285: 95.000000), (319: 0.000000), (320: 40.000000), (336: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(256: 5), (257: 5), (258: 3), (268: 3), (285: 4), (319: 6), (320: 7), (336: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 47 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
