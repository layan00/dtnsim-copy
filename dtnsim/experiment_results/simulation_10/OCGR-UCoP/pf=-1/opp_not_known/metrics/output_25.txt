The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
261(1 to 6), 262(6 to 10), 263(9 to 4), 275(2 to 8), 296(5 to 12), 331(7 to 12), 332(10 to 9), 347(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 40.000000), (262: 0.000000), (263: 0.000000), (275: 0.000000), (296: 95.000000), (331: 0.000000), (332: 40.000000), (347: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(261: 3), (262: 8), (263: 3), (275: 2), (296: 4), (331: 6), (332: 7), (347: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 5 calls to RUCoP, which took 34 seconds and 14 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
