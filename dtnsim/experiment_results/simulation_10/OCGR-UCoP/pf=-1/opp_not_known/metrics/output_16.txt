The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
734(1 to 6), 735(6 to 10), 736(9 to 4), 742(2 to 8), 761(5 to 12), 794(7 to 12), 795(10 to 9), 806(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(736: 0.000000), (742: 0.000000), (795: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(734: 2), (735: 7), (736: 3), (742: 2), (761: 2), (794: 4), (795: 7), (806: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 69 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
