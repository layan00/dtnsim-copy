The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1750(1 to 6), 1751(6 to 10), 1752(9 to 4), 1764(2 to 8), 1782(5 to 12), 1815(7 to 12), 1816(10 to 9), 1822(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1750: 40.000000), (1751: 0.000000), (1752: 0.000000), (1764: 0.000000), (1816: 40.000000), (1822: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1750: 3), (1751: 8), (1752: 3), (1764: 2), (1782: 3), (1815: 2), (1816: 4), (1822: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 48 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
