The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
740(1 to 6), 741(6 to 10), 742(9 to 4), 750(2 to 8), 768(5 to 12), 798(7 to 12), 799(10 to 9), 809(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(740: 40.000000), (742: 0.000000), (768: 95.000000), (799: 100.000000), (809: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(740: 3), (741: 9), (742: 3), (750: 2), (768: 4), (798: 3), (799: 8), (809: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 84 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
