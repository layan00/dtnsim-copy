The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
645(7 to 5), 647(12 to 5), 656(8 to 4), 658(8 to 3), 659(10 to 7), 673(3 to 7), 690(11 to 1), 694(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(656: 120.000000), (658: 90.000000), (659: 70.000000), (690: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(647: 1), (656: 6), (658: 4), (659: 6), (690: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
