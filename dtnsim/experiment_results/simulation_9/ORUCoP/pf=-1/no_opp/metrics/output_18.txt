The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
571(7 to 5), 573(12 to 5), 582(8 to 4), 584(8 to 3), 585(10 to 7), 598(3 to 7), 615(11 to 1), 620(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(584: 90.000000), (585: 70.000000), (620: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(573: 1), (582: 4), (584: 4), (585: 7), (615: 1), (620: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
