The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
113(7 to 5), 115(12 to 5), 124(8 to 4), 127(8 to 3), 128(10 to 7), 144(3 to 7), 164(11 to 1), 171(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(115: 50.000000), (164: 80.000000), (171: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(115: 8), (128: 7), (144: 2), (164: 3), (171: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
