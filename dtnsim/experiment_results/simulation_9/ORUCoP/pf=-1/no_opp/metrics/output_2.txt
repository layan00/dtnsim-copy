The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
503(7 to 5), 505(12 to 5), 514(8 to 4), 516(8 to 3), 517(10 to 7), 526(3 to 7), 541(11 to 1), 546(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(514: 120.000000), (516: 90.000000), (517: 70.000000), (541: 80.000000), (546: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(505: 1), (514: 3), (516: 3), (517: 7), (541: 3), (546: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
