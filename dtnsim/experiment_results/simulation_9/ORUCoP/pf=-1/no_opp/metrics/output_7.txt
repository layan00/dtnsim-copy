The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
463(7 to 5), 465(12 to 5), 473(8 to 4), 475(8 to 3), 476(10 to 7), 486(3 to 7), 499(11 to 1), 504(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(473: 120.000000), (475: 90.000000), (476: 70.000000), (486: 55.000000), (499: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(465: 1), (473: 3), (475: 4), (476: 4), (486: 3), (499: 3), (504: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
