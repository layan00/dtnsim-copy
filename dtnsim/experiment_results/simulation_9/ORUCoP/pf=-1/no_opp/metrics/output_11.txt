The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
276(7 to 5), 278(12 to 5), 285(8 to 4), 287(8 to 3), 288(10 to 7), 299(3 to 7), 318(11 to 1), 323(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(278: 50.000000), (288: 70.000000), (318: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(278: 5), (288: 7), (318: 3), (323: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
