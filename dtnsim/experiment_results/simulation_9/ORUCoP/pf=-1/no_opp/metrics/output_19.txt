The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
750(7 to 5), 752(12 to 5), 762(8 to 4), 765(8 to 3), 766(10 to 7), 781(3 to 7), 798(11 to 1), 803(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(765: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(752: 3), (762: 4), (765: 4), (766: 3), (781: 2), (798: 1), (803: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
