The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
97(7 to 5), 99(12 to 5), 108(8 to 4), 110(8 to 3), 111(10 to 7), 128(3 to 7), 145(11 to 1), 151(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(99: 50.000000), (108: 120.000000), (110: 90.000000), (145: 80.000000), (151: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(99: 5), (108: 3), (110: 4), (111: 7), (145: 3), (151: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
