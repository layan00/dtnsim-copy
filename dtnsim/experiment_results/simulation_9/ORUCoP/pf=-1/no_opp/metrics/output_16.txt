The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
263(7 to 5), 265(12 to 5), 273(8 to 4), 275(8 to 3), 276(10 to 7), 285(3 to 7), 298(11 to 1), 301(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(275: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(265: 1), (273: 2), (275: 4), (276: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 273: (to: 3, time: 120.000000),
