The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
285(7 to 5), 287(12 to 5), 297(8 to 4), 300(8 to 3), 301(10 to 7), 316(3 to 7), 331(11 to 1), 333(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(287: 50.000000), (297: 120.000000), (300: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(287: 8), (297: 3), (300: 4), (301: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
