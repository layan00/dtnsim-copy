The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
445(7 to 5), 447(12 to 5), 456(8 to 4), 459(8 to 3), 460(10 to 7), 472(3 to 7), 490(11 to 1), 497(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(490: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(447: 4), (456: 1), (459: 3), (460: 7), (472: 2), (490: 3), (497: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
