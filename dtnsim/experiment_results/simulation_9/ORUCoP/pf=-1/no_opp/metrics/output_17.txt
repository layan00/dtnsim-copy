The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
410(7 to 5), 412(12 to 5), 420(8 to 4), 422(8 to 3), 423(10 to 7), 432(3 to 7), 448(11 to 1), 454(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(423: 70.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(412: 1), (423: 8), (448: 1), (454: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 423: (to: 9, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 423: (to: 6, time: 80.000000), (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 454: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 423: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 423: (to: 7, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 423: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 5, time: 60.000000), 
Node 11: 
Bundle 448: (to: 3, time: 80.000000),
