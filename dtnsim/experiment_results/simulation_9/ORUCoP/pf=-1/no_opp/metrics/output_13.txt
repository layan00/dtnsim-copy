The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
633(7 to 5), 635(12 to 5), 644(8 to 4), 647(8 to 3), 648(10 to 7), 663(3 to 7), 683(11 to 1), 688(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(635: 50.000000), (648: 70.000000), (683: 80.000000), (688: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(635: 8), (648: 7), (683: 3), (688: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
