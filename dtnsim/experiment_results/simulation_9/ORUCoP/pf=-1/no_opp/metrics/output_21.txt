The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
286(7 to 5), 288(12 to 5), 298(8 to 4), 301(8 to 3), 302(10 to 7), 317(3 to 7), 335(11 to 1), 340(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(288: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(288: 8), (302: 6), (335: 1), (340: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 302: (to: 9, time: 80.000000),
