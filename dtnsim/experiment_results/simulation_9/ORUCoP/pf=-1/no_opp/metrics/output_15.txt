The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
99(7 to 5), 101(12 to 5), 111(8 to 4), 114(8 to 3), 115(10 to 7), 125(3 to 7), 142(11 to 1), 149(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(101: 50.000000), (115: 50.000000), (142: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(101: 4), (115: 8), (142: 3), (149: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 115: (to: 9, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 101: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),

Bundle 149: (to: 1, time: 85.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 115: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
