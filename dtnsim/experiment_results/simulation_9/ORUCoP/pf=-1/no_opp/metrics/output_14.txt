The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
815(7 to 5), 817(12 to 5), 826(8 to 4), 829(8 to 3), 830(10 to 7), 845(3 to 7), 862(11 to 1), 867(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(817: 50.000000), (829: 90.000000), (867: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(817: 4), (826: 4), (829: 4), (830: 6), (845: 1), (862: 1), (867: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
