The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
113(7 to 5), 119(12 to 5), 130(8 to 4), 134(8 to 3), 135(10 to 7), 153(3 to 7), 174(11 to 1), 182(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(113: 60.000000), (119: 50.000000), (130: 120.000000), (134: 90.000000), (174: 80.000000), (182: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(113: 7), (119: 8), (130: 6), (134: 4), (135: 6), (153: 6), (174: 6), (182: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 83 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
