The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
814(7 to 5), 816(12 to 5), 825(8 to 4), 827(8 to 3), 828(10 to 7), 847(3 to 7), 865(11 to 1), 870(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(816: 50.000000), (827: 90.000000), (828: 70.000000), (847: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(816: 5), (825: 4), (827: 4), (828: 6), (847: 3), (865: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
