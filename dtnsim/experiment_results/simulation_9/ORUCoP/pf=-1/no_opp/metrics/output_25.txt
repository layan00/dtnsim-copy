The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
110(7 to 5), 112(12 to 5), 122(8 to 4), 125(8 to 3), 126(10 to 7), 145(3 to 7), 165(11 to 1), 170(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(112: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(112: 8), (122: 1), (125: 3), (126: 6), (165: 1), (170: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 126: (to: 9, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 112: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
