The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
98(7 to 5), 100(12 to 5), 108(8 to 4), 110(8 to 3), 111(10 to 7), 130(3 to 7), 148(11 to 1), 156(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(100: 50.000000), (108: 120.000000), (110: 90.000000), (111: 50.000000), (148: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(100: 5), (108: 6), (110: 3), (111: 8), (130: 2), (148: 3), (156: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
