The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
835(7 to 5), 837(12 to 5), 846(8 to 4), 849(8 to 3), 850(10 to 7), 864(3 to 7), 878(11 to 1), 882(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(846: 120.000000), (849: 90.000000), (878: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(837: 4), (846: 6), (849: 4), (850: 5), (878: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
