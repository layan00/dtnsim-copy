The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
670(7 to 5), 672(12 to 5), 680(8 to 4), 682(8 to 3), 683(10 to 7), 693(3 to 7), 706(11 to 1), 710(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(680: 120.000000), (682: 90.000000), (693: 55.000000), (706: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(672: 3), (680: 3), (682: 4), (693: 3), (706: 3), (710: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
