The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
640(7 to 5), 642(12 to 5), 650(8 to 4), 652(8 to 3), 653(10 to 7), 665(3 to 7), 682(11 to 1), 687(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(682: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(642: 1), (653: 5), (665: 2), (682: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
