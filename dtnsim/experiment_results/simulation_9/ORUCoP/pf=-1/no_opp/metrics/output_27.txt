The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
457(7 to 5), 459(12 to 5), 469(8 to 4), 472(8 to 3), 473(10 to 7), 482(3 to 7), 500(11 to 1), 506(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(469: 120.000000), (472: 90.000000), (500: 80.000000), (506: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(459: 2), (469: 3), (472: 4), (473: 6), (482: 2), (500: 3), (506: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
