The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
832(7 to 5), 834(12 to 5), 844(8 to 4), 847(8 to 3), 848(10 to 7), 864(3 to 7), 882(11 to 1), 887(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(834: 50.000000), (844: 120.000000), (847: 90.000000), (882: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(834: 4), (844: 6), (847: 4), (848: 6), (882: 3), (887: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
