The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
285(7 to 5), 287(12 to 5), 297(8 to 4), 300(8 to 3), 301(10 to 7), 319(3 to 7), 340(11 to 1), 344(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(287: 50.000000), (301: 70.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(287: 8), (297: 2), (300: 3), (301: 6), (340: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
