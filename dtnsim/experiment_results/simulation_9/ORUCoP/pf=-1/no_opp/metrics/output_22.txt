The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
456(7 to 5), 458(12 to 5), 467(8 to 4), 470(8 to 3), 471(10 to 7), 482(3 to 7), 498(11 to 1), 504(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(458: 50.000000), (467: 120.000000), (470: 90.000000), (471: 50.000000), (498: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(458: 4), (467: 3), (470: 4), (471: 7), (498: 3), (504: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
