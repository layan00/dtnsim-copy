The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
634(7 to 5), 636(12 to 5), 645(8 to 4), 648(8 to 3), 649(10 to 7), 661(3 to 7), 675(11 to 1), 680(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(648: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 3), (645: 2), (648: 4), (649: 3), (661: 2), (675: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
