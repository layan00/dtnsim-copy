The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
233(7 to 5), 235(12 to 5), 257(8 to 4), 261(8 to 3), 262(10 to 7), 305(3 to 7), 361(11 to 1), 371(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(233: 60.000000), (235: 10.000000), (257: 120.000000), (261: 90.000000), (305: 35.000000), (361: 20.000000), (371: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(233: 5), (235: 6), (257: 3), (261: 6), (262: 8), (305: 6), (361: 5), (371: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 174 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
