The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1696(7 to 5), 1702(12 to 5), 1724(8 to 4), 1729(8 to 3), 1730(10 to 7), 1767(3 to 7), 1826(11 to 1), 1835(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1696: 60.000000), (1702: 10.000000), (1730: 70.000000), (1767: 35.000000), (1826: 20.000000), (1835: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1696: 9), (1702: 6), (1730: 7), (1767: 6), (1826: 5), (1835: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 117 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
