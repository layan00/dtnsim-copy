The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
740(7 to 5), 744(12 to 5), 767(8 to 4), 771(8 to 3), 772(10 to 7), 808(3 to 7), 863(11 to 1), 872(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(744: 10.000000), (808: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(740: 2), (744: 6), (772: 6), (808: 6), (863: 3), (872: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 125 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
