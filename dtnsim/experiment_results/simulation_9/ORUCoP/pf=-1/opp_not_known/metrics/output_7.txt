The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1233(7 to 5), 1237(12 to 5), 1258(8 to 4), 1266(8 to 3), 1267(10 to 7), 1302(3 to 7), 1352(11 to 1), 1361(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1237: 10.000000), (1258: 120.000000), (1266: 90.000000), (1267: 70.000000), (1302: 55.000000), (1352: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1233: 6), (1237: 6), (1258: 3), (1266: 6), (1267: 9), (1302: 3), (1352: 5), (1361: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 114 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
