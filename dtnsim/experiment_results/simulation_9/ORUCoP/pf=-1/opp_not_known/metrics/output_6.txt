The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
732(7 to 5), 740(12 to 5), 759(8 to 4), 761(8 to 3), 762(10 to 7), 811(3 to 7), 873(11 to 1), 883(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(732: 60.000000), (740: 50.000000), (761: 70.000000), (762: 70.000000), (811: 35.000000), (873: 20.000000), (883: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(732: 13), (740: 7), (759: 2), (761: 6), (762: 8), (811: 6), (873: 4), (883: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 136 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
