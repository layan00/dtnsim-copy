The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(7 to 5), 254(12 to 5), 273(8 to 4), 275(8 to 3), 276(10 to 7), 326(3 to 7), 387(11 to 1), 398(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 60.000000), (254: 50.000000), (275: 130.000000), (326: 35.000000), (387: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 13), (254: 7), (273: 1), (275: 6), (276: 6), (326: 6), (387: 4), (398: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 145 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
