The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
249(7 to 5), 257(12 to 5), 276(8 to 4), 278(8 to 3), 279(10 to 7), 325(3 to 7), 383(11 to 1), 391(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(249: 60.000000), (257: 50.000000), (276: 120.000000), (278: 90.000000), (383: 20.000000), (391: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(249: 12), (257: 6), (276: 6), (278: 6), (279: 7), (325: 7), (383: 5), (391: 11), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
