The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
762(7 to 5), 770(12 to 5), 789(8 to 4), 791(8 to 3), 792(10 to 7), 839(3 to 7), 899(11 to 1), 911(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(762: 60.000000), (770: 50.000000), (791: 90.000000), (792: 50.000000), (839: 35.000000), (899: 20.000000), (911: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(762: 13), (770: 7), (789: 2), (791: 6), (792: 8), (839: 8), (899: 4), (911: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
