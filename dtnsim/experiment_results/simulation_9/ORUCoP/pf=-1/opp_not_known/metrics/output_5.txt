The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
234(7 to 5), 236(12 to 5), 257(8 to 4), 261(8 to 3), 262(10 to 7), 307(3 to 7), 364(11 to 1), 376(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 60.000000), (236: 10.000000), (257: 120.000000), (261: 90.000000), (262: 50.000000), (307: 35.000000), (364: 80.000000), (376: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(234: 5), (236: 6), (257: 6), (261: 3), (262: 8), (307: 8), (364: 5), (376: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 179 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
