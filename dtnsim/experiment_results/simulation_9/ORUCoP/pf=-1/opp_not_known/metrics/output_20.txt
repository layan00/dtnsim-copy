The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
249(7 to 5), 257(12 to 5), 275(8 to 4), 277(8 to 3), 278(10 to 7), 325(3 to 7), 386(11 to 1), 397(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(249: 60.000000), (257: 50.000000), (325: 35.000000), (386: 80.000000), (397: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(249: 13), (257: 7), (278: 8), (325: 9), (386: 5), (397: 11), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 166 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
