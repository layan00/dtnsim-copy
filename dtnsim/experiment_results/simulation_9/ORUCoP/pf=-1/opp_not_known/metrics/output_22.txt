The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1208(7 to 5), 1210(12 to 5), 1232(8 to 4), 1236(8 to 3), 1237(10 to 7), 1276(3 to 7), 1330(11 to 1), 1338(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1208: 60.000000), (1210: 10.000000), (1232: 120.000000), (1236: 90.000000), (1237: 50.000000), (1330: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1208: 5), (1210: 6), (1232: 3), (1236: 6), (1237: 7), (1276: 4), (1330: 5), (1338: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 137 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
