The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
712(7 to 5), 720(12 to 5), 737(8 to 4), 739(8 to 3), 740(10 to 7), 782(3 to 7), 834(11 to 1), 841(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(712: 60.000000), (720: 50.000000), (739: 90.000000), (834: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(712: 12), (720: 6), (737: 2), (739: 6), (740: 8), (834: 6), (841: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 126 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
