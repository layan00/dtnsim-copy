The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
230(7 to 5), 232(12 to 5), 239(8 to 4), 241(8 to 3), 242(10 to 7), 285(3 to 7), 316(11 to 1), 320(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(230: 60.000000), (232: 50.000000), (239: 120.000000), (241: 90.000000), (242: 10.000000), (316: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(230: 10), (232: 6), (239: 4), (241: 3), (242: 4), (285: 2), (316: 3), (320: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
