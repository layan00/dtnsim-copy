The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
602(7 to 5), 605(12 to 5), 614(8 to 4), 617(8 to 3), 618(10 to 7), 653(3 to 7), 682(11 to 1), 685(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(602: 60.000000), (605: 50.000000), (618: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(602: 9), (605: 6), (618: 4), (682: 1), (685: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
