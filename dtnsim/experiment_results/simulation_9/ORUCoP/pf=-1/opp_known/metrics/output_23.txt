The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1326(7 to 5), 1329(12 to 5), 1337(8 to 4), 1340(8 to 3), 1341(10 to 7), 1376(3 to 7), 1402(11 to 1), 1406(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1340: 90.000000), (1341: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1326: 8), (1329: 4), (1337: 2), (1340: 6), (1341: 4), (1376: 2), (1402: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
