The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1337(7 to 5), 1340(12 to 5), 1348(8 to 4), 1351(8 to 3), 1352(10 to 7), 1388(3 to 7), 1418(11 to 1), 1421(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1337: 40.000000), (1340: 50.000000), (1352: 10.000000), (1418: 80.000000), (1421: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1337: 9), (1340: 6), (1352: 4), (1418: 3), (1421: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
