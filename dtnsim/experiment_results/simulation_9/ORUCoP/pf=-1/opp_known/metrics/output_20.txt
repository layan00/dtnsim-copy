The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(7 to 5), 248(12 to 5), 256(8 to 4), 259(8 to 3), 260(10 to 7), 297(3 to 7), 327(11 to 1), 331(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(245: 40.000000), (248: 50.000000), (260: 10.000000), (327: 80.000000), (331: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 9), (248: 6), (260: 4), (297: 2), (327: 3), (331: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
