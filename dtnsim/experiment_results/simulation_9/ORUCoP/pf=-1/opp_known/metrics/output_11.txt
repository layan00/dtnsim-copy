The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
601(7 to 5), 604(12 to 5), 610(8 to 4), 613(8 to 3), 614(10 to 7), 647(3 to 7), 677(11 to 1), 680(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(601: 60.000000), (604: 50.000000), (614: 10.000000), (677: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(601: 9), (604: 6), (614: 4), (677: 3), (680: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
