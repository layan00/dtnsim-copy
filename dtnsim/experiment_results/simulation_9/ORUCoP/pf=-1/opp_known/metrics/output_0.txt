The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(7 to 5), 257(12 to 5), 266(8 to 4), 270(8 to 3), 271(10 to 7), 303(3 to 7), 333(11 to 1), 341(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(245: 20.000000), (257: 50.000000), (266: 120.000000), (270: 90.000000), (271: 10.000000), (303: 35.000000), (333: 20.000000), (341: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 12), (257: 6), (266: 6), (270: 6), (271: 4), (303: 6), (333: 5), (341: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 556 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
