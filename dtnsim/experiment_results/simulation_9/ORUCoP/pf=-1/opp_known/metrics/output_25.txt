The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
242(7 to 5), 245(12 to 5), 254(8 to 4), 257(8 to 3), 258(10 to 7), 299(3 to 7), 330(11 to 1), 337(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 40.000000), (245: 50.000000), (257: 130.000000), (258: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(242: 9), (245: 6), (254: 5), (257: 8), (258: 4), (330: 1), (337: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
