The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
957(7 to 5), 959(12 to 5), 967(8 to 4), 969(8 to 3), 970(10 to 7), 1004(3 to 7), 1034(11 to 1), 1038(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(959: 50.000000), (969: 130.000000), (970: 10.000000), (1034: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(957: 6), (959: 6), (967: 1), (969: 10), (970: 4), (1004: 2), (1034: 3), (1038: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
