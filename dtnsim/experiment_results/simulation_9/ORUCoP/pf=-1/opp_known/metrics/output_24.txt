The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1698(7 to 5), 1701(12 to 5), 1709(8 to 4), 1712(8 to 3), 1713(10 to 7), 1755(3 to 7), 1783(11 to 1), 1791(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1698: 40.000000), (1701: 50.000000), (1712: 90.000000), (1713: 10.000000), (1755: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1698: 9), (1701: 5), (1709: 6), (1712: 6), (1713: 3), (1755: 3), (1783: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
