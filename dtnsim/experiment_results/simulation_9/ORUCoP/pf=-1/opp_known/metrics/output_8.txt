The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1342(7 to 5), 1345(12 to 5), 1352(8 to 4), 1355(8 to 3), 1356(10 to 7), 1393(3 to 7), 1422(11 to 1), 1426(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1342: 40.000000), (1345: 50.000000), (1356: 10.000000), (1422: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1342: 9), (1345: 6), (1356: 4), (1393: 2), (1422: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
