The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
231(7 to 5), 234(12 to 5), 243(8 to 4), 246(8 to 3), 247(10 to 7), 280(3 to 7), 307(11 to 1), 310(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 60.000000), (234: 50.000000), (247: 10.000000), (307: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(231: 9), (234: 5), (247: 3), (307: 3), (310: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
