The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
642(7 to 5), 645(12 to 5), 654(8 to 4), 657(8 to 3), 658(10 to 7), 695(3 to 7), 724(11 to 1), 728(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(642: 40.000000), (645: 50.000000), (657: 90.000000), (658: 10.000000), (695: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(642: 9), (645: 6), (654: 2), (657: 6), (658: 4), (695: 3), (724: 1), (728: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
