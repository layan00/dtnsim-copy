The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
920(7 to 5), 923(12 to 5), 930(8 to 4), 933(8 to 3), 934(10 to 7), 967(3 to 7), 996(11 to 1), 999(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(920: 60.000000), (923: 50.000000), (934: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(920: 9), (923: 6), (934: 4), (996: 1), (999: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
