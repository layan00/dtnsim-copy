The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
611(7 to 5), 614(12 to 5), 623(8 to 4), 626(8 to 3), 627(10 to 7), 662(3 to 7), 688(11 to 1), 690(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(611: 60.000000), (614: 50.000000), (623: 120.000000), (626: 90.000000), (627: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(611: 9), (614: 6), (623: 3), (626: 6), (627: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
