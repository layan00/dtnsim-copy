The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
229(7 to 5), 231(12 to 5), 239(8 to 4), 241(8 to 3), 242(10 to 7), 283(3 to 7), 313(11 to 1), 316(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 60.000000), (231: 50.000000), (239: 120.000000), (241: 90.000000), (242: 10.000000), (313: 80.000000), (316: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(229: 10), (231: 6), (239: 6), (241: 6), (242: 4), (313: 3), (316: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
