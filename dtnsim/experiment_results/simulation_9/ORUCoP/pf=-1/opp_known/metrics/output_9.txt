The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1690(7 to 5), 1692(12 to 5), 1700(8 to 4), 1702(8 to 3), 1703(10 to 7), 1742(3 to 7), 1766(11 to 1), 1769(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1702: 130.000000), (1703: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1690: 6), (1692: 4), (1700: 2), (1702: 10), (1703: 4), (1766: 1), (1769: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
