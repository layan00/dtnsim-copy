The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
960(7 to 5), 966(12 to 5), 974(8 to 4), 977(8 to 3), 978(10 to 7), 999(3 to 7), 1026(11 to 1), 1029(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(960: 20.000000), (966: 10.000000), (978: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(960: 6), (966: 3), (974: 2), (977: 2), (978: 3), (999: 4), (1026: 3), (1029: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
