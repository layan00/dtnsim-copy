The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
616(7 to 5), 618(12 to 5), 625(8 to 4), 627(8 to 3), 628(10 to 7), 651(3 to 7), 683(11 to 1), 686(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(618: 50.000000), (628: 10.000000), (651: 0.000000), (683: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(616: 6), (618: 4), (625: 2), (627: 2), (628: 3), (651: 6), (683: 3), (686: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
