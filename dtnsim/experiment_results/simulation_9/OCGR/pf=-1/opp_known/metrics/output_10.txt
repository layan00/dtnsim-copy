The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(7 to 5), 248(12 to 5), 257(8 to 4), 259(8 to 3), 260(10 to 7), 289(3 to 7), 320(11 to 1), 323(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 60.000000), (248: 10.000000), (257: 120.000000), (259: 90.000000), (260: 10.000000), (289: 0.000000), (320: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 6), (248: 3), (257: 3), (259: 3), (260: 3), (289: 6), (320: 3), (323: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
