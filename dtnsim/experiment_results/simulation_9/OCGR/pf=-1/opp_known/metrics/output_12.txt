The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
977(7 to 5), 978(12 to 5), 987(8 to 4), 989(8 to 3), 990(10 to 7), 1015(3 to 7), 1040(11 to 1), 1043(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(978: 10.000000), (989: 130.000000), (990: 10.000000), (1040: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(977: 5), (978: 3), (987: 3), (989: 7), (990: 3), (1015: 1), (1040: 3), (1043: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
