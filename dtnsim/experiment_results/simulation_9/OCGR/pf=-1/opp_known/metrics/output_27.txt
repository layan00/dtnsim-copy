The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
992(7 to 5), 993(12 to 5), 1003(8 to 4), 1005(8 to 3), 1006(10 to 7), 1030(3 to 7), 1055(11 to 1), 1058(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(993: 10.000000), (1003: 120.000000), (1005: 90.000000), (1006: 10.000000), (1058: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(992: 5), (993: 3), (1003: 4), (1005: 3), (1006: 3), (1030: 1), (1055: 3), (1058: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
