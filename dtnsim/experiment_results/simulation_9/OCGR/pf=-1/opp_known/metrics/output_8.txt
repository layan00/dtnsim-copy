The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1360(7 to 5), 1366(12 to 5), 1374(8 to 4), 1377(8 to 3), 1378(10 to 7), 1402(3 to 7), 1429(11 to 1), 1432(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1360: 20.000000), (1366: 10.000000), (1378: 10.000000), (1429: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1360: 6), (1366: 3), (1374: 2), (1377: 2), (1378: 3), (1402: 4), (1429: 3), (1432: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
