The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1715(7 to 5), 1716(12 to 5), 1725(8 to 4), 1727(8 to 3), 1728(10 to 7), 1756(3 to 7), 1778(11 to 1), 1781(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1716: 10.000000), (1727: 130.000000), (1728: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1715: 5), (1716: 3), (1725: 2), (1727: 7), (1728: 3), (1756: 1), (1778: 3), (1781: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
