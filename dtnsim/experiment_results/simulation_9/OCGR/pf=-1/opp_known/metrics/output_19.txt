The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1685(7 to 5), 1687(12 to 5), 1697(8 to 4), 1700(8 to 3), 1701(10 to 7), 1728(3 to 7), 1757(11 to 1), 1762(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1687: 10.000000), (1700: 70.000000), (1701: 10.000000), (1757: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1685: 6), (1687: 3), (1697: 3), (1700: 5), (1701: 3), (1728: 4), (1757: 3), (1762: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
