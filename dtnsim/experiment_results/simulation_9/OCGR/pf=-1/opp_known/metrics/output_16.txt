The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
610(7 to 5), 616(12 to 5), 624(8 to 4), 627(8 to 3), 628(10 to 7), 649(3 to 7), 670(11 to 1), 673(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(610: 20.000000), (616: 10.000000), (627: 90.000000), (628: 10.000000), (670: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(610: 6), (616: 3), (624: 4), (627: 3), (628: 3), (649: 1), (670: 3), (673: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
