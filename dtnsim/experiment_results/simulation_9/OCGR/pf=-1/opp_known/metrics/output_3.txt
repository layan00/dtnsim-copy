The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1368(7 to 5), 1374(12 to 5), 1382(8 to 4), 1383(8 to 3), 1384(10 to 7), 1405(3 to 7), 1428(11 to 1), 1431(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1382: 120.000000), (1383: 90.000000), (1384: 10.000000), (1428: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1368: 7), (1374: 4), (1382: 4), (1383: 3), (1384: 3), (1405: 1), (1428: 3), (1431: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
