The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
995(7 to 5), 997(12 to 5), 1005(8 to 4), 1008(8 to 3), 1009(10 to 7), 1034(3 to 7), 1056(11 to 1), 1059(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(995: 40.000000), (997: 10.000000), (1005: 120.000000), (1008: 90.000000), (1009: 10.000000), (1056: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(995: 6), (997: 3), (1005: 4), (1008: 3), (1009: 3), (1034: 1), (1056: 3), (1059: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
