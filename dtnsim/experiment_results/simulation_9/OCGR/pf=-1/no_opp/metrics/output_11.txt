The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
293(7 to 5), 295(12 to 5), 301(8 to 4), 302(8 to 3), 303(10 to 7), 309(3 to 7), 324(11 to 1), 327(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(324: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(293: 2), (295: 2), (301: 2), (302: 2), (303: 5), (309: 1), (324: 3), (327: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
