The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
615(7 to 5), 616(12 to 5), 624(8 to 4), 625(8 to 3), 626(10 to 7), 636(3 to 7), 648(11 to 1), 650(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(625: 90.000000), (650: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(615: 1), (616: 2), (624: 3), (625: 2), (626: 2), (636: 1), (648: 2), (650: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 650: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
