The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
123(7 to 5), 126(12 to 5), 135(8 to 4), 138(8 to 3), 139(10 to 7), 152(3 to 7), 169(11 to 1), 173(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(123: 60.000000), (126: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(123: 5), (126: 4), (135: 2), (138: 2), (139: 6), (152: 1), (169: 2), (173: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
