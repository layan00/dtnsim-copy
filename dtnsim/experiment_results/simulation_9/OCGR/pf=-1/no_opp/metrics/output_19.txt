The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
789(7 to 5), 791(12 to 5), 800(8 to 4), 802(8 to 3), 803(10 to 7), 816(3 to 7), 830(11 to 1), 836(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(802: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(789: 2), (791: 4), (800: 3), (802: 2), (803: 5), (816: 4), (830: 2), (836: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
