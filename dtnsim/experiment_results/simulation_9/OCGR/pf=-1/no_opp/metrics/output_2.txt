The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
505(7 to 5), 508(12 to 5), 516(8 to 4), 517(8 to 3), 518(10 to 7), 524(3 to 7), 537(11 to 1), 540(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(516: 120.000000), (517: 90.000000), (537: 80.000000), (540: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(505: 3), (508: 2), (516: 4), (517: 3), (518: 5), (524: 1), (537: 3), (540: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
