The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
659(7 to 5), 662(12 to 5), 670(8 to 4), 673(8 to 3), 674(10 to 7), 686(3 to 7), 698(11 to 1), 700(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(673: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(659: 5), (662: 4), (670: 4), (673: 3), (674: 3), (686: 2), (698: 2), (700: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
