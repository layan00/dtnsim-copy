The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
463(7 to 5), 464(12 to 5), 472(8 to 4), 474(8 to 3), 475(10 to 7), 484(3 to 7), 498(11 to 1), 504(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(498: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(463: 1), (464: 3), (472: 3), (474: 3), (475: 5), (484: 4), (498: 3), (504: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
