The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
116(7 to 5), 117(12 to 5), 124(8 to 4), 125(8 to 3), 126(10 to 7), 140(3 to 7), 153(11 to 1), 161(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(124: 120.000000), (125: 90.000000), (126: 50.000000), (140: 35.000000), (153: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(116: 1), (117: 2), (124: 3), (125: 2), (126: 5), (140: 4), (153: 3), (161: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
