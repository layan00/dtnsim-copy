The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
477(7 to 5), 478(12 to 5), 486(8 to 4), 488(8 to 3), 489(10 to 7), 497(3 to 7), 511(11 to 1), 516(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(478: 50.000000), (486: 120.000000), (488: 90.000000), (489: 50.000000), (511: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(477: 1), (478: 4), (486: 4), (488: 3), (489: 6), (497: 1), (511: 3), (516: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
