The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
657(7 to 5), 660(12 to 5), 667(8 to 4), 668(8 to 3), 669(10 to 7), 680(3 to 7), 693(11 to 1), 695(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(693: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(657: 3), (660: 2), (667: 2), (668: 2), (669: 3), (680: 2), (693: 3), (695: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
