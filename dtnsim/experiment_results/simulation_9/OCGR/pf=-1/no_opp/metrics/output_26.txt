The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
304(7 to 5), 307(12 to 5), 316(8 to 4), 319(8 to 3), 320(10 to 7), 331(3 to 7), 342(11 to 1), 343(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(304: 60.000000), (307: 50.000000), (316: 120.000000), (319: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(304: 5), (307: 4), (316: 4), (319: 3), (320: 2), (331: 1), (342: 1), (343: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
