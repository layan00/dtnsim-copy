The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
479(7 to 5), 481(12 to 5), 488(8 to 4), 489(8 to 3), 490(10 to 7), 497(3 to 7), 508(11 to 1), 512(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(488: 120.000000), (489: 90.000000), (508: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(479: 2), (481: 2), (488: 4), (489: 3), (490: 2), (497: 4), (508: 3), (512: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
