The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
848(7 to 5), 849(12 to 5), 858(8 to 4), 860(8 to 3), 861(10 to 7), 874(3 to 7), 887(11 to 1), 889(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(849: 50.000000), (858: 120.000000), (860: 90.000000), (887: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(848: 1), (849: 4), (858: 3), (860: 2), (861: 2), (874: 1), (887: 3), (889: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
