The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
479(7 to 5), 480(12 to 5), 489(8 to 4), 491(8 to 3), 492(10 to 7), 498(3 to 7), 514(11 to 1), 518(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(489: 120.000000), (491: 90.000000), (514: 80.000000), (518: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(479: 1), (480: 3), (489: 4), (491: 3), (492: 5), (498: 3), (514: 3), (518: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
