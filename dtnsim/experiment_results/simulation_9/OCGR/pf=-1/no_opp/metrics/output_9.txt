The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
823(7 to 5), 824(12 to 5), 832(8 to 4), 833(8 to 3), 834(10 to 7), 844(3 to 7), 854(11 to 1), 856(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(823: 1), (824: 2), (832: 2), (833: 2), (834: 2), (844: 1), (854: 2), (856: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
