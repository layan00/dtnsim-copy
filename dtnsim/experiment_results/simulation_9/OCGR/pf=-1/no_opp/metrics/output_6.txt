The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
299(7 to 5), 302(12 to 5), 311(8 to 4), 314(8 to 3), 315(10 to 7), 327(3 to 7), 345(11 to 1), 347(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(299: 60.000000), (302: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(299: 5), (302: 4), (311: 2), (314: 2), (315: 4), (327: 1), (345: 2), (347: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
