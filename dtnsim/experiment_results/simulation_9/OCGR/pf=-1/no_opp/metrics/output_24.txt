The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
842(7 to 5), 845(12 to 5), 853(8 to 4), 854(8 to 3), 855(10 to 7), 867(3 to 7), 881(11 to 1), 883(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(854: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(842: 3), (845: 2), (853: 3), (854: 2), (855: 4), (867: 2), (881: 2), (883: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
