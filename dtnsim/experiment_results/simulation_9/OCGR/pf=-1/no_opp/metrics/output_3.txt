The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
679(7 to 5), 682(12 to 5), 689(8 to 4), 690(8 to 3), 691(10 to 7), 697(3 to 7), 709(11 to 1), 713(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(689: 120.000000), (690: 90.000000), (709: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(679: 3), (682: 2), (689: 4), (690: 3), (691: 2), (697: 4), (709: 3), (713: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
