The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
647(7 to 5), 650(12 to 5), 658(8 to 4), 661(8 to 3), 662(10 to 7), 672(3 to 7), 690(11 to 1), 693(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(647: 60.000000), (650: 50.000000), (690: 80.000000), (693: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(647: 5), (650: 4), (658: 2), (661: 2), (662: 5), (672: 1), (690: 3), (693: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
