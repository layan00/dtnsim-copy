The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
452(7 to 5), 455(12 to 5), 462(8 to 4), 463(8 to 3), 464(10 to 7), 471(3 to 7), 483(11 to 1), 485(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(452: 3), (455: 2), (462: 2), (463: 2), (464: 2), (471: 1), (483: 2), (485: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
