The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
308(7 to 5), 310(12 to 5), 319(8 to 4), 321(8 to 3), 322(10 to 7), 332(3 to 7), 345(11 to 1), 347(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(310: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(308: 2), (310: 4), (319: 2), (321: 2), (322: 2), (332: 1), (345: 2), (347: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
