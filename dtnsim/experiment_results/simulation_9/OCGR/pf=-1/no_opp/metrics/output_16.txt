The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
293(7 to 5), 296(12 to 5), 303(8 to 4), 304(8 to 3), 305(10 to 7), 312(3 to 7), 321(11 to 1), 322(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(304: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(293: 3), (296: 2), (303: 4), (304: 3), (305: 2), (312: 1), (321: 1), (322: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 293: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
