The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
852(7 to 5), 855(12 to 5), 863(8 to 4), 866(8 to 3), 867(10 to 7), 876(3 to 7), 885(11 to 1), 887(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(863: 120.000000), (866: 90.000000), (885: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(852: 4), (855: 3), (863: 3), (866: 2), (867: 2), (876: 1), (885: 3), (887: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
