The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
834(7 to 5), 837(12 to 5), 845(8 to 4), 848(8 to 3), 849(10 to 7), 861(3 to 7), 876(11 to 1), 882(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(834: 60.000000), (837: 50.000000), (848: 90.000000), (882: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(834: 5), (837: 4), (845: 3), (848: 2), (849: 6), (861: 4), (876: 2), (882: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
