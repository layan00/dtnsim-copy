The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
666(7 to 5), 669(12 to 5), 677(8 to 4), 678(8 to 3), 679(10 to 7), 690(3 to 7), 702(11 to 1), 704(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(677: 120.000000), (678: 90.000000), (702: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(666: 3), (669: 2), (677: 3), (678: 2), (679: 2), (690: 1), (702: 3), (704: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
