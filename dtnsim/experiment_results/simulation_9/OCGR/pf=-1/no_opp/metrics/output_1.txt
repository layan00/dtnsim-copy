The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
320(7 to 5), 323(12 to 5), 332(8 to 4), 335(8 to 3), 336(10 to 7), 349(3 to 7), 364(11 to 1), 372(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(320: 60.000000), (323: 50.000000), (335: 90.000000), (336: 50.000000), (349: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(320: 5), (323: 4), (332: 4), (335: 3), (336: 5), (349: 4), (364: 2), (372: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
