The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1216(7 to 5), 1217(12 to 5), 1237(8 to 4), 1239(8 to 3), 1240(10 to 7), 1273(3 to 7), 1324(11 to 1), 1328(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1217: 10.000000), (1237: 120.000000), (1239: 90.000000), (1328: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1216: 5), (1217: 3), (1237: 4), (1239: 3), (1240: 5), (1273: 1), (1324: 3), (1328: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
