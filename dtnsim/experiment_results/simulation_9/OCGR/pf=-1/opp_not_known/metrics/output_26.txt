The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
743(7 to 5), 749(12 to 5), 769(8 to 4), 772(8 to 3), 773(10 to 7), 806(3 to 7), 857(11 to 1), 860(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(743: 20.000000), (749: 10.000000), (769: 120.000000), (772: 90.000000), (806: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(743: 6), (749: 3), (769: 4), (772: 3), (773: 1), (806: 6), (857: 3), (860: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
