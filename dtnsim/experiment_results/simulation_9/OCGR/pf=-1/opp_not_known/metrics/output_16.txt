The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
726(7 to 5), 732(12 to 5), 750(8 to 4), 753(8 to 3), 754(10 to 7), 785(3 to 7), 830(11 to 1), 833(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(726: 20.000000), (732: 10.000000), (753: 90.000000), (830: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(726: 6), (732: 3), (750: 4), (753: 3), (754: 1), (785: 1), (830: 3), (833: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
