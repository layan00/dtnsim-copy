The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2177(7 to 5), 2178(12 to 5), 2198(8 to 4), 2200(8 to 3), 2201(10 to 7), 2241(3 to 7), 2295(11 to 1), 2300(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2177: 60.000000), (2178: 10.000000), (2200: 70.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2177: 6), (2178: 3), (2198: 2), (2200: 5), (2201: 1), (2241: 4), (2295: 3), (2300: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
