The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1184(7 to 5), 1190(12 to 5), 1208(8 to 4), 1211(8 to 3), 1212(10 to 7), 1243(3 to 7), 1294(11 to 1), 1297(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1184: 20.000000), (1190: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1184: 6), (1190: 3), (1208: 2), (1211: 2), (1212: 1), (1243: 4), (1294: 3), (1297: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
