The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
734(7 to 5), 740(12 to 5), 760(8 to 4), 763(8 to 3), 764(10 to 7), 798(3 to 7), 858(11 to 1), 863(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(734: 20.000000), (740: 10.000000), (763: 70.000000), (798: 0.000000), (858: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(734: 6), (740: 3), (760: 2), (763: 5), (764: 4), (798: 6), (858: 3), (863: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
