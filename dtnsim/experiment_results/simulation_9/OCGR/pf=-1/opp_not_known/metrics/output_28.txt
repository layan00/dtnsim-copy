The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1694(7 to 5), 1700(12 to 5), 1719(8 to 4), 1722(8 to 3), 1723(10 to 7), 1758(3 to 7), 1811(11 to 1), 1816(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1694: 20.000000), (1700: 10.000000), (1722: 70.000000), (1811: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1694: 6), (1700: 3), (1719: 2), (1722: 5), (1723: 1), (1758: 4), (1811: 3), (1816: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
