The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2164(7 to 5), 2170(12 to 5), 2189(8 to 4), 2192(8 to 3), 2193(10 to 7), 2226(3 to 7), 2271(11 to 1), 2274(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2164: 20.000000), (2170: 10.000000), (2189: 120.000000), (2192: 90.000000), (2271: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2164: 6), (2170: 3), (2189: 3), (2192: 2), (2193: 1), (2226: 1), (2271: 3), (2274: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
