The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1700(7 to 5), 1706(12 to 5), 1724(8 to 4), 1725(8 to 3), 1726(10 to 7), 1756(3 to 7), 1803(11 to 1), 1806(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1724: 120.000000), (1725: 90.000000), (1803: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1700: 7), (1706: 4), (1724: 4), (1725: 3), (1726: 2), (1756: 1), (1803: 3), (1806: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
