The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2125(7 to 5), 2127(12 to 5), 2147(8 to 4), 2149(8 to 3), 2150(10 to 7), 2185(3 to 7), 2239(11 to 1), 2244(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2127: 10.000000), (2149: 70.000000), (2239: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2125: 2), (2127: 3), (2147: 2), (2149: 5), (2150: 1), (2185: 4), (2239: 3), (2244: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
