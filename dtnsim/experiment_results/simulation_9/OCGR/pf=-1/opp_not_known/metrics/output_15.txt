The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
253(7 to 5), 256(12 to 5), 276(8 to 4), 279(8 to 3), 280(10 to 7), 311(3 to 7), 365(11 to 1), 371(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 60.000000), (256: 10.000000), (280: 50.000000), (365: 20.000000), (371: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 6), (256: 3), (276: 2), (279: 2), (280: 6), (311: 4), (365: 3), (371: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
