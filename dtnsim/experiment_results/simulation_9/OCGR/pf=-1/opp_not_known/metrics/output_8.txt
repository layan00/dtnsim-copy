The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1688(7 to 5), 1694(12 to 5), 1712(8 to 4), 1715(8 to 3), 1716(10 to 7), 1750(3 to 7), 1801(11 to 1), 1804(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1688: 20.000000), (1694: 10.000000), (1801: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1688: 6), (1694: 3), (1712: 2), (1715: 2), (1716: 1), (1750: 4), (1801: 3), (1804: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
