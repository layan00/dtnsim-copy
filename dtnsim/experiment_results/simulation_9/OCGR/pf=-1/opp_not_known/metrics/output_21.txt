The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
733(7 to 5), 735(12 to 5), 755(8 to 4), 757(8 to 3), 758(10 to 7), 791(3 to 7), 845(11 to 1), 848(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(735: 10.000000), (791: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(733: 2), (735: 3), (755: 2), (757: 2), (758: 1), (791: 6), (845: 3), (848: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
