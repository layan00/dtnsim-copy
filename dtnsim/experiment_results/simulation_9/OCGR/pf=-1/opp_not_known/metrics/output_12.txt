The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1203(7 to 5), 1204(12 to 5), 1223(8 to 4), 1225(8 to 3), 1226(10 to 7), 1261(3 to 7), 1310(11 to 1), 1313(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1204: 10.000000), (1310: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1203: 5), (1204: 3), (1223: 3), (1225: 3), (1226: 1), (1261: 1), (1310: 3), (1313: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
