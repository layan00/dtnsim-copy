The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
747(7 to 5), 753(12 to 5), 773(8 to 4), 776(8 to 3), 777(10 to 7), 811(3 to 7), 865(11 to 1), 868(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(747: 20.000000), (753: 10.000000), (776: 90.000000), (811: 0.000000), (865: 20.000000), (868: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(747: 6), (753: 3), (773: 4), (776: 3), (777: 1), (811: 6), (865: 3), (868: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
