The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2151(7 to 5), 2152(12 to 5), 2171(8 to 4), 2173(8 to 3), 2174(10 to 7), 2211(3 to 7), 2257(11 to 1), 2260(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2152: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2151: 5), (2152: 3), (2171: 3), (2173: 3), (2174: 2), (2211: 1), (2257: 3), (2260: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
