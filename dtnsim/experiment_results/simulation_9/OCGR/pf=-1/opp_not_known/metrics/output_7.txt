The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1217(7 to 5), 1219(12 to 5), 1237(8 to 4), 1240(8 to 3), 1241(10 to 7), 1275(3 to 7), 1321(11 to 1), 1324(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1217: 40.000000), (1219: 10.000000), (1237: 120.000000), (1240: 90.000000), (1321: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1217: 5), (1219: 3), (1237: 4), (1240: 3), (1241: 2), (1275: 1), (1321: 3), (1324: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
