The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
251(7 to 5), 252(12 to 5), 271(8 to 4), 273(8 to 3), 274(10 to 7), 312(3 to 7), 369(11 to 1), 374(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(251: 60.000000), (252: 10.000000), (271: 120.000000), (273: 90.000000), (312: 0.000000), (369: 20.000000), (374: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(251: 6), (252: 3), (271: 4), (273: 3), (274: 6), (312: 6), (369: 3), (374: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
