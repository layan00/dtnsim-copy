The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
732(7 to 5), 734(12 to 5), 751(8 to 4), 753(8 to 3), 754(10 to 7), 786(3 to 7), 844(11 to 1), 848(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(734: 50.000000), (786: 0.000000), (844: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(732: 5), (734: 4), (751: 2), (753: 2), (754: 5), (786: 6), (844: 3), (848: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
