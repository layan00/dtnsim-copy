The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2165(7 to 5), 2166(12 to 5), 2185(8 to 4), 2187(8 to 3), 2188(10 to 7), 2227(3 to 7), 2273(11 to 1), 2277(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2166: 10.000000), (2188: 70.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2165: 5), (2166: 3), (2185: 2), (2187: 2), (2188: 4), (2227: 1), (2273: 3), (2277: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
