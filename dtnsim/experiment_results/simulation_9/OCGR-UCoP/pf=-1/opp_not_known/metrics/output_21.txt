The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
737(7 to 5), 739(12 to 5), 759(8 to 4), 761(8 to 3), 762(10 to 7), 796(3 to 7), 850(11 to 1), 853(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(739: 10.000000), (796: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(737: 2), (739: 3), (759: 2), (761: 2), (762: 3), (796: 6), (850: 3), (853: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 74 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
