The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1700(7 to 5), 1706(12 to 5), 1724(8 to 4), 1727(8 to 3), 1728(10 to 7), 1763(3 to 7), 1814(11 to 1), 1818(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1700: 20.000000), (1706: 10.000000), (1814: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1700: 6), (1706: 3), (1724: 2), (1727: 2), (1728: 4), (1763: 4), (1814: 3), (1818: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 89 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
