The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2179(7 to 5), 2180(12 to 5), 2200(8 to 4), 2202(8 to 3), 2203(10 to 7), 2244(3 to 7), 2296(11 to 1), 2299(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2179: 60.000000), (2180: 10.000000), (2200: 120.000000), (2202: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2179: 6), (2180: 3), (2200: 3), (2202: 2), (2203: 3), (2244: 4), (2296: 3), (2299: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 87 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
