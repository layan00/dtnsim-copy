The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1683(7 to 5), 1686(12 to 5), 1705(8 to 4), 1708(8 to 3), 1709(10 to 7), 1744(3 to 7), 1801(11 to 1), 1805(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1683: 60.000000), (1686: 10.000000), (1709: 70.000000), (1744: 0.000000), (1801: 20.000000), (1805: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1683: 6), (1686: 3), (1705: 2), (1708: 2), (1709: 4), (1744: 6), (1801: 3), (1805: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 56 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
