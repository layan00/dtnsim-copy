The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
251(7 to 5), 252(12 to 5), 271(8 to 4), 273(8 to 3), 274(10 to 7), 314(3 to 7), 369(11 to 1), 373(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(251: 60.000000), (252: 10.000000), (271: 120.000000), (273: 90.000000), (314: 0.000000), (369: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(251: 6), (252: 3), (271: 3), (273: 2), (274: 4), (314: 6), (369: 3), (373: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 73 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
