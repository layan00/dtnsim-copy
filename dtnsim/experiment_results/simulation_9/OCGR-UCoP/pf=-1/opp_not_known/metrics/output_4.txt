The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2175(7 to 5), 2181(12 to 5), 2200(8 to 4), 2203(8 to 3), 2204(10 to 7), 2238(3 to 7), 2283(11 to 1), 2287(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2175: 20.000000), (2181: 10.000000), (2200: 120.000000), (2203: 90.000000), (2283: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2175: 6), (2181: 3), (2200: 3), (2203: 2), (2204: 4), (2238: 1), (2283: 3), (2287: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 60 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
