The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1224(7 to 5), 1226(12 to 5), 1244(8 to 4), 1247(8 to 3), 1248(10 to 7), 1284(3 to 7), 1330(11 to 1), 1334(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1224: 40.000000), (1226: 10.000000), (1244: 120.000000), (1247: 90.000000), (1248: 70.000000), (1330: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1224: 5), (1226: 3), (1244: 4), (1247: 3), (1248: 4), (1284: 1), (1330: 3), (1334: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 81 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
