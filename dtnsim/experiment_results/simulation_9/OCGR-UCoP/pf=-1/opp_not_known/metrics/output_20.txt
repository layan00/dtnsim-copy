The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
261(7 to 5), 267(12 to 5), 286(8 to 4), 289(8 to 3), 290(10 to 7), 324(3 to 7), 380(11 to 1), 386(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 20.000000), (267: 10.000000), (324: 0.000000), (386: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(261: 6), (267: 3), (286: 2), (289: 2), (290: 7), (324: 6), (380: 3), (386: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 95 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
