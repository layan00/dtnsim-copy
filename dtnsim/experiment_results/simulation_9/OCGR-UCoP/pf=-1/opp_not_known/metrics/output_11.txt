The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
730(7 to 5), 732(12 to 5), 749(8 to 4), 751(8 to 3), 752(10 to 7), 789(3 to 7), 845(11 to 1), 848(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(732: 50.000000), (752: 10.000000), (789: 0.000000), (845: 20.000000), (848: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(730: 5), (732: 4), (749: 2), (751: 2), (752: 6), (789: 6), (845: 3), (848: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
