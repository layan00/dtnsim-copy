The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
259(7 to 5), 265(12 to 5), 285(8 to 4), 288(8 to 3), 289(10 to 7), 326(3 to 7), 381(11 to 1), 384(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(259: 20.000000), (265: 10.000000), (326: 0.000000), (381: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(259: 6), (265: 3), (285: 2), (288: 2), (289: 3), (326: 6), (381: 3), (384: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 58 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
