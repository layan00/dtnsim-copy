The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1209(7 to 5), 1210(12 to 5), 1229(8 to 4), 1231(8 to 3), 1232(10 to 7), 1267(3 to 7), 1317(11 to 1), 1321(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1210: 10.000000), (1317: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1209: 5), (1210: 3), (1229: 3), (1231: 3), (1232: 5), (1267: 1), (1317: 3), (1321: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
