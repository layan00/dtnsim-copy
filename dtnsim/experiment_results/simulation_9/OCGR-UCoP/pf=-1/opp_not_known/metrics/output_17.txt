The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1185(7 to 5), 1191(12 to 5), 1209(8 to 4), 1212(8 to 3), 1213(10 to 7), 1245(3 to 7), 1296(11 to 1), 1300(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1185: 20.000000), (1191: 10.000000), (1213: 70.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1185: 6), (1191: 3), (1209: 2), (1212: 2), (1213: 4), (1245: 4), (1296: 3), (1300: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 104 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
