The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
725(7 to 5), 731(12 to 5), 749(8 to 4), 752(8 to 3), 753(10 to 7), 785(3 to 7), 830(11 to 1), 834(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(725: 20.000000), (731: 10.000000), (752: 90.000000), (830: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(725: 6), (731: 3), (749: 4), (752: 3), (753: 4), (785: 1), (830: 3), (834: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 79 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
