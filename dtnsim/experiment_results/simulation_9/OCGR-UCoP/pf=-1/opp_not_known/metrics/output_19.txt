The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2134(7 to 5), 2136(12 to 5), 2156(8 to 4), 2158(8 to 3), 2159(10 to 7), 2195(3 to 7), 2247(11 to 1), 2251(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2136: 10.000000), (2158: 90.000000), (2247: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2134: 2), (2136: 3), (2156: 3), (2158: 2), (2159: 4), (2195: 4), (2247: 3), (2251: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 108 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
