The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
747(7 to 5), 753(12 to 5), 773(8 to 4), 776(8 to 3), 777(10 to 7), 812(3 to 7), 866(11 to 1), 870(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(747: 20.000000), (753: 10.000000), (776: 90.000000), (777: 70.000000), (812: 0.000000), (866: 20.000000), (870: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(747: 6), (753: 3), (773: 4), (776: 3), (777: 4), (812: 6), (866: 3), (870: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 55 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
