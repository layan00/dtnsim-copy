The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1210(7 to 5), 1211(12 to 5), 1231(8 to 4), 1233(8 to 3), 1234(10 to 7), 1269(3 to 7), 1318(11 to 1), 1322(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1211: 10.000000), (1231: 120.000000), (1233: 90.000000), (1322: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1210: 5), (1211: 3), (1231: 4), (1233: 3), (1234: 4), (1269: 1), (1318: 3), (1322: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
