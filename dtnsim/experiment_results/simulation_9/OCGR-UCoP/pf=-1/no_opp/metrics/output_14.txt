The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
851(7 to 5), 856(12 to 5), 864(8 to 4), 865(8 to 3), 866(10 to 7), 882(3 to 7), 897(11 to 1), 899(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(851: 60.000000), (856: 50.000000), (865: 90.000000), (899: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(851: 7), (856: 4), (864: 3), (865: 2), (866: 3), (882: 4), (897: 2), (899: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
