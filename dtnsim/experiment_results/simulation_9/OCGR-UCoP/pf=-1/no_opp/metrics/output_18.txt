The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
635(7 to 5), 636(12 to 5), 644(8 to 4), 645(8 to 3), 646(10 to 7), 659(3 to 7), 675(11 to 1), 679(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(636: 50.000000), (645: 90.000000), (646: 70.000000), (659: 55.000000), (679: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(635: 1), (636: 4), (644: 3), (645: 2), (646: 4), (659: 5), (675: 2), (679: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
