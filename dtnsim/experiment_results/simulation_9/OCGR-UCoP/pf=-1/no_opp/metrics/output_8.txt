The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
669(7 to 5), 674(12 to 5), 681(8 to 4), 682(8 to 3), 683(10 to 7), 698(3 to 7), 715(11 to 1), 719(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(669: 60.000000), (674: 50.000000), (715: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(669: 7), (674: 4), (681: 2), (682: 2), (683: 4), (698: 5), (715: 3), (719: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
