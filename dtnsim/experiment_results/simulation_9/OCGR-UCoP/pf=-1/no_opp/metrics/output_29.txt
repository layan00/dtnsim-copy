The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
871(7 to 5), 872(12 to 5), 881(8 to 4), 882(8 to 3), 883(10 to 7), 898(3 to 7), 914(11 to 1), 916(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(872: 50.000000), (881: 120.000000), (882: 90.000000), (914: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(871: 1), (872: 4), (881: 3), (882: 2), (883: 3), (898: 4), (914: 3), (916: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
