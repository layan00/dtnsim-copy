The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
665(7 to 5), 670(12 to 5), 678(8 to 4), 679(8 to 3), 680(10 to 7), 694(3 to 7), 706(11 to 1), 709(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(679: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(665: 7), (670: 4), (678: 4), (679: 3), (680: 4), (694: 2), (706: 2), (709: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
