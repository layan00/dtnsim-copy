The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
820(7 to 5), 822(12 to 5), 831(8 to 4), 832(8 to 3), 833(10 to 7), 847(3 to 7), 861(11 to 1), 864(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(832: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(820: 2), (822: 4), (831: 3), (832: 2), (833: 4), (847: 2), (861: 2), (864: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
