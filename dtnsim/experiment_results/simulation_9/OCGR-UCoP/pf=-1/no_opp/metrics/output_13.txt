The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
658(7 to 5), 661(12 to 5), 668(8 to 4), 670(8 to 3), 671(10 to 7), 685(3 to 7), 704(11 to 1), 708(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(658: 60.000000), (661: 50.000000), (671: 70.000000), (685: 55.000000), (704: 80.000000), (708: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(658: 6), (661: 5), (668: 2), (670: 2), (671: 4), (685: 5), (704: 3), (708: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
