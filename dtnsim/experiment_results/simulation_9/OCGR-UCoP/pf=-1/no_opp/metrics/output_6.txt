The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
300(7 to 5), 305(12 to 5), 314(8 to 4), 315(8 to 3), 316(10 to 7), 332(3 to 7), 351(11 to 1), 355(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(300: 60.000000), (305: 50.000000), (316: 70.000000), (332: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(300: 7), (305: 4), (314: 2), (315: 2), (316: 4), (332: 5), (351: 2), (355: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
