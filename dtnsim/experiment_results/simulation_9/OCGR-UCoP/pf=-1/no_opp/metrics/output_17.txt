The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
456(7 to 5), 461(12 to 5), 468(8 to 4), 469(8 to 3), 470(10 to 7), 482(3 to 7), 499(11 to 1), 503(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(456: 60.000000), (461: 50.000000), (470: 70.000000), (482: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(456: 7), (461: 4), (468: 2), (469: 2), (470: 4), (482: 5), (499: 2), (503: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
