The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
478(7 to 5), 479(12 to 5), 487(8 to 4), 488(8 to 3), 489(10 to 7), 498(3 to 7), 512(11 to 1), 515(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(512: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(478: 1), (479: 3), (487: 3), (488: 3), (489: 5), (498: 1), (512: 3), (515: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
