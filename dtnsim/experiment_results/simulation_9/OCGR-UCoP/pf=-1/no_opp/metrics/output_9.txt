The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
847(7 to 5), 848(12 to 5), 856(8 to 4), 857(8 to 3), 858(10 to 7), 871(3 to 7), 881(11 to 1), 884(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(858: 70.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(847: 1), (848: 3), (856: 2), (857: 2), (858: 4), (871: 1), (881: 2), (884: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
