The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
307(7 to 5), 312(12 to 5), 321(8 to 4), 322(8 to 3), 323(10 to 7), 337(3 to 7), 351(11 to 1), 352(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(307: 60.000000), (312: 50.000000), (321: 120.000000), (322: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(307: 7), (312: 4), (321: 4), (322: 3), (323: 3), (337: 4), (351: 1), (352: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
