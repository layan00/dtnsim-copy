The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
699(7 to 5), 704(12 to 5), 711(8 to 4), 712(8 to 3), 713(10 to 7), 721(3 to 7), 732(11 to 1), 734(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(711: 120.000000), (712: 90.000000), (732: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(699: 6), (704: 3), (711: 4), (712: 3), (713: 2), (721: 1), (732: 3), (734: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
