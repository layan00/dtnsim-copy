The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
291(7 to 5), 296(12 to 5), 303(8 to 4), 304(8 to 3), 305(10 to 7), 315(3 to 7), 324(11 to 1), 326(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(304: 90.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(291: 6), (296: 3), (303: 4), (304: 3), (305: 4), (315: 1), (324: 1), (326: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
