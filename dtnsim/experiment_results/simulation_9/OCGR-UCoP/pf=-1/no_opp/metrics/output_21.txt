The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
310(7 to 5), 312(12 to 5), 321(8 to 4), 322(8 to 3), 323(10 to 7), 335(3 to 7), 351(11 to 1), 353(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(312: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(310: 2), (312: 4), (321: 2), (322: 2), (323: 3), (335: 4), (351: 2), (353: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
