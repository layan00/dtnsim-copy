The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
125(7 to 5), 130(12 to 5), 139(8 to 4), 140(8 to 3), 141(10 to 7), 156(3 to 7), 172(11 to 1), 176(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(125: 60.000000), (130: 50.000000), (139: 120.000000), (140: 90.000000), (172: 80.000000), (176: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(125: 7), (130: 4), (139: 3), (140: 2), (141: 4), (156: 5), (172: 3), (176: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 52 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
