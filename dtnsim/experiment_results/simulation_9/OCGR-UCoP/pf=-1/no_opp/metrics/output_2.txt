The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
511(7 to 5), 516(12 to 5), 524(8 to 4), 525(8 to 3), 526(10 to 7), 538(3 to 7), 554(11 to 1), 558(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(511: 60.000000), (516: 50.000000), (524: 120.000000), (525: 90.000000), (526: 70.000000), (538: 55.000000), (554: 80.000000), (558: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(511: 7), (516: 4), (524: 4), (525: 3), (526: 4), (538: 5), (554: 3), (558: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
