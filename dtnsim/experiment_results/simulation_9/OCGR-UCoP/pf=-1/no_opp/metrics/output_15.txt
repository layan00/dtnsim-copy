The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
117(7 to 5), 120(12 to 5), 128(8 to 4), 130(8 to 3), 131(10 to 7), 140(3 to 7), 156(11 to 1), 160(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(117: 60.000000), (156: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(117: 6), (120: 2), (128: 2), (130: 2), (131: 4), (140: 5), (156: 3), (160: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
