The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
299(7 to 5), 301(12 to 5), 307(8 to 4), 308(8 to 3), 309(10 to 7), 317(3 to 7), 336(11 to 1), 340(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(301: 50.000000), (309: 70.000000), (317: 55.000000), (336: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(299: 2), (301: 4), (307: 2), (308: 2), (309: 5), (317: 5), (336: 3), (340: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
