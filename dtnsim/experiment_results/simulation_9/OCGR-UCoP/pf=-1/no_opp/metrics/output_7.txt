The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
489(7 to 5), 491(12 to 5), 498(8 to 4), 499(8 to 3), 500(10 to 7), 510(3 to 7), 520(11 to 1), 523(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(498: 120.000000), (499: 90.000000), (500: 70.000000), (520: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(489: 2), (491: 3), (498: 4), (499: 3), (500: 4), (510: 1), (520: 3), (523: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
