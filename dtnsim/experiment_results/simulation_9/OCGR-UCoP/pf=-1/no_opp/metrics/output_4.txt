The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
873(7 to 5), 877(12 to 5), 884(8 to 4), 885(8 to 3), 886(10 to 7), 900(3 to 7), 909(11 to 1), 912(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(884: 120.000000), (885: 90.000000), (909: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(873: 7), (877: 4), (884: 3), (885: 2), (886: 4), (900: 1), (909: 3), (912: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
