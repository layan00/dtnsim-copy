The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
673(7 to 5), 678(12 to 5), 686(8 to 4), 687(8 to 3), 688(10 to 7), 704(3 to 7), 721(11 to 1), 725(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(673: 60.000000), (678: 50.000000), (686: 120.000000), (687: 90.000000), (688: 70.000000), (704: 55.000000), (721: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(673: 7), (678: 4), (686: 3), (687: 2), (688: 4), (704: 5), (721: 3), (725: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
