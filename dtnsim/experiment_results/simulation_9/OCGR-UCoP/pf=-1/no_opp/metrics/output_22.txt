The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
483(7 to 5), 484(12 to 5), 492(8 to 4), 493(8 to 3), 494(10 to 7), 505(3 to 7), 520(11 to 1), 522(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(484: 50.000000), (492: 120.000000), (493: 90.000000), (520: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(483: 1), (484: 4), (492: 4), (493: 3), (494: 3), (505: 4), (520: 3), (522: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
