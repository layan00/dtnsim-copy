The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
851(7 to 5), 856(12 to 5), 864(8 to 4), 865(8 to 3), 866(10 to 7), 884(3 to 7), 900(11 to 1), 904(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(851: 60.000000), (856: 50.000000), (865: 90.000000), (866: 70.000000), (884: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(851: 7), (856: 4), (864: 3), (865: 2), (866: 4), (884: 5), (900: 2), (904: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
