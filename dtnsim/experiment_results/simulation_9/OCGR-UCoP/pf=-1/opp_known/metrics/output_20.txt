The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
257(7 to 5), 263(12 to 5), 272(8 to 4), 275(8 to 3), 276(10 to 7), 300(3 to 7), 331(11 to 1), 334(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(257: 20.000000), (263: 10.000000), (276: 10.000000), (300: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(257: 6), (263: 3), (272: 2), (275: 2), (276: 3), (300: 6), (331: 3), (334: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
