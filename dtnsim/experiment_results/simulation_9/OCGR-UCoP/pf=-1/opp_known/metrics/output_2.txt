The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1005(7 to 5), 1011(12 to 5), 1020(8 to 4), 1023(8 to 3), 1024(10 to 7), 1045(3 to 7), 1071(11 to 1), 1074(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1005: 20.000000), (1011: 10.000000), (1020: 120.000000), (1023: 90.000000), (1024: 10.000000), (1071: 20.000000), (1074: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1005: 6), (1011: 3), (1020: 4), (1023: 3), (1024: 3), (1045: 4), (1071: 3), (1074: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
