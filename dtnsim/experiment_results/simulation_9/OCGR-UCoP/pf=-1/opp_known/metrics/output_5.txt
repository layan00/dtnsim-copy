The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
248(7 to 5), 249(12 to 5), 257(8 to 4), 259(8 to 3), 260(10 to 7), 291(3 to 7), 322(11 to 1), 325(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 60.000000), (249: 10.000000), (257: 120.000000), (259: 90.000000), (260: 10.000000), (291: 0.000000), (325: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(248: 6), (249: 3), (257: 3), (259: 2), (260: 3), (291: 6), (322: 3), (325: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
