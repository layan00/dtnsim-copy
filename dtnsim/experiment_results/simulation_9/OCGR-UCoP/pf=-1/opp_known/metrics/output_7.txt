The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
991(7 to 5), 993(12 to 5), 1001(8 to 4), 1004(8 to 3), 1005(10 to 7), 1030(3 to 7), 1052(11 to 1), 1055(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(991: 40.000000), (993: 10.000000), (1001: 120.000000), (1004: 90.000000), (1005: 10.000000), (1052: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(991: 6), (993: 3), (1001: 4), (1004: 3), (1005: 3), (1030: 1), (1052: 3), (1055: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
