The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
633(7 to 5), 639(12 to 5), 649(8 to 4), 652(8 to 3), 653(10 to 7), 677(3 to 7), 707(11 to 1), 710(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(633: 20.000000), (639: 10.000000), (652: 90.000000), (653: 10.000000), (677: 0.000000), (707: 20.000000), (710: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(633: 6), (639: 3), (649: 4), (652: 3), (653: 3), (677: 6), (707: 3), (710: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
