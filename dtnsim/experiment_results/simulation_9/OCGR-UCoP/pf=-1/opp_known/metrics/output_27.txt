The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
993(7 to 5), 994(12 to 5), 1004(8 to 4), 1006(8 to 3), 1007(10 to 7), 1031(3 to 7), 1056(11 to 1), 1059(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(994: 10.000000), (1004: 120.000000), (1006: 90.000000), (1007: 10.000000), (1059: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(993: 5), (994: 3), (1004: 4), (1006: 3), (1007: 3), (1031: 1), (1056: 3), (1059: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
