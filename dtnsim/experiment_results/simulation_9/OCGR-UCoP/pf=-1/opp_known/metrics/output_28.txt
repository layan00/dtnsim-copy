The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1361(7 to 5), 1367(12 to 5), 1376(8 to 4), 1379(8 to 3), 1380(10 to 7), 1405(3 to 7), 1432(11 to 1), 1435(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1361: 20.000000), (1367: 10.000000), (1376: 120.000000), (1379: 90.000000), (1380: 10.000000), (1432: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1361: 6), (1367: 3), (1376: 3), (1379: 2), (1380: 3), (1405: 4), (1432: 3), (1435: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
