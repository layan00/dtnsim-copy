The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
622(7 to 5), 628(12 to 5), 638(8 to 4), 641(8 to 3), 642(10 to 7), 667(3 to 7), 699(11 to 1), 702(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(622: 20.000000), (628: 10.000000), (642: 10.000000), (667: 0.000000), (699: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(622: 6), (628: 3), (638: 2), (641: 3), (642: 3), (667: 6), (699: 3), (702: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
