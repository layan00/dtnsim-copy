The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1711(7 to 5), 1712(12 to 5), 1721(8 to 4), 1723(8 to 3), 1724(10 to 7), 1752(3 to 7), 1774(11 to 1), 1777(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1712: 10.000000), (1723: 130.000000), (1724: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1711: 5), (1712: 3), (1721: 2), (1723: 6), (1724: 3), (1752: 1), (1774: 3), (1777: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
