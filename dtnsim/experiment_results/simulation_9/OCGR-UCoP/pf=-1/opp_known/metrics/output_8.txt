The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1356(7 to 5), 1362(12 to 5), 1370(8 to 4), 1373(8 to 3), 1374(10 to 7), 1398(3 to 7), 1425(11 to 1), 1428(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1356: 20.000000), (1362: 10.000000), (1374: 10.000000), (1425: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1356: 6), (1362: 3), (1370: 2), (1373: 2), (1374: 3), (1398: 4), (1425: 3), (1428: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
