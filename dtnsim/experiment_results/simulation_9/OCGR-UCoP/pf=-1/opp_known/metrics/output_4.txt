The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1726(7 to 5), 1732(12 to 5), 1741(8 to 4), 1744(8 to 3), 1745(10 to 7), 1768(3 to 7), 1789(11 to 1), 1792(4 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1726: 20.000000), (1732: 10.000000), (1741: 120.000000), (1744: 90.000000), (1745: 10.000000), (1789: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1726: 6), (1732: 3), (1741: 3), (1744: 2), (1745: 3), (1768: 1), (1789: 3), (1792: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
