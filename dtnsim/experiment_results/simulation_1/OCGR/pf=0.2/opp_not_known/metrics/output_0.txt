The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(10 to 6), 246(1 to 11), 253(1 to 6), 254(5 to 10), 284(4 to 1), 288(9 to 12), 313(3 to 9), 346(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 35.000000), (253: 15.000000), (254: 35.000000), (284: 140.000000), (288: 0.000000), (346: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 1), (246: 3), (253: 3), (254: 3), (284: 6), (288: 3), (313: 2), (346: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
