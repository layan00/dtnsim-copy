The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
673(10 to 6), 690(1 to 11), 697(1 to 6), 698(5 to 10), 728(4 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/5) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(673: 3), (690: 2), (697: 1), (698: 2), (728: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 9 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 690: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 697: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 673: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), 
Bundle 698: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 728: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 673: (to: 12, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 698: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 673: (to: 4, time: 0.000000),
