The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(10 to 6), 90(1 to 11), 97(1 to 6), 98(5 to 10), 104(4 to 1), 106(9 to 12), 118(3 to 9), 125(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(90: 35.000000), (97: 25.000000), (98: 35.000000), (125: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 1), (90: 3), (97: 2), (98: 3), (104: 1), (106: 2), (118: 2), (125: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
