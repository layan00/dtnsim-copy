The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
554(10 to 6), 558(1 to 11), 567(1 to 6), 568(5 to 10), 590(4 to 1), 595(9 to 12), 610(3 to 9), 642(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(558: 65.000000), (567: 25.000000), (568: 35.000000), (590: 140.000000), (595: 0.000000), (610: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(558: 10), (567: 2), (568: 5), (590: 6), (595: 4), (610: 7), (642: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
