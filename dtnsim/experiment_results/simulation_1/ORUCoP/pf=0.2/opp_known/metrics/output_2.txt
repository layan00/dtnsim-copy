The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
916(10 to 6), 922(1 to 11), 930(1 to 6), 931(5 to 10), 953(4 to 1), 961(9 to 12), 977(3 to 9), 1006(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(922: 35.000000), (930: 25.000000), (931: 35.000000), (953: 140.000000), (961: 0.000000), (977: 15.000000), (1006: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(922: 8), (930: 4), (931: 5), (953: 6), (961: 4), (977: 6), (1006: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
