The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
560(10 to 6), 565(1 to 11), 574(1 to 6), 575(5 to 10), 598(4 to 1), 606(9 to 12), 622(3 to 9), 657(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(565: 65.000000), (574: 25.000000), (575: 35.000000), (598: 60.000000), (606: 0.000000), (622: 15.000000), (657: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(565: 10), (574: 2), (575: 11), (598: 8), (606: 4), (622: 7), (657: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
