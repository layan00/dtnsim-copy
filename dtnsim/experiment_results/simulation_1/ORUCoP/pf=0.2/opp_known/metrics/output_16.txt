The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
543(10 to 6), 549(1 to 11), 555(1 to 6), 556(5 to 10), 575(4 to 1), 579(9 to 12), 603(3 to 9), 630(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(549: 35.000000), (556: 55.000000), (575: 60.000000), (579: 55.000000), (603: 15.000000), (630: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(549: 3), (555: 1), (556: 12), (575: 8), (579: 6), (603: 7), (630: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
