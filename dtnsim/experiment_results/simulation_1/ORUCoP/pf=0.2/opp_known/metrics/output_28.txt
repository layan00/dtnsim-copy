The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1235(10 to 6), 1239(1 to 11), 1248(1 to 6), 1249(5 to 10), 1272(4 to 1), 1281(9 to 12), 1295(3 to 9), 1331(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1239: 65.000000), (1248: 25.000000), (1249: 35.000000), (1272: 140.000000), (1281: 0.000000), (1295: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1239: 10), (1248: 4), (1249: 10), (1272: 8), (1281: 4), (1295: 10), (1331: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
