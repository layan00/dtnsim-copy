The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
564(10 to 6), 569(1 to 11), 577(1 to 6), 578(5 to 10), 602(4 to 1), 611(9 to 12), 623(3 to 9), 659(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(569: 65.000000), (577: 25.000000), (578: 35.000000), (602: 60.000000), (611: 0.000000), (623: 15.000000), (659: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(569: 10), (577: 3), (578: 10), (602: 8), (611: 4), (623: 10), (659: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
