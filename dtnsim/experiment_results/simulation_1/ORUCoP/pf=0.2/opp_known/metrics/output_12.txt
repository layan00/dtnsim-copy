The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
861(10 to 6), 865(1 to 11), 871(1 to 6), 872(5 to 10), 896(4 to 1), 905(9 to 12), 920(3 to 9), 950(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(865: 65.000000), (871: 25.000000), (872: 35.000000), (896: 140.000000), (905: 0.000000), (920: 55.000000), (950: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(865: 11), (871: 3), (872: 11), (896: 6), (905: 4), (920: 6), (950: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
