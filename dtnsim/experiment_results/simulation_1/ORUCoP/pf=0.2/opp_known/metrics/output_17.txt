The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
877(10 to 6), 881(1 to 11), 889(1 to 6), 890(5 to 10), 910(4 to 1), 914(9 to 12), 934(3 to 9), 963(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(881: 35.000000), (889: 25.000000), (914: 55.000000), (934: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(881: 6), (889: 2), (890: 4), (910: 5), (914: 6), (934: 7), (963: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
