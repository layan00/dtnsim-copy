The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
890(10 to 6), 897(1 to 11), 905(1 to 6), 906(5 to 10), 931(4 to 1), 941(9 to 12), 959(3 to 9), 991(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(897: 35.000000), (905: 25.000000), (906: 35.000000), (931: 140.000000), (941: 0.000000), (959: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(897: 8), (905: 4), (906: 11), (931: 7), (941: 4), (959: 7), (991: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
