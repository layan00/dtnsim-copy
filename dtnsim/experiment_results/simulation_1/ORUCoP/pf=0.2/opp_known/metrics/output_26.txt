The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
546(10 to 6), 552(1 to 11), 560(1 to 6), 561(5 to 10), 584(4 to 1), 594(9 to 12), 613(3 to 9), 639(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(552: 35.000000), (560: 25.000000), (561: 55.000000), (584: 140.000000), (594: 0.000000), (613: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(552: 5), (560: 4), (561: 11), (584: 7), (594: 4), (613: 7), (639: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
