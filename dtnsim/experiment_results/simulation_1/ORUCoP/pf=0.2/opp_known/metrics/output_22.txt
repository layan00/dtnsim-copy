The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
884(10 to 6), 891(1 to 11), 899(1 to 6), 900(5 to 10), 925(4 to 1), 935(9 to 12), 950(3 to 9), 980(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(891: 35.000000), (899: 25.000000), (900: 35.000000), (935: 0.000000), (950: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(891: 7), (899: 3), (900: 11), (925: 5), (935: 4), (950: 6), (980: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
