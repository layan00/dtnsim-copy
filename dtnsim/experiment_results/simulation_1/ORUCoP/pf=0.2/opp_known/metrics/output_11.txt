The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
526(10 to 6), 531(1 to 11), 537(1 to 6), 538(5 to 10), 558(4 to 1), 566(9 to 12), 574(3 to 9), 611(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(531: 65.000000), (537: 25.000000), (538: 35.000000), (558: 60.000000), (566: 55.000000), (574: 15.000000), (611: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(531: 8), (537: 4), (538: 4), (558: 7), (566: 6), (574: 10), (611: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
