The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(10 to 6), 218(1 to 11), 228(1 to 6), 229(5 to 10), 254(4 to 1), 263(9 to 12), 284(3 to 9), 311(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 35.000000), (228: 25.000000), (229: 35.000000), (254: 140.000000), (263: 0.000000), (284: 15.000000), (311: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 8), (228: 4), (229: 11), (254: 6), (263: 6), (284: 5), (311: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 111 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
