The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(10 to 6), 229(1 to 11), 235(1 to 6), 236(5 to 10), 269(4 to 1), 276(9 to 12), 310(3 to 9), 354(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 95.000000), (235: 25.000000), (269: 60.000000), (276: 0.000000), (310: 15.000000), (354: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(229: 8), (235: 6), (236: 12), (269: 5), (276: 5), (310: 7), (354: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 201 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
