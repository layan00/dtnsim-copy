The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
689(10 to 6), 708(1 to 11), 718(1 to 6), 719(5 to 10), 752(4 to 1), 756(9 to 12), 786(3 to 9), 828(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(689: 45.000000), (718: 25.000000), (719: 35.000000), (752: 140.000000), (756: 0.000000), (786: 15.000000), (828: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(689: 6), (718: 2), (719: 6), (752: 6), (756: 5), (786: 7), (828: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 159 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
