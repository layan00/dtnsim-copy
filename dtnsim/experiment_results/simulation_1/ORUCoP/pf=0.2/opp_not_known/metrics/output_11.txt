The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(10 to 6), 683(1 to 11), 691(1 to 6), 692(5 to 10), 723(4 to 1), 729(9 to 12), 751(3 to 9), 790(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(664: 105.000000), (691: 25.000000), (692: 55.000000), (723: 60.000000), (729: 55.000000), (751: 65.000000), (790: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(664: 8), (683: 2), (691: 3), (692: 8), (723: 5), (729: 6), (751: 6), (790: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 211 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
