The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1151(10 to 6), 1171(1 to 11), 1180(1 to 6), 1181(5 to 10), 1215(4 to 1), 1218(9 to 12), 1252(3 to 9), 1295(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1151: 105.000000), (1171: 35.000000), (1180: 25.000000), (1181: 35.000000), (1215: 140.000000), (1218: 0.000000), (1252: 15.000000), (1295: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1151: 8), (1171: 6), (1180: 4), (1181: 6), (1215: 8), (1218: 5), (1252: 7), (1295: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 180 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
