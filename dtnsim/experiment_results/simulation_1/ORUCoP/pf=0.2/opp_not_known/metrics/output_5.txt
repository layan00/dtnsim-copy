The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(10 to 6), 240(1 to 11), 252(1 to 6), 253(5 to 10), 287(4 to 1), 292(9 to 12), 328(3 to 9), 365(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 45.000000), (240: 35.000000), (252: 25.000000), (253: 35.000000), (287: 140.000000), (292: 0.000000), (328: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 6), (240: 6), (252: 4), (253: 5), (287: 6), (292: 6), (328: 7), (365: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
