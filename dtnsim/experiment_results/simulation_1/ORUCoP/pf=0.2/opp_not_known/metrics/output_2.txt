The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1143(10 to 6), 1161(1 to 11), 1169(1 to 6), 1170(5 to 10), 1201(4 to 1), 1205(9 to 12), 1241(3 to 9), 1278(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1161: 35.000000), (1169: 25.000000), (1170: 35.000000), (1201: 140.000000), (1205: 0.000000), (1241: 65.000000), (1278: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1161: 6), (1169: 4), (1170: 6), (1201: 8), (1205: 6), (1241: 5), (1278: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 175 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
