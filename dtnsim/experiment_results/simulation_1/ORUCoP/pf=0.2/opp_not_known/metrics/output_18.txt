The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1592(10 to 6), 1612(1 to 11), 1623(1 to 6), 1624(5 to 10), 1656(4 to 1), 1660(9 to 12), 1696(3 to 9), 1734(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1592: 45.000000), (1612: 35.000000), (1623: 25.000000), (1624: 35.000000), (1656: 140.000000), (1660: 0.000000), (1696: 15.000000), (1734: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1592: 6), (1612: 6), (1623: 2), (1624: 6), (1656: 5), (1660: 6), (1696: 7), (1734: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
