The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(10 to 6), 242(1 to 11), 254(1 to 6), 255(5 to 10), 290(4 to 1), 296(9 to 12), 327(3 to 9), 361(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(222: 45.000000), (242: 35.000000), (254: 25.000000), (255: 35.000000), (290: 140.000000), (296: 0.000000), (327: 65.000000), (361: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 6), (242: 4), (254: 3), (255: 6), (290: 8), (296: 6), (327: 6), (361: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 213 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
