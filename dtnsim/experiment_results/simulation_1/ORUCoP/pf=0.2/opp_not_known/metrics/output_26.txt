The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
669(10 to 6), 689(1 to 11), 700(1 to 6), 701(5 to 10), 736(4 to 1), 742(9 to 12), 780(3 to 9), 815(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(669: 45.000000), (689: 35.000000), (700: 25.000000), (701: 55.000000), (736: 140.000000), (742: 0.000000), (780: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(669: 6), (689: 6), (700: 4), (701: 9), (736: 8), (742: 6), (780: 7), (815: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 207 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
