The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
672(10 to 6), 692(1 to 11), 699(1 to 6), 700(5 to 10), 732(4 to 1), 735(9 to 12), 772(3 to 9), 813(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(672: 105.000000), (692: 35.000000), (700: 55.000000), (735: 55.000000), (772: 15.000000), (813: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(672: 8), (692: 6), (699: 1), (700: 12), (732: 6), (735: 7), (772: 7), (813: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 187 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
