The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(10 to 6), 242(1 to 11), 251(1 to 6), 252(5 to 10), 286(4 to 1), 289(9 to 12), 323(3 to 9), 359(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 35.000000), (251: 25.000000), (252: 35.000000), (286: 140.000000), (289: 0.000000), (323: 65.000000), (359: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(242: 6), (251: 4), (252: 6), (286: 8), (289: 4), (323: 5), (359: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 167 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
