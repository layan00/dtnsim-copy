The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
684(10 to 6), 703(1 to 11), 712(1 to 6), 713(5 to 10), 747(4 to 1), 754(9 to 12), 782(3 to 9), 819(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(684: 45.000000), (712: 25.000000), (713: 35.000000), (747: 140.000000), (754: 0.000000), (782: 65.000000), (819: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(684: 6), (703: 2), (712: 3), (713: 6), (747: 5), (754: 5), (782: 9), (819: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 197 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
