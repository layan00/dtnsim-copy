The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
79(10 to 6), 86(1 to 11), 95(1 to 6), 96(5 to 10), 103(4 to 1), 105(9 to 12), 116(3 to 9), 122(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(86: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(86: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 15 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 86: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 25.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 86: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 86: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5:
