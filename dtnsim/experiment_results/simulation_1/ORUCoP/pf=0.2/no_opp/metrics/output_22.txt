The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
360(10 to 6), 367(1 to 11), 374(1 to 6), 375(5 to 10), 384(4 to 1), 388(9 to 12), 402(3 to 9), 413(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(367: 35.000000), (374: 25.000000), (375: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(367: 4), (374: 3), (375: 3), (384: 6), (388: 1), (402: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
