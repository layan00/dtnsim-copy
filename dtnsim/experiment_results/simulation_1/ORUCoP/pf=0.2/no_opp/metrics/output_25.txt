The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
72(10 to 6), 78(1 to 11), 84(1 to 6), 85(5 to 10), 92(4 to 1), 94(9 to 12), 109(3 to 9), 119(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(84: 25.000000), (85: 35.000000), (92: 140.000000), (119: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 2), (85: 3), (92: 8), (94: 2), (109: 1), (119: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
