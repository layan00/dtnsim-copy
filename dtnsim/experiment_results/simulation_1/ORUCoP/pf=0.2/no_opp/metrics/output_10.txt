The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(10 to 6), 76(1 to 11), 82(1 to 6), 83(5 to 10), 89(4 to 1), 94(9 to 12), 107(3 to 9), 117(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 25.000000), (94: 55.000000), (117: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(76: 2), (82: 3), (89: 4), (94: 4), (107: 2), (117: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 76: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
