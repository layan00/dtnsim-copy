The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
701(10 to 6), 705(1 to 11), 711(1 to 6), 712(5 to 10), 719(4 to 1), 721(9 to 12), 734(3 to 9), 743(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(711: 25.000000), (719: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(711: 2), (719: 8), (721: 2), (734: 1), (743: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 711: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 711: (to: 6, time: 60.000000),
