The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
363(10 to 6), 370(1 to 11), 377(1 to 6), 378(5 to 10), 387(4 to 1), 391(9 to 12), 410(3 to 9), 424(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(370: 35.000000), (377: 25.000000), (378: 35.000000), (387: 140.000000), (391: 55.000000), (410: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(370: 6), (377: 4), (378: 3), (387: 8), (391: 4), (410: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
