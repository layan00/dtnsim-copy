The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
219(10 to 6), 225(1 to 11), 231(1 to 6), 232(5 to 10), 238(4 to 1), 240(9 to 12), 254(3 to 9), 263(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 35.000000), (240: 55.000000), (263: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 3), (231: 1), (238: 6), (240: 4), (254: 8), (263: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
