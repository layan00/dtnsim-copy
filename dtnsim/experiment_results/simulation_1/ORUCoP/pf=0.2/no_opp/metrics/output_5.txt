The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
76(10 to 6), 82(1 to 11), 91(1 to 6), 92(5 to 10), 100(4 to 1), 104(9 to 12), 122(3 to 9), 133(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 35.000000), (91: 25.000000), (92: 35.000000), (100: 140.000000), (122: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(82: 6), (91: 4), (92: 3), (100: 8), (122: 4), (133: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
