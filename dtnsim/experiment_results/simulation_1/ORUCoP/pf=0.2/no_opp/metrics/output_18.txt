The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
492(10 to 6), 498(1 to 11), 506(1 to 6), 507(5 to 10), 514(4 to 1), 516(9 to 12), 531(3 to 9), 542(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(498: 35.000000), (506: 25.000000), (507: 35.000000), (514: 140.000000), (542: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(498: 3), (506: 2), (507: 3), (514: 8), (531: 8), (542: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
