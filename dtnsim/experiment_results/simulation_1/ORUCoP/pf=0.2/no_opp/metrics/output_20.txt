The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
78(10 to 6), 84(1 to 11), 93(1 to 6), 94(5 to 10), 103(4 to 1), 107(9 to 12), 121(3 to 9), 130(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(84: 35.000000), (93: 25.000000), (94: 35.000000), (103: 140.000000), (121: 65.000000), (130: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 4), (93: 3), (94: 3), (103: 8), (107: 1), (121: 5), (130: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
