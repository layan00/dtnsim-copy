The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
388(10 to 6), 394(1 to 11), 402(1 to 6), 403(5 to 10), 412(4 to 1), 416(9 to 12), 434(3 to 9), 447(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(394: 35.000000), (402: 25.000000), (403: 35.000000), (412: 140.000000), (416: 55.000000), (447: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(394: 6), (402: 4), (403: 3), (412: 8), (416: 4), (434: 8), (447: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
