The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
388(10 to 6), 394(1 to 11), 401(1 to 6), 402(5 to 10), 408(4 to 1), 413(9 to 12), 430(3 to 9), 441(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(394: 35.000000), (401: 25.000000), (402: 35.000000), (408: 140.000000), (430: 65.000000), (441: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(394: 6), (401: 4), (402: 3), (408: 8), (430: 5), (441: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
