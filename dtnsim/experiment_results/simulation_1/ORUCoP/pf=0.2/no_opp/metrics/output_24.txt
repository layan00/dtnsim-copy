The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
656(10 to 6), 663(1 to 11), 671(1 to 6), 672(5 to 10), 680(4 to 1), 684(9 to 12), 701(3 to 9), 714(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(663: 35.000000), (671: 25.000000), (684: 55.000000), (714: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(663: 6), (671: 3), (680: 6), (684: 4), (701: 8), (714: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
