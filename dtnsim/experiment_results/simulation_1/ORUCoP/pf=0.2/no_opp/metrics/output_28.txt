The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
516(10 to 6), 520(1 to 11), 528(1 to 6), 529(5 to 10), 537(4 to 1), 542(9 to 12), 551(3 to 9), 560(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(528: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(520: 2), (528: 4), (529: 1), (537: 6), (551: 8), (560: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
