The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
79(10 to 6), 86(1 to 11), 95(1 to 6), 96(5 to 10), 105(4 to 1), 108(9 to 12), 127(3 to 9), 139(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(86: 35.000000), (95: 25.000000), (96: 35.000000), (105: 140.000000), (127: 65.000000), (139: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(86: 6), (95: 4), (96: 3), (105: 8), (108: 2), (127: 5), (139: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
