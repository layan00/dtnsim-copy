The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
326(10 to 6), 330(1 to 11), 335(1 to 6), 336(5 to 10), 345(4 to 1), 350(9 to 12), 365(3 to 9), 375(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(330: 35.000000), (335: 25.000000), (336: 35.000000), (345: 140.000000), (365: 65.000000), (375: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(330: 4), (335: 3), (336: 3), (345: 8), (350: 2), (365: 5), (375: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
