The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
502(10 to 6), 508(1 to 11), 517(1 to 6), 518(5 to 10), 527(4 to 1), 531(9 to 12), 540(3 to 9), 551(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 25.000000), (531: 55.000000), (540: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(508: 2), (517: 3), (518: 1), (527: 4), (531: 4), (540: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
