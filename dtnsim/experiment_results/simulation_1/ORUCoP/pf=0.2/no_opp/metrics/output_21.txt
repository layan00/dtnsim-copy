The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(10 to 6), 229(1 to 11), 237(1 to 6), 238(5 to 10), 245(4 to 1), 247(9 to 12), 262(3 to 9), 274(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(237: 25.000000), (238: 35.000000), (245: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 2), (238: 3), (245: 8), (247: 3), (262: 3), (274: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
