The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(10 to 6), 203(1 to 11), 209(1 to 6), 210(5 to 10), 216(4 to 1), 222(9 to 12), 228(3 to 9), 237(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 25.000000), (216: 60.000000), (237: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 2), (209: 3), (210: 1), (216: 8), (237: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 203: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
