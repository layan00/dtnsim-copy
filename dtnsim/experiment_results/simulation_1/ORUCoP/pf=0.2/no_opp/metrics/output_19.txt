The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
637(10 to 6), 642(1 to 11), 650(1 to 6), 651(5 to 10), 659(4 to 1), 661(9 to 12), 678(3 to 9), 687(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(642: 35.000000), (650: 25.000000), (651: 35.000000), (659: 140.000000), (678: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(642: 3), (650: 2), (651: 3), (659: 8), (661: 2), (678: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
