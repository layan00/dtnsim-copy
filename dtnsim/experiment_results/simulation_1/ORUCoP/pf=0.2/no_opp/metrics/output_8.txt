The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
553(10 to 6), 560(1 to 11), 569(1 to 6), 570(5 to 10), 578(4 to 1), 582(9 to 12), 600(3 to 9), 612(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(560: 35.000000), (569: 25.000000), (570: 35.000000), (612: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(560: 6), (569: 4), (570: 3), (578: 6), (600: 8), (612: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
