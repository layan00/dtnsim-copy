The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
536(10 to 6), 541(1 to 11), 548(1 to 6), 549(5 to 10), 556(4 to 1), 561(9 to 12), 571(3 to 9), 580(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(548: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(541: 2), (548: 4), (556: 6), (571: 8), (580: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
