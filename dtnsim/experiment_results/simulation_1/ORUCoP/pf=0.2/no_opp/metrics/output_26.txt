The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(10 to 6), 218(1 to 11), 226(1 to 6), 227(5 to 10), 236(4 to 1), 240(9 to 12), 260(3 to 9), 268(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 35.000000), (226: 25.000000), (227: 55.000000), (236: 140.000000), (240: 55.000000), (260: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 6), (226: 4), (227: 3), (236: 8), (240: 4), (260: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
