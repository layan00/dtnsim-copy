The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
231(10 to 6), 236(1 to 11), 244(1 to 6), 245(5 to 10), 253(4 to 1), 255(9 to 12), 269(3 to 9), 283(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(244: 25.000000), (245: 35.000000), (253: 140.000000), (255: 55.000000), (283: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(244: 2), (245: 3), (253: 8), (255: 4), (269: 8), (283: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
