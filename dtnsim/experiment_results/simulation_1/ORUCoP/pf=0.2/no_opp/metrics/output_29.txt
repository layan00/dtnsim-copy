The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
662(10 to 6), 667(1 to 11), 675(1 to 6), 676(5 to 10), 684(4 to 1), 688(9 to 12), 708(3 to 9), 722(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(667: 35.000000), (675: 25.000000), (676: 35.000000), (722: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(667: 6), (675: 4), (676: 3), (684: 6), (688: 3), (708: 4), (722: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
