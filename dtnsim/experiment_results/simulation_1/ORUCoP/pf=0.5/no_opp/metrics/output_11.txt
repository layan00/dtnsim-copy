The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
146(10 to 6), 149(1 to 11), 154(1 to 6), 155(5 to 10), 161(4 to 1), 166(9 to 12), 170(3 to 9), 177(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(161: 60.000000), (177: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(149: 1), (154: 2), (155: 1), (161: 4), (177: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
