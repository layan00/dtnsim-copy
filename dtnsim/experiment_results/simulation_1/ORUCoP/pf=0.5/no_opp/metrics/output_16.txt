The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
138(10 to 6), 141(1 to 11), 145(1 to 6), 146(5 to 10), 151(4 to 1), 153(9 to 12), 157(3 to 9), 165(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(151: 60.000000), (157: 65.000000), (165: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(145: 1), (151: 4), (157: 6), (165: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
