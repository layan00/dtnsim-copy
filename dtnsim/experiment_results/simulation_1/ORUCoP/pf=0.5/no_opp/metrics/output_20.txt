The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
61(10 to 6), 67(1 to 11), 76(1 to 6), 77(5 to 10), 86(4 to 1), 90(9 to 12), 99(3 to 9), 106(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(76: 25.000000), (77: 35.000000), (99: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(67: 2), (76: 3), (77: 3), (86: 2), (90: 1), (99: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 67: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

Node 2: 
Bundle 76: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 99: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 77: (to: 11, time: 60.000000),
