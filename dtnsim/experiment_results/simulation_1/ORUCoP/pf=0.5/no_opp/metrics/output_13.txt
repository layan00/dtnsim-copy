The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
342(10 to 6), 349(1 to 11), 354(1 to 6), 355(5 to 10), 361(4 to 1), 366(9 to 12), 378(3 to 9), 389(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(354: 25.000000), (366: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(349: 4), (354: 6), (355: 1), (361: 3), (366: 4), (378: 4), (389: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
