The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
161(10 to 6), 164(1 to 11), 169(1 to 6), 170(5 to 10), 175(4 to 1), 177(9 to 12), 187(3 to 9), 194(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(175: 4), (177: 2), (187: 1), (194: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 187: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 175: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 11, time: 60.000000),
