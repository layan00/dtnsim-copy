The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
328(10 to 6), 332(1 to 11), 337(1 to 6), 338(5 to 10), 344(4 to 1), 346(9 to 12), 354(3 to 9), 365(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(365: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(337: 1), (344: 6), (354: 3), (365: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
