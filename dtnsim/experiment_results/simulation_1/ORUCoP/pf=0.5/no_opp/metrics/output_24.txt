The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
438(10 to 6), 443(1 to 11), 448(1 to 6), 449(5 to 10), 454(4 to 1), 456(9 to 12), 462(3 to 9), 474(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(462: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(448: 1), (454: 4), (462: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 448: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 462: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000),
