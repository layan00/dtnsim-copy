The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
141(10 to 6), 145(1 to 11), 149(1 to 6), 150(5 to 10), 156(4 to 1), 158(9 to 12), 165(3 to 9), 177(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(156: 1), (158: 3), (165: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 165: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000),
