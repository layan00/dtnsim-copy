The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
231(10 to 6), 235(1 to 11), 239(1 to 6), 240(5 to 10), 248(4 to 1), 252(9 to 12), 263(3 to 9), 275(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 35.000000), (239: 25.000000), (240: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(235: 3), (239: 3), (240: 3), (248: 6), (263: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
