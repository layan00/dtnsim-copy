The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
318(10 to 6), 323(1 to 11), 329(1 to 6), 330(5 to 10), 338(4 to 1), 342(9 to 12), 348(3 to 9), 354(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(330: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(323: 1), (329: 2), (330: 3), (338: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 323: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 329: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 330: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 338: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 330: (to: 4, time: 35.000000),
