The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
133(10 to 6), 137(1 to 11), 143(1 to 6), 144(5 to 10), 152(4 to 1), 156(9 to 12), 165(3 to 9), 171(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(143: 25.000000), (144: 55.000000), (152: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(137: 2), (143: 3), (144: 3), (152: 5), (156: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 137: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
