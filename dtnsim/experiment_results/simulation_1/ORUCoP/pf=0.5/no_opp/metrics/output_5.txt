The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
46(10 to 6), 48(1 to 11), 54(1 to 6), 55(5 to 10), 61(4 to 1), 65(9 to 12), 73(3 to 9), 78(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(54: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(48: 2), (54: 3), (73: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 48: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 54: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 54: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 48: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 73: (to: 4, time: 65.000000),
