The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
453(10 to 6), 457(1 to 11), 462(1 to 6), 463(5 to 10), 470(4 to 1), 472(9 to 12), 480(3 to 9), 486(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(462: 25.000000), (486: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(462: 2), (463: 1), (472: 1), (480: 1), (486: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 462: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 462: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 480: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 463: (to: 4, time: 35.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 486: (to: 1, time: 110.000000), (to: 1, time: 110.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 472: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 486: (to: 6, time: 110.000000), (to: 6, time: 110.000000),
