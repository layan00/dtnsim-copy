The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
338(10 to 6), 342(1 to 11), 348(1 to 6), 349(5 to 10), 355(4 to 1), 357(9 to 12), 363(3 to 9), 370(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(348: 1), (349: 1), (355: 3), (370: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 348: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 355: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 349: (to: 4, time: 35.000000), 
Bundle 355: (to: 12, time: 110.000000),
