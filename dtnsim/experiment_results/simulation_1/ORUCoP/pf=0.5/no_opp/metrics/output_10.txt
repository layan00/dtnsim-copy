The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
52(10 to 6), 57(1 to 11), 62(1 to 6), 63(5 to 10), 68(4 to 1), 73(9 to 12), 77(3 to 9), 82(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(62: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(57: 1), (62: 4), (77: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 57: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 62: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 62: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Bundle 77: (to: 6, time: 100.000000),
