The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
427(10 to 6), 431(1 to 11), 438(1 to 6), 439(5 to 10), 446(4 to 1), 448(9 to 12), 459(3 to 9), 463(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(431: 35.000000), (459: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(431: 3), (438: 1), (439: 2), (446: 2), (459: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
