The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
47(10 to 6), 51(1 to 11), 56(1 to 6), 57(5 to 10), 62(4 to 1), 64(9 to 12), 68(3 to 9), 75(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(62: 60.000000), (68: 65.000000), (75: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(62: 4), (64: 1), (68: 4), (75: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
