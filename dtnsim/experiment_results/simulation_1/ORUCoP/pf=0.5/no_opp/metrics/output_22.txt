The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
248(10 to 6), 252(1 to 11), 257(1 to 6), 258(5 to 10), 265(4 to 1), 270(9 to 12), 276(3 to 9), 281(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(257: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(252: 2), (257: 4), (265: 3), (270: 1), (276: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 252: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
