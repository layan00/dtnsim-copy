The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
231(10 to 6), 234(1 to 11), 240(1 to 6), 241(5 to 10), 246(4 to 1), 248(9 to 12), 261(3 to 9), 269(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 35.000000), (240: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(234: 3), (240: 2), (246: 2), (261: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 234: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), 
Bundle 240: (to: 2, time: 35.000000),
