The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
403(10 to 6), 406(1 to 11), 410(1 to 6), 411(5 to 10), 417(4 to 1), 419(9 to 12), 425(3 to 9), 430(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(410: 1), (417: 3), (430: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 410: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 417: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 417: (to: 7, time: 160.000000), 
Node 11: 
Bundle 417: (to: 10, time: 70.000000), 
Node 12: 
Bundle 430: (to: 6, time: 110.000000), (to: 6, time: 110.000000), 
Node 13: 
Node 14:
