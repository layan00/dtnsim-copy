The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
57(10 to 6), 62(1 to 11), 70(1 to 6), 71(5 to 10), 81(4 to 1), 85(9 to 12), 95(3 to 9), 103(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(70: 25.000000), (71: 35.000000), (81: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(62: 2), (70: 3), (71: 6), (81: 4), (85: 1), (95: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 98 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 62: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

Bundle 81: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 71: (to: 4, time: 35.000000), (to: 4, time: 35.000000),
