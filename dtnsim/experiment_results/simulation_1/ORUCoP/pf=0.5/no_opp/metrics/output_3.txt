The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
319(10 to 6), 323(1 to 11), 329(1 to 6), 330(5 to 10), 336(4 to 1), 340(9 to 12), 349(3 to 9), 354(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(329: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(323: 1), (329: 4), (336: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 323: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 329: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 329: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 329: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 336: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 336: (to: 7, time: 160.000000), 
Node 11: 
Bundle 336: (to: 10, time: 70.000000), 
Node 12:
