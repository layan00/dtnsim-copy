The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
434(10 to 6), 438(1 to 11), 444(1 to 6), 445(5 to 10), 452(4 to 1), 457(9 to 12), 472(3 to 9), 484(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(438: 35.000000), (445: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(438: 6), (444: 4), (445: 3), (452: 6), (457: 1), (472: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
