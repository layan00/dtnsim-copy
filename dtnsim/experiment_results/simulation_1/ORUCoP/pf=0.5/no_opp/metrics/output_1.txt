The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
158(10 to 6), 160(1 to 11), 165(1 to 6), 166(5 to 10), 172(4 to 1), 174(9 to 12), 185(3 to 9), 191(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(165: 25.000000), (174: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(165: 2), (172: 2), (174: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 165: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 165: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 172: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 174: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 174: (to: 12, time: 110.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 174: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9:
