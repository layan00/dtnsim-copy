The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
42(10 to 6), 45(1 to 11), 50(1 to 6), 51(5 to 10), 57(4 to 1), 59(9 to 12), 70(3 to 9), 74(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(50: 1), (51: 2), (57: 2), (59: 2), (70: 1), (74: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 50: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 70: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 51: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 57: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 11, time: 60.000000),
