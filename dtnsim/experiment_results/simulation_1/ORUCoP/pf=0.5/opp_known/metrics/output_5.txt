The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
178(10 to 6), 180(1 to 11), 187(1 to 6), 188(5 to 10), 208(4 to 1), 216(9 to 12), 226(3 to 9), 250(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(187: 15.000000), (216: 0.000000), (226: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(180: 5), (187: 4), (188: 2), (208: 4), (216: 4), (226: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
