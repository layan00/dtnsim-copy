The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
473(10 to 6), 476(1 to 11), 481(1 to 6), 482(5 to 10), 502(4 to 1), 510(9 to 12), 516(3 to 9), 544(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(476: 65.000000), (481: 15.000000), (482: 35.000000), (502: 60.000000), (510: 55.000000), (516: 15.000000), (544: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(476: 4), (481: 3), (482: 4), (502: 7), (510: 6), (516: 6), (544: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
