The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(10 to 6), 194(1 to 11), 203(1 to 6), 204(5 to 10), 228(4 to 1), 237(9 to 12), 248(3 to 9), 273(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 15.000000), (204: 35.000000), (228: 140.000000), (237: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 2), (203: 4), (204: 8), (228: 6), (237: 6), (248: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
