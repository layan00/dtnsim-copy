The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1346(10 to 6), 1350(1 to 11), 1357(1 to 6), 1358(5 to 10), 1379(4 to 1), 1387(9 to 12), 1400(3 to 9), 1423(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1350: 35.000000), (1387: 0.000000), (1400: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1350: 3), (1357: 1), (1358: 9), (1379: 3), (1387: 4), (1400: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
