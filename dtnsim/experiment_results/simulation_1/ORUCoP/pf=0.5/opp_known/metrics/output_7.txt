The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
757(10 to 6), 760(1 to 11), 765(1 to 6), 766(5 to 10), 785(4 to 1), 794(9 to 12), 804(3 to 9), 829(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(760: 55.000000), (765: 15.000000), (785: 140.000000), (794: 0.000000), (804: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(760: 7), (765: 4), (766: 2), (785: 6), (794: 4), (804: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
