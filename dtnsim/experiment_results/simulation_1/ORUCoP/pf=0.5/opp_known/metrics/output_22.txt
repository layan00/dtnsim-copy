The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
772(10 to 6), 776(1 to 11), 781(1 to 6), 782(5 to 10), 802(4 to 1), 814(9 to 12), 821(3 to 9), 845(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(781: 15.000000), (814: 0.000000), (821: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(776: 2), (781: 3), (782: 5), (802: 5), (814: 4), (821: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
