The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
184(10 to 6), 189(1 to 11), 194(1 to 6), 195(5 to 10), 213(4 to 1), 222(9 to 12), 229(3 to 9), 251(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(189: 65.000000), (194: 15.000000), (222: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 4), (194: 3), (195: 2), (213: 4), (222: 4), (229: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
