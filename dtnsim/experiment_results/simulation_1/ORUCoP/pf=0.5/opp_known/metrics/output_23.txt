The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1061(10 to 6), 1067(1 to 11), 1075(1 to 6), 1076(5 to 10), 1098(4 to 1), 1106(9 to 12), 1113(3 to 9), 1138(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1076: 35.000000), (1106: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1067: 1), (1075: 1), (1076: 8), (1098: 4), (1106: 4), (1113: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
