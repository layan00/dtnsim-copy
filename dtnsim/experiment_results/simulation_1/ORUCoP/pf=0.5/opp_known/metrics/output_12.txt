The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
773(10 to 6), 776(1 to 11), 782(1 to 6), 783(5 to 10), 806(4 to 1), 817(9 to 12), 828(3 to 9), 856(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(782: 15.000000), (783: 35.000000), (817: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(776: 5), (782: 4), (783: 10), (806: 4), (817: 4), (828: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
