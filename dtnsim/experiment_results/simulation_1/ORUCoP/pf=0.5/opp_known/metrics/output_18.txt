The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1047(10 to 6), 1051(1 to 11), 1057(1 to 6), 1058(5 to 10), 1078(4 to 1), 1086(9 to 12), 1098(3 to 9), 1126(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1058: 35.000000), (1078: 60.000000), (1086: 0.000000), (1098: 15.000000), (1126: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1051: 2), (1057: 1), (1058: 8), (1078: 8), (1086: 4), (1098: 7), (1126: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
