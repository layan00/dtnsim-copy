The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
767(10 to 6), 772(1 to 11), 776(1 to 6), 777(5 to 10), 794(4 to 1), 799(9 to 12), 806(3 to 9), 826(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(772: 65.000000), (794: 140.000000), (799: 0.000000), (806: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(772: 4), (777: 2), (794: 6), (799: 4), (806: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
