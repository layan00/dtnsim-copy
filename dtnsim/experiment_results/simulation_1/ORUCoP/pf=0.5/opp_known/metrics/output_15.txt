The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
179(10 to 6), 183(1 to 11), 188(1 to 6), 189(5 to 10), 207(4 to 1), 211(9 to 12), 223(3 to 9), 247(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 60.000000), (211: 55.000000), (223: 55.000000), (247: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 6), (207: 7), (211: 6), (223: 7), (247: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
