The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
483(10 to 6), 485(1 to 11), 491(1 to 6), 492(5 to 10), 512(4 to 1), 517(9 to 12), 528(3 to 9), 559(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(491: 25.000000), (517: 0.000000), (528: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(485: 5), (491: 2), (492: 2), (512: 4), (517: 4), (528: 10), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
