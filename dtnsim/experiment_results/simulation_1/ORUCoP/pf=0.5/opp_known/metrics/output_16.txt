The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
467(10 to 6), 470(1 to 11), 475(1 to 6), 476(5 to 10), 495(4 to 1), 499(9 to 12), 510(3 to 9), 535(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(495: 60.000000), (499: 55.000000), (510: 15.000000), (535: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(470: 2), (475: 1), (476: 4), (495: 6), (499: 6), (510: 7), (535: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
