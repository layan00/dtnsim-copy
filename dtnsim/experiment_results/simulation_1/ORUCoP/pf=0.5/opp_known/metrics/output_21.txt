The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
495(10 to 6), 498(1 to 11), 503(1 to 6), 504(5 to 10), 522(4 to 1), 527(9 to 12), 536(3 to 9), 561(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 0.000000), (536: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(504: 2), (522: 4), (527: 4), (536: 7), (561: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3:
