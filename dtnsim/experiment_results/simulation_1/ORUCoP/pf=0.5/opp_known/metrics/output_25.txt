The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
174(10 to 6), 177(1 to 11), 183(1 to 6), 184(5 to 10), 205(4 to 1), 209(9 to 12), 217(3 to 9), 238(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(217: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(177: 2), (183: 1), (184: 3), (205: 3), (209: 4), (217: 6), (238: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
