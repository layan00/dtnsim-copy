The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
456(10 to 6), 460(1 to 11), 466(1 to 6), 467(5 to 10), 489(4 to 1), 498(9 to 12), 506(3 to 9), 527(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(460: 65.000000), (466: 15.000000), (467: 55.000000), (489: 140.000000), (498: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(460: 8), (466: 4), (467: 5), (489: 6), (498: 4), (506: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
