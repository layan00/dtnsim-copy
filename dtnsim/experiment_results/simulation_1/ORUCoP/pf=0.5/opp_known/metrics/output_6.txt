The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
472(10 to 6), 476(1 to 11), 480(1 to 6), 481(5 to 10), 500(4 to 1), 508(9 to 12), 517(3 to 9), 549(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(481: 55.000000), (508: 0.000000), (517: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 9), (500: 4), (508: 4), (517: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
