The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1044(10 to 6), 1048(1 to 11), 1055(1 to 6), 1056(5 to 10), 1076(4 to 1), 1083(9 to 12), 1097(3 to 9), 1121(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1055: 15.000000), (1097: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1048: 5), (1055: 4), (1056: 4), (1076: 5), (1083: 4), (1097: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
