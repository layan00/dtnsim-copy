The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
750(10 to 6), 754(1 to 11), 759(1 to 6), 760(5 to 10), 783(4 to 1), 794(9 to 12), 805(3 to 9), 838(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(754: 65.000000), (759: 15.000000), (760: 35.000000), (794: 0.000000), (805: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(754: 8), (759: 4), (760: 11), (783: 6), (794: 4), (805: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
