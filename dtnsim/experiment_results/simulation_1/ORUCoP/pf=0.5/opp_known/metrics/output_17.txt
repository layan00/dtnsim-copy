The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
755(10 to 6), 758(1 to 11), 764(1 to 6), 765(5 to 10), 783(4 to 1), 787(9 to 12), 805(3 to 9), 830(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(758: 35.000000), (764: 25.000000), (787: 55.000000), (805: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(758: 3), (764: 2), (765: 4), (783: 4), (787: 6), (805: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
