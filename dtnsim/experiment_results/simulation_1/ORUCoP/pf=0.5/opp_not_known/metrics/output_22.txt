The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1025(10 to 6), 1041(1 to 11), 1047(1 to 6), 1048(5 to 10), 1083(4 to 1), 1090(9 to 12), 1113(3 to 9), 1148(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1047: 45.000000), (1090: 0.000000), (1113: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1041: 2), (1047: 4), (1048: 6), (1083: 5), (1090: 6), (1113: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 211 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
