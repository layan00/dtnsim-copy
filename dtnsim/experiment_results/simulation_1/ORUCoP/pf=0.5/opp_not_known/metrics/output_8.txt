The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1443(10 to 6), 1460(1 to 11), 1466(1 to 6), 1467(5 to 10), 1501(4 to 1), 1507(9 to 12), 1530(3 to 9), 1564(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1466: 45.000000), (1467: 35.000000), (1507: 0.000000), (1530: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1460: 1), (1466: 4), (1467: 5), (1501: 5), (1507: 6), (1530: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 229 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
