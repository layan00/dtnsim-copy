The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1416(10 to 6), 1432(1 to 11), 1438(1 to 6), 1439(5 to 10), 1473(4 to 1), 1479(9 to 12), 1503(3 to 9), 1534(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1438: 25.000000), (1503: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1432: 1), (1438: 4), (1439: 4), (1473: 3), (1479: 4), (1503: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 60 calls to RUCoP, which took 265 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
