The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1850(10 to 6), 1869(1 to 11), 1874(1 to 6), 1875(5 to 10), 1908(4 to 1), 1912(9 to 12), 1933(3 to 9), 1973(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1912: 55.000000), (1933: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1850: 6), (1874: 1), (1875: 4), (1908: 5), (1912: 6), (1933: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 218 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
