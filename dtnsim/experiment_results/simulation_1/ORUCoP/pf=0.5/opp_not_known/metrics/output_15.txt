The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
191(10 to 6), 207(1 to 11), 212(1 to 6), 213(5 to 10), 246(4 to 1), 251(9 to 12), 271(3 to 9), 304(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 60.000000), (251: 55.000000), (304: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 6), (246: 6), (251: 6), (271: 8), (304: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 198 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
