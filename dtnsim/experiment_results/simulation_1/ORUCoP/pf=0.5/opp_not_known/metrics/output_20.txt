The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(10 to 6), 223(1 to 11), 233(1 to 6), 234(5 to 10), 269(4 to 1), 275(9 to 12), 300(3 to 9), 334(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(233: 25.000000), (234: 35.000000), (275: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 2), (233: 4), (234: 6), (269: 5), (275: 6), (300: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 231 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
