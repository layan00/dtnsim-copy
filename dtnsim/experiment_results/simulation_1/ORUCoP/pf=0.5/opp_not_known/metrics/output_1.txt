The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
609(10 to 6), 625(1 to 11), 630(1 to 6), 631(5 to 10), 665(4 to 1), 670(9 to 12), 698(3 to 9), 733(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(630: 25.000000), (670: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(609: 6), (630: 2), (631: 8), (665: 4), (670: 6), (698: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 214 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
