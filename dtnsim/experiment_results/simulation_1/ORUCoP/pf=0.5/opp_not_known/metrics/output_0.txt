The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(10 to 6), 218(1 to 11), 227(1 to 6), 228(5 to 10), 263(4 to 1), 269(9 to 12), 294(3 to 9), 328(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 25.000000), (228: 35.000000), (269: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 2), (227: 4), (228: 6), (263: 5), (269: 6), (294: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 216 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
