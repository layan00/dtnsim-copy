The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1835(10 to 6), 1851(1 to 11), 1858(1 to 6), 1859(5 to 10), 1892(4 to 1), 1899(9 to 12), 1929(3 to 9), 1971(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1851: 35.000000), (1858: 45.000000), (1859: 35.000000), (1899: 0.000000), (1929: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1851: 6), (1858: 6), (1859: 6), (1892: 4), (1899: 6), (1929: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 221 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
