The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
599(10 to 6), 614(1 to 11), 618(1 to 6), 619(5 to 10), 652(4 to 1), 656(9 to 12), 676(3 to 9), 713(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(652: 60.000000), (656: 55.000000), (676: 15.000000), (713: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(618: 1), (619: 4), (652: 6), (656: 6), (676: 7), (713: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 201 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
