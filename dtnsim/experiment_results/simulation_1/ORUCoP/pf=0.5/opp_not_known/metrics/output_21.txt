The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
619(10 to 6), 634(1 to 11), 639(1 to 6), 640(5 to 10), 673(4 to 1), 678(9 to 12), 705(3 to 9), 739(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(640: 35.000000), (678: 0.000000), (705: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(640: 9), (673: 5), (678: 6), (705: 8), (739: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 195 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
