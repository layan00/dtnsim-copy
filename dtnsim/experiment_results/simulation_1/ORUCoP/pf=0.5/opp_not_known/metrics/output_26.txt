The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
593(10 to 6), 611(1 to 11), 618(1 to 6), 619(5 to 10), 653(4 to 1), 659(9 to 12), 684(3 to 9), 718(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(618: 25.000000), (619: 55.000000), (659: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(593: 4), (611: 2), (618: 3), (619: 6), (653: 4), (659: 6), (684: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 281 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
