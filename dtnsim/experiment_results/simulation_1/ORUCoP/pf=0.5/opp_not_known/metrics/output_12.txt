The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1042(10 to 6), 1059(1 to 11), 1064(1 to 6), 1065(5 to 10), 1098(4 to 1), 1104(9 to 12), 1130(3 to 9), 1168(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1064: 25.000000), (1104: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1042: 2), (1059: 4), (1064: 4), (1065: 6), (1098: 5), (1104: 6), (1130: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 257 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
