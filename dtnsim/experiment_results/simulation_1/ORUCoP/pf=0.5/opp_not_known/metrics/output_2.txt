The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1016(10 to 6), 1033(1 to 11), 1038(1 to 6), 1039(5 to 10), 1071(4 to 1), 1075(9 to 12), 1097(3 to 9), 1129(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1071: 140.000000), (1075: 0.000000), (1097: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1033: 2), (1039: 4), (1071: 8), (1075: 6), (1097: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 205 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
