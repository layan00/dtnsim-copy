The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1830(10 to 6), 1846(1 to 11), 1854(1 to 6), 1855(5 to 10), 1887(4 to 1), 1891(9 to 12), 1921(3 to 9), 1953(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1846: 35.000000), (1891: 0.000000), (1921: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1846: 6), (1854: 1), (1855: 4), (1887: 4), (1891: 6), (1921: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 215 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
