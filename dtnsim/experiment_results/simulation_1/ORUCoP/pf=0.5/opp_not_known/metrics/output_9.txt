The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1845(10 to 6), 1862(1 to 11), 1866(1 to 6), 1867(5 to 10), 1901(4 to 1), 1905(9 to 12), 1928(3 to 9), 1959(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1905: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1845: 2), (1866: 1), (1867: 4), (1901: 6), (1905: 6), (1928: 3), (1959: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 235 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
