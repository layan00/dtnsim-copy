The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1004(10 to 6), 1019(1 to 11), 1026(1 to 6), 1027(5 to 10), 1060(4 to 1), 1064(9 to 12), 1092(3 to 9), 1128(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1019: 35.000000), (1026: 25.000000), (1064: 55.000000), (1092: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1019: 5), (1026: 2), (1027: 4), (1060: 5), (1064: 6), (1092: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 201 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
