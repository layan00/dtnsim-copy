The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1438(10 to 6), 1456(1 to 11), 1465(1 to 6), 1466(5 to 10), 1499(4 to 1), 1503(9 to 12), 1525(3 to 9), 1559(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1503: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1456: 2), (1465: 1), (1466: 6), (1499: 4), (1503: 6), (1525: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 251 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
