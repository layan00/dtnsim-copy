The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(10 to 6), 215(1 to 11), 222(1 to 6), 223(5 to 10), 256(4 to 1), 264(9 to 12), 287(3 to 9), 322(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(222: 45.000000), (264: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 6), (215: 1), (222: 4), (223: 4), (256: 6), (264: 6), (287: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 211 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
