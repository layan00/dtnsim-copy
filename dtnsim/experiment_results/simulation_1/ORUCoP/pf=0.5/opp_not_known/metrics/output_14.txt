The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1893(10 to 6), 1909(1 to 11), 1914(1 to 6), 1915(5 to 10), 1948(4 to 1), 1953(9 to 12), 1976(3 to 9), 2012(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1914: 25.000000), (1915: 55.000000), (1948: 140.000000), (1976: 55.000000), (2012: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1914: 2), (1915: 7), (1948: 8), (1953: 4), (1976: 6), (2012: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 208 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
