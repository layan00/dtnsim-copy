The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
186(10 to 6), 203(1 to 11), 208(1 to 6), 209(5 to 10), 241(4 to 1), 246(9 to 12), 271(3 to 9), 302(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(271: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 2), (208: 1), (209: 7), (241: 5), (246: 4), (271: 6), (302: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 62 calls to RUCoP, which took 295 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
