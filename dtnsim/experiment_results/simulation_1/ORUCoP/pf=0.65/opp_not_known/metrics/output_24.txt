The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1800(10 to 6), 1819(1 to 11), 1823(1 to 6), 1824(5 to 10), 1857(4 to 1), 1861(9 to 12), 1881(3 to 9), 1915(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1861: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1800: 2), (1823: 1), (1824: 4), (1857: 4), (1861: 6), (1881: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 249 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
