The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1752(10 to 6), 1767(1 to 11), 1770(1 to 6), 1771(5 to 10), 1804(4 to 1), 1808(9 to 12), 1830(3 to 9), 1863(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1808: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1771: 4), (1804: 4), (1808: 6), (1830: 4), (1863: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 207 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
