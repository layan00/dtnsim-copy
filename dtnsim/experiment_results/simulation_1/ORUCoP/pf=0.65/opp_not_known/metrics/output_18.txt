The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1326(10 to 6), 1342(1 to 11), 1346(1 to 6), 1347(5 to 10), 1380(4 to 1), 1384(9 to 12), 1409(3 to 9), 1440(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1384: 0.000000), (1409: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1347: 4), (1380: 5), (1384: 6), (1409: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 206 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
