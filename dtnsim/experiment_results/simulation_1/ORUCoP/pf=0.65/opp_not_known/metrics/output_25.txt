The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(10 to 6), 189(1 to 11), 192(1 to 6), 193(5 to 10), 225(4 to 1), 231(9 to 12), 253(3 to 9), 284(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 4), (193: 6), (225: 3), (231: 4), (253: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 259 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
