The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
557(10 to 6), 574(1 to 11), 578(1 to 6), 579(5 to 10), 612(4 to 1), 619(9 to 12), 642(3 to 9), 675(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(578: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(557: 4), (574: 1), (578: 3), (579: 5), (612: 4), (619: 4), (642: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 66 calls to RUCoP, which took 302 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
