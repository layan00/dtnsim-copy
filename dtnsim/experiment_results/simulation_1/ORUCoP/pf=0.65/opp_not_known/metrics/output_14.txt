The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1794(10 to 6), 1809(1 to 11), 1813(1 to 6), 1814(5 to 10), 1847(4 to 1), 1853(9 to 12), 1874(3 to 9), 1909(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1813: 25.000000), (1874: 55.000000), (1909: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1813: 2), (1814: 6), (1847: 6), (1853: 4), (1874: 9), (1909: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 189 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
