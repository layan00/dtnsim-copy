The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
569(10 to 6), 583(1 to 11), 586(1 to 6), 587(5 to 10), 619(4 to 1), 623(9 to 12), 643(3 to 9), 680(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(643: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(587: 4), (619: 3), (623: 4), (643: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 224 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
