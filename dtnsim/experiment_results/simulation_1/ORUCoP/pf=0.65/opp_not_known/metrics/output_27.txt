The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
953(10 to 6), 969(1 to 11), 973(1 to 6), 974(5 to 10), 1009(4 to 1), 1015(9 to 12), 1042(3 to 9), 1080(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(969: 35.000000), (973: 25.000000), (974: 35.000000), (1015: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(969: 3), (973: 4), (974: 7), (1009: 5), (1015: 6), (1042: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 179 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
