The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
195(10 to 6), 212(1 to 11), 220(1 to 6), 221(5 to 10), 257(4 to 1), 262(9 to 12), 287(3 to 9), 321(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 25.000000), (262: 0.000000), (287: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 2), (220: 4), (221: 5), (257: 5), (262: 6), (287: 10), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 209 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
