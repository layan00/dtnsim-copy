The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1706(10 to 6), 1722(1 to 11), 1729(1 to 6), 1730(5 to 10), 1760(4 to 1), 1764(9 to 12), 1787(3 to 9), 1825(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1722: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1722: 7), (1729: 1), (1730: 6), (1760: 5), (1764: 4), (1787: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 248 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
