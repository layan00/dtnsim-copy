The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
946(10 to 6), 961(1 to 11), 966(1 to 6), 967(5 to 10), 999(4 to 1), 1003(9 to 12), 1025(3 to 9), 1057(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(961: 2), (967: 4), (999: 4), (1003: 4), (1025: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 261 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
