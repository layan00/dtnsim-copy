The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
183(10 to 6), 198(1 to 11), 206(1 to 6), 207(5 to 10), 239(4 to 1), 243(9 to 12), 266(3 to 9), 301(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 25.000000), (207: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 2), (206: 2), (207: 7), (239: 5), (243: 4), (266: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 212 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
