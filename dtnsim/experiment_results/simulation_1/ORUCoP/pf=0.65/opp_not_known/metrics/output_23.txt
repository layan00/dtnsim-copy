The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1400(10 to 6), 1417(1 to 11), 1423(1 to 6), 1424(5 to 10), 1459(4 to 1), 1465(9 to 12), 1489(3 to 9), 1527(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1465: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1417: 2), (1423: 1), (1424: 12), (1459: 4), (1465: 6), (1489: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 231 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
