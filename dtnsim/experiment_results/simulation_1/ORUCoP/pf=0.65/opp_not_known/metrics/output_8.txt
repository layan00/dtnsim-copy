The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1366(10 to 6), 1382(1 to 11), 1386(1 to 6), 1387(5 to 10), 1420(4 to 1), 1424(9 to 12), 1444(3 to 9), 1477(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1424: 55.000000), (1444: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1386: 1), (1387: 4), (1420: 4), (1424: 6), (1444: 10), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 189 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
