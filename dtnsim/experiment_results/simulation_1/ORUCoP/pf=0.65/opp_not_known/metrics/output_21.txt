The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
601(10 to 6), 616(1 to 11), 621(1 to 6), 622(5 to 10), 655(4 to 1), 661(9 to 12), 689(3 to 9), 721(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(622: 55.000000), (661: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(622: 12), (655: 5), (661: 6), (689: 4), (721: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
