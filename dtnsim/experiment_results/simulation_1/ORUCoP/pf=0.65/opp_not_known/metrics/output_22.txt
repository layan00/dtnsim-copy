The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1000(10 to 6), 1015(1 to 11), 1019(1 to 6), 1020(5 to 10), 1054(4 to 1), 1063(9 to 12), 1083(3 to 9), 1122(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1019: 45.000000), (1083: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1015: 1), (1019: 5), (1020: 6), (1054: 5), (1063: 4), (1083: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 220 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
