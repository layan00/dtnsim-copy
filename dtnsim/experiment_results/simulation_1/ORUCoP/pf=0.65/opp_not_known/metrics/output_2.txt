The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
965(10 to 6), 980(1 to 11), 984(1 to 6), 985(5 to 10), 1016(4 to 1), 1020(9 to 12), 1040(3 to 9), 1073(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1016: 140.000000), (1020: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(980: 2), (985: 4), (1016: 7), (1020: 6), (1040: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 227 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
