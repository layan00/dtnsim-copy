The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1354(10 to 6), 1369(1 to 11), 1374(1 to 6), 1375(5 to 10), 1407(4 to 1), 1411(9 to 12), 1434(3 to 9), 1468(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1411: 0.000000), (1434: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1375: 6), (1407: 6), (1411: 6), (1434: 6), (1468: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 211 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
