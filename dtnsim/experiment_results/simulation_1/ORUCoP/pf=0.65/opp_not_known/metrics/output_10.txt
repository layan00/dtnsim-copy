The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(10 to 6), 201(1 to 11), 206(1 to 6), 207(5 to 10), 240(4 to 1), 247(9 to 12), 268(3 to 9), 305(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 45.000000), (247: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 1), (206: 5), (207: 4), (240: 6), (247: 6), (268: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 192 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
