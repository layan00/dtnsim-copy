The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
177(10 to 6), 191(1 to 11), 196(1 to 6), 197(5 to 10), 231(4 to 1), 237(9 to 12), 262(3 to 9), 297(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(191: 55.000000), (196: 25.000000), (237: 0.000000), (262: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 4), (196: 4), (197: 4), (231: 4), (237: 6), (262: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 214 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
