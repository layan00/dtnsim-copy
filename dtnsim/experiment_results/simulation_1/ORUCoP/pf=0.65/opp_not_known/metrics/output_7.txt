The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
976(10 to 6), 991(1 to 11), 997(1 to 6), 998(5 to 10), 1032(4 to 1), 1037(9 to 12), 1060(3 to 9), 1091(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(997: 25.000000), (1032: 140.000000), (1037: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(991: 2), (997: 3), (998: 4), (1032: 7), (1037: 6), (1060: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 235 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
