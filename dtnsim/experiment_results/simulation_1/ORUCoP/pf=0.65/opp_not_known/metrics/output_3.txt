The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1341(10 to 6), 1356(1 to 11), 1361(1 to 6), 1362(5 to 10), 1394(4 to 1), 1398(9 to 12), 1419(3 to 9), 1451(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1361: 25.000000), (1419: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1361: 2), (1362: 4), (1394: 4), (1398: 4), (1419: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 224 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
