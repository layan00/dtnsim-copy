The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1724(10 to 6), 1741(1 to 11), 1746(1 to 6), 1747(5 to 10), 1781(4 to 1), 1789(9 to 12), 1815(3 to 9), 1853(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1741: 55.000000), (1746: 25.000000), (1815: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1741: 7), (1746: 5), (1747: 6), (1781: 3), (1789: 4), (1815: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 268 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
