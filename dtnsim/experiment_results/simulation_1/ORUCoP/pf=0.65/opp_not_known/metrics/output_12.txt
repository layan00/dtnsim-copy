The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
999(10 to 6), 1016(1 to 11), 1021(1 to 6), 1022(5 to 10), 1053(4 to 1), 1057(9 to 12), 1079(3 to 9), 1117(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1021: 25.000000), (1022: 55.000000), (1057: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(999: 2), (1021: 2), (1022: 8), (1053: 6), (1057: 6), (1079: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 222 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
