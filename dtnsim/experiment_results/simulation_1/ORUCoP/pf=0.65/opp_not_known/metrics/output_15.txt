The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
183(10 to 6), 199(1 to 11), 204(1 to 6), 205(5 to 10), 238(4 to 1), 244(9 to 12), 262(3 to 9), 296(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(262: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 6), (238: 3), (244: 4), (262: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
