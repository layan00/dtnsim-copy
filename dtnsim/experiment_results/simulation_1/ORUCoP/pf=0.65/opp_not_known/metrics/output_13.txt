The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1399(10 to 6), 1417(1 to 11), 1422(1 to 6), 1423(5 to 10), 1455(4 to 1), 1461(9 to 12), 1483(3 to 9), 1517(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1422: 25.000000), (1461: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1417: 2), (1422: 3), (1423: 4), (1455: 6), (1461: 5), (1483: 5), (1517: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 258 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
