The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
952(10 to 6), 956(1 to 11), 960(1 to 6), 961(5 to 10), 979(4 to 1), 987(9 to 12), 999(3 to 9), 1020(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(987: 0.000000), (999: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(961: 7), (979: 3), (987: 4), (999: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
