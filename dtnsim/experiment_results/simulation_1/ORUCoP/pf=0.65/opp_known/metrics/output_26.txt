The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
421(10 to 6), 424(1 to 11), 428(1 to 6), 429(5 to 10), 449(4 to 1), 458(9 to 12), 465(3 to 9), 491(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(424: 65.000000), (428: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(424: 11), (428: 3), (429: 3), (449: 3), (458: 4), (465: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
