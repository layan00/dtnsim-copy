The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
704(10 to 6), 707(1 to 11), 710(1 to 6), 711(5 to 10), 727(4 to 1), 731(9 to 12), 742(3 to 9), 762(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(707: 65.000000), (727: 140.000000), (731: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(707: 4), (711: 4), (727: 6), (731: 6), (742: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
