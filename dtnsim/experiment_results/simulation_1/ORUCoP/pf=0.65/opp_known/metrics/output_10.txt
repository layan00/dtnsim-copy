The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(10 to 6), 177(1 to 11), 182(1 to 6), 183(5 to 10), 201(4 to 1), 211(9 to 12), 217(3 to 9), 240(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(177: 65.000000), (182: 15.000000), (211: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(177: 8), (182: 3), (183: 2), (201: 4), (211: 4), (217: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
