The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
165(10 to 6), 167(1 to 11), 173(1 to 6), 174(5 to 10), 194(4 to 1), 202(9 to 12), 211(3 to 9), 234(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(173: 15.000000), (202: 0.000000), (211: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(167: 5), (173: 4), (174: 2), (194: 4), (202: 4), (211: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
