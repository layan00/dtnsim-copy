The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
436(10 to 6), 438(1 to 11), 441(1 to 6), 442(5 to 10), 459(4 to 1), 463(9 to 12), 474(3 to 9), 499(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(474: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(442: 4), (459: 3), (463: 4), (474: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
