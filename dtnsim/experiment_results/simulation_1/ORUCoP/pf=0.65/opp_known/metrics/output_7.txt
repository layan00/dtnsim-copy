The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
702(10 to 6), 705(1 to 11), 710(1 to 6), 711(5 to 10), 730(4 to 1), 739(9 to 12), 747(3 to 9), 771(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(710: 15.000000), (730: 140.000000), (739: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(705: 5), (710: 4), (711: 2), (730: 6), (739: 4), (747: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
