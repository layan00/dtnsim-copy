The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1238(10 to 6), 1241(1 to 11), 1244(1 to 6), 1245(5 to 10), 1263(4 to 1), 1271(9 to 12), 1278(3 to 9), 1301(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1271: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1245: 5), (1263: 5), (1271: 4), (1278: 4), (1301: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
