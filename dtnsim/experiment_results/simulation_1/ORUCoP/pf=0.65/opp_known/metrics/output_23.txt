The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1023(10 to 6), 1028(1 to 11), 1033(1 to 6), 1034(5 to 10), 1054(4 to 1), 1062(9 to 12), 1069(3 to 9), 1090(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1062: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1028: 1), (1033: 1), (1034: 5), (1054: 3), (1062: 4), (1069: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
