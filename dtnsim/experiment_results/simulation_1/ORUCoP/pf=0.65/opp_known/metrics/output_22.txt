The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
742(10 to 6), 745(1 to 11), 749(1 to 6), 750(5 to 10), 769(4 to 1), 778(9 to 12), 791(3 to 9), 819(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(749: 15.000000), (791: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(745: 2), (749: 3), (750: 6), (769: 5), (778: 4), (791: 10), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
