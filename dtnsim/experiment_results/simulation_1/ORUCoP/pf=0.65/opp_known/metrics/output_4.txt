The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1230(10 to 6), 1235(1 to 11), 1239(1 to 6), 1240(5 to 10), 1259(4 to 1), 1267(9 to 12), 1284(3 to 9), 1311(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1235: 55.000000), (1239: 15.000000), (1284: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1235: 8), (1239: 3), (1240: 6), (1259: 3), (1267: 4), (1284: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
