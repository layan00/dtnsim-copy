The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
961(10 to 6), 964(1 to 11), 970(1 to 6), 971(5 to 10), 989(4 to 1), 993(9 to 12), 1006(3 to 9), 1029(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(970: 25.000000), (1006: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(964: 5), (970: 2), (971: 4), (989: 4), (993: 4), (1006: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
