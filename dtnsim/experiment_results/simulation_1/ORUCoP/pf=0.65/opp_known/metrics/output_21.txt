The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
474(10 to 6), 477(1 to 11), 482(1 to 6), 483(5 to 10), 501(4 to 1), 506(9 to 12), 515(3 to 9), 536(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(506: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(483: 2), (501: 4), (506: 4), (515: 4), (536: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
