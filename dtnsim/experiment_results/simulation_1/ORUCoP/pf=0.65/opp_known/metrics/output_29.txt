The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1273(10 to 6), 1277(1 to 11), 1282(1 to 6), 1283(5 to 10), 1304(4 to 1), 1313(9 to 12), 1324(3 to 9), 1352(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1277: 35.000000), (1282: 15.000000), (1283: 35.000000), (1313: 0.000000), (1324: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1277: 4), (1282: 3), (1283: 5), (1304: 4), (1313: 4), (1324: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
