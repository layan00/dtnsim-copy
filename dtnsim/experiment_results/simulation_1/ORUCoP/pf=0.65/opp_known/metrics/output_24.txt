The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1291(10 to 6), 1296(1 to 11), 1301(1 to 6), 1302(5 to 10), 1321(4 to 1), 1325(9 to 12), 1336(3 to 9), 1357(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1325: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1296: 2), (1301: 1), (1302: 4), (1321: 3), (1325: 6), (1336: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
