The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
160(10 to 6), 163(1 to 11), 166(1 to 6), 167(5 to 10), 184(4 to 1), 188(9 to 12), 202(3 to 9), 220(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(167: 6), (184: 3), (188: 4), (202: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
