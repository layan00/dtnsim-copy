The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
171(10 to 6), 174(1 to 11), 182(1 to 6), 183(5 to 10), 203(4 to 1), 209(9 to 12), 219(3 to 9), 243(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(182: 25.000000), (183: 35.000000), (203: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(174: 2), (182: 2), (183: 8), (203: 6), (209: 4), (219: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 117 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
