The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
438(10 to 6), 442(1 to 11), 445(1 to 6), 446(5 to 10), 464(4 to 1), 469(9 to 12), 476(3 to 9), 499(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(469: 0.000000), (476: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(446: 2), (464: 4), (469: 4), (476: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
