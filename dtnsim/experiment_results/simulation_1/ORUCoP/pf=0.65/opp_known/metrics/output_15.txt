The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
171(10 to 6), 175(1 to 11), 180(1 to 6), 181(5 to 10), 199(4 to 1), 203(9 to 12), 214(3 to 9), 237(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(181: 6), (199: 4), (203: 4), (214: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
