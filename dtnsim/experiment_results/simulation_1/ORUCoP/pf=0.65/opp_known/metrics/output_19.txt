The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1213(10 to 6), 1217(1 to 11), 1223(1 to 6), 1224(5 to 10), 1243(4 to 1), 1247(9 to 12), 1256(3 to 9), 1280(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1217: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1217: 4), (1223: 1), (1224: 6), (1243: 3), (1247: 4), (1256: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
