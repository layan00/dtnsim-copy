The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
994(10 to 6), 997(1 to 11), 1002(1 to 6), 1003(5 to 10), 1022(4 to 1), 1027(9 to 12), 1035(3 to 9), 1063(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1027: 0.000000), (1035: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1003: 4), (1022: 5), (1027: 4), (1035: 10), (1063: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
