The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
703(10 to 6), 707(1 to 11), 712(1 to 6), 713(5 to 10), 736(4 to 1), 747(9 to 12), 758(3 to 9), 789(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(707: 65.000000), (712: 15.000000), (713: 35.000000), (747: 0.000000), (758: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(707: 8), (712: 4), (713: 11), (736: 5), (747: 4), (758: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
