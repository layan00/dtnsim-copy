The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
693(10 to 6), 696(1 to 11), 700(1 to 6), 701(5 to 10), 718(4 to 1), 722(9 to 12), 735(3 to 9), 755(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(696: 1), (701: 4), (718: 3), (722: 4), (735: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
