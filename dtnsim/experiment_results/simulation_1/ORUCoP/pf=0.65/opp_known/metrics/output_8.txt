The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
972(10 to 6), 976(1 to 11), 981(1 to 6), 982(5 to 10), 1001(4 to 1), 1005(9 to 12), 1016(3 to 9), 1038(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1005: 55.000000), (1016: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(976: 2), (981: 1), (982: 4), (1001: 4), (1005: 6), (1016: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
