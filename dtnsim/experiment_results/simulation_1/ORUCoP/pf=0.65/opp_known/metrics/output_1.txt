The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
444(10 to 6), 446(1 to 11), 452(1 to 6), 453(5 to 10), 473(4 to 1), 478(9 to 12), 488(3 to 9), 512(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(452: 25.000000), (478: 0.000000), (488: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(446: 5), (452: 2), (453: 2), (473: 3), (478: 4), (488: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
