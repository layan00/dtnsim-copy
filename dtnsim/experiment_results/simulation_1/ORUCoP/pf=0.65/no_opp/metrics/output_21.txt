The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
136(10 to 6), 139(1 to 11), 144(1 to 6), 145(5 to 10), 150(4 to 1), 152(9 to 12), 162(3 to 9), 165(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(150: 4), (152: 2), (162: 1), (165: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 162: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 150: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 152: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 152: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Bundle 150: (to: 10, time: 90.000000), (to: 10, time: 90.000000),
