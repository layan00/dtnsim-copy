The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
41(10 to 6), 45(1 to 11), 50(1 to 6), 51(5 to 10), 56(4 to 1), 61(9 to 12), 64(3 to 9), 68(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(45: 1), (50: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 45: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 50: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4:
