The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
302(10 to 6), 306(1 to 11), 312(1 to 6), 313(5 to 10), 318(4 to 1), 320(9 to 12), 326(3 to 9), 329(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(306: 2), (312: 1), (313: 1), (326: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 306: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), 
Bundle 312: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 306: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 326: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 313: (to: 4, time: 35.000000), 
Node 6:
