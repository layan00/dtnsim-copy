The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(10 to 6), 220(1 to 11), 224(1 to 6), 225(5 to 10), 231(4 to 1), 236(9 to 12), 242(3 to 9), 247(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 1), (224: 4), (231: 3), (236: 1), (242: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 220: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 224: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 224: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Bundle 242: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 231: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 242: (to: 5, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9:
