The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
299(10 to 6), 304(1 to 11), 309(1 to 6), 310(5 to 10), 317(4 to 1), 319(9 to 12), 325(3 to 9), 329(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(304: 1), (309: 1), (319: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 304: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), 
Bundle 309: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 319: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 319: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12:
