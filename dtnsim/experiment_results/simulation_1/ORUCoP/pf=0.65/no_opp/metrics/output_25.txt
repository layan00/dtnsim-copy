The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
28(10 to 6), 31(1 to 11), 34(1 to 6), 35(5 to 10), 39(4 to 1), 41(9 to 12), 48(3 to 9), 52(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(39: 2), (41: 1), (48: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 48: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 39: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 11, time: 65.000000),
