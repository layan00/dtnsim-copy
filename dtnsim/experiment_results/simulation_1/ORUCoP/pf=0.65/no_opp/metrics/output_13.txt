The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
285(10 to 6), 291(1 to 11), 295(1 to 6), 296(5 to 10), 300(4 to 1), 305(9 to 12), 311(3 to 9), 319(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(295: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(291: 2), (295: 3), (300: 4), (311: 1), (319: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 291: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 295: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 295: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 311: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 300: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 300: (to: 12, time: 110.000000), 
Node 6:
