The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
39(10 to 6), 42(1 to 11), 49(1 to 6), 50(5 to 10), 56(4 to 1), 58(9 to 12), 66(3 to 9), 72(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(49: 25.000000), (50: 35.000000), (56: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(42: 1), (49: 2), (50: 4), (56: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
