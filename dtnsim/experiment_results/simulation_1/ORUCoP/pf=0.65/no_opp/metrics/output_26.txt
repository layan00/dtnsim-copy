The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
94(10 to 6), 97(1 to 11), 101(1 to 6), 102(5 to 10), 108(4 to 1), 113(9 to 12), 121(3 to 9), 127(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(101: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(97: 1), (101: 3), (102: 2), (108: 2), (113: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 97: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 101: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 101: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 102: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 108: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 102: (to: 4, time: 35.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 113: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10:
