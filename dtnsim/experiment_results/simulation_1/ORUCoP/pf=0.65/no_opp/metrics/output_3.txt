The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
235(10 to 6), 238(1 to 11), 243(1 to 6), 244(5 to 10), 248(4 to 1), 250(9 to 12), 255(3 to 9), 259(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 243: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 243: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12:
