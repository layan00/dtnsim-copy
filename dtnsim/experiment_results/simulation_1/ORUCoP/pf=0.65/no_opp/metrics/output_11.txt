The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
122(10 to 6), 125(1 to 11), 130(1 to 6), 131(5 to 10), 137(4 to 1), 142(9 to 12), 145(3 to 9), 153(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(153: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(125: 1), (130: 2), (131: 1), (137: 2), (153: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 125: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 130: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 137: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 131: (to: 4, time: 35.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 153: (to: 1, time: 110.000000), (to: 1, time: 110.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 153: (to: 6, time: 110.000000), (to: 6, time: 110.000000),
