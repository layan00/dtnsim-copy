The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
367(10 to 6), 370(1 to 11), 374(1 to 6), 375(5 to 10), 380(4 to 1), 382(9 to 12), 388(3 to 9), 393(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(374: 25.000000), (393: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(374: 2), (382: 1), (393: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 374: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 374: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 393: (to: 1, time: 110.000000), (to: 1, time: 110.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 382: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 393: (to: 6, time: 110.000000), (to: 6, time: 110.000000),
