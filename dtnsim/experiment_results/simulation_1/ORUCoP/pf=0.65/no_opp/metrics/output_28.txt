The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
266(10 to 6), 269(1 to 11), 274(1 to 6), 275(5 to 10), 280(4 to 1), 282(9 to 12), 287(3 to 9), 293(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(275: 1), (280: 4), (293: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
