The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
313(10 to 6), 316(1 to 11), 319(1 to 6), 320(5 to 10), 325(4 to 1), 327(9 to 12), 332(3 to 9), 337(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(325: 3), (337: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 325: (to: 11, time: 60.000000),
