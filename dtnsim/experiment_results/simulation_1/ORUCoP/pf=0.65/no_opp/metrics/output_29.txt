The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
347(10 to 6), 351(1 to 11), 356(1 to 6), 357(5 to 10), 364(4 to 1), 369(9 to 12), 384(3 to 9), 395(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(351: 35.000000), (357: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(351: 6), (356: 4), (357: 3), (364: 4), (369: 1), (384: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
