The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
207(10 to 6), 210(1 to 11), 215(1 to 6), 216(5 to 10), 222(4 to 1), 224(9 to 12), 230(3 to 9), 236(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 2), (216: 1), (230: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 215: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 215: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 230: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 216: (to: 4, time: 35.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12:
