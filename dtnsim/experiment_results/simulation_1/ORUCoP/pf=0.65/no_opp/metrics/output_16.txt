The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
108(10 to 6), 110(1 to 11), 113(1 to 6), 114(5 to 10), 118(4 to 1), 120(9 to 12), 124(3 to 9), 133(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(118: 2), (124: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 124: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 118: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 124: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 124: (to: 5, time: 100.000000),
