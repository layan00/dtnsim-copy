The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
374(10 to 6), 379(1 to 11), 383(1 to 6), 384(5 to 10), 389(4 to 1), 391(9 to 12), 395(3 to 9), 401(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(383: 1), (395: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 383: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 395: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Node 14:
