The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
117(10 to 6), 119(1 to 11), 124(1 to 6), 125(5 to 10), 131(4 to 1), 133(9 to 12), 141(3 to 9), 148(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(124: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(124: 2), (131: 2), (133: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 124: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 124: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 131: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 133: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 133: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 133: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12:
