The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
301(10 to 6), 306(1 to 11), 310(1 to 6), 311(5 to 10), 317(4 to 1), 322(9 to 12), 333(3 to 9), 342(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(310: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(306: 4), (310: 5), (317: 2), (322: 1), (333: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 306: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
