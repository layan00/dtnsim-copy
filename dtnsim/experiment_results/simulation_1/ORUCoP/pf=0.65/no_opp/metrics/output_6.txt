The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
107(10 to 6), 111(1 to 11), 114(1 to 6), 115(5 to 10), 120(4 to 1), 122(9 to 12), 128(3 to 9), 132(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(122: 2), (128: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3:

Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 128: (to: 5, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 122: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 122: (to: 8, time: 55.000000),
