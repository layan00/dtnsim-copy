The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
336(10 to 6), 342(1 to 11), 347(1 to 6), 348(5 to 10), 353(4 to 1), 358(9 to 12), 367(3 to 9), 373(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(347: 25.000000), (353: 140.000000), (373: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(342: 2), (347: 3), (353: 4), (373: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
