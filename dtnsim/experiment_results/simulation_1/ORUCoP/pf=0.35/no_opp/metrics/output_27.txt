The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
292(10 to 6), 298(1 to 11), 304(1 to 6), 305(5 to 10), 314(4 to 1), 318(9 to 12), 335(3 to 9), 348(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(298: 35.000000), (304: 25.000000), (305: 35.000000), (335: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(298: 6), (304: 4), (305: 3), (314: 6), (318: 1), (335: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
