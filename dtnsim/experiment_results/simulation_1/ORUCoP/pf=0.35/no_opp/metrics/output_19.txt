The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
492(10 to 6), 496(1 to 11), 503(1 to 6), 504(5 to 10), 512(4 to 1), 514(9 to 12), 530(3 to 9), 538(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 35.000000), (503: 25.000000), (504: 35.000000), (512: 140.000000), (530: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(496: 3), (503: 2), (504: 3), (512: 8), (514: 2), (530: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
