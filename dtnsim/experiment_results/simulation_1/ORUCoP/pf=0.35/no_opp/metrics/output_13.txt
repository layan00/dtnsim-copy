The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
415(10 to 6), 422(1 to 11), 429(1 to 6), 430(5 to 10), 436(4 to 1), 441(9 to 12), 455(3 to 9), 467(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(429: 25.000000), (441: 55.000000), (455: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(422: 4), (429: 6), (430: 1), (436: 3), (441: 4), (455: 5), (467: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
