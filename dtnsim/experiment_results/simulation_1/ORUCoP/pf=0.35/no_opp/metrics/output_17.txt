The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
269(10 to 6), 272(1 to 11), 278(1 to 6), 279(5 to 10), 284(4 to 1), 286(9 to 12), 299(3 to 9), 308(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(272: 35.000000), (278: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(272: 3), (278: 2), (284: 4), (299: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
