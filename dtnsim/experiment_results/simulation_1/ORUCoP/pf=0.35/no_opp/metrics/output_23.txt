The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
408(10 to 6), 414(1 to 11), 423(1 to 6), 424(5 to 10), 432(4 to 1), 434(9 to 12), 440(3 to 9), 446(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(440: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(414: 1), (423: 1), (424: 1), (434: 2), (440: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 414: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), 
Bundle 423: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 440: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 424: (to: 4, time: 35.000000), 
Bundle 440: (to: 12, time: 110.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 440: (to: 5, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 434: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 434: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10:
