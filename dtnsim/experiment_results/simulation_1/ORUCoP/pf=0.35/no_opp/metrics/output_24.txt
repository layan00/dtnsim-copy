The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(10 to 6), 533(1 to 11), 538(1 to 6), 539(5 to 10), 545(4 to 1), 547(9 to 12), 554(3 to 9), 567(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(554: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(538: 1), (545: 6), (554: 6), (567: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
