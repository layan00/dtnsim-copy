The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(10 to 6), 220(1 to 11), 226(1 to 6), 227(5 to 10), 234(4 to 1), 236(9 to 12), 248(3 to 9), 259(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(226: 25.000000), (227: 35.000000), (236: 55.000000), (259: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(226: 2), (227: 3), (234: 6), (236: 4), (259: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
