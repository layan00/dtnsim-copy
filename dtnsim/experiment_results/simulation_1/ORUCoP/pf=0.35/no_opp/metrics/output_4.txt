The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
566(10 to 6), 572(1 to 11), 578(1 to 6), 579(5 to 10), 586(4 to 1), 590(9 to 12), 607(3 to 9), 615(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(572: 35.000000), (578: 25.000000), (590: 55.000000), (607: 65.000000), (615: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 6), (578: 3), (586: 2), (590: 4), (607: 6), (615: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
