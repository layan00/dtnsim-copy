The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
162(10 to 6), 166(1 to 11), 170(1 to 6), 171(5 to 10), 176(4 to 1), 178(9 to 12), 186(3 to 9), 194(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(186: 65.000000), (194: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(170: 1), (176: 2), (186: 6), (194: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 170: (to: 2, time: 35.000000),
