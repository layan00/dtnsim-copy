The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
174(10 to 6), 178(1 to 11), 185(1 to 6), 186(5 to 10), 194(4 to 1), 198(9 to 12), 208(3 to 9), 214(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(185: 25.000000), (186: 55.000000), (194: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(178: 2), (185: 3), (186: 3), (194: 5), (198: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 178: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
