The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
540(10 to 6), 545(1 to 11), 551(1 to 6), 552(5 to 10), 559(4 to 1), 561(9 to 12), 575(3 to 9), 586(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(545: 35.000000), (551: 25.000000), (552: 35.000000), (559: 140.000000), (586: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(545: 3), (551: 2), (552: 3), (559: 8), (561: 1), (575: 2), (586: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
