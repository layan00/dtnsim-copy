The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
163(10 to 6), 167(1 to 11), 173(1 to 6), 174(5 to 10), 180(4 to 1), 185(9 to 12), 191(3 to 9), 199(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(173: 25.000000), (180: 60.000000), (199: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(167: 1), (173: 3), (174: 1), (180: 4), (199: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 167: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 173: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 173: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4:
