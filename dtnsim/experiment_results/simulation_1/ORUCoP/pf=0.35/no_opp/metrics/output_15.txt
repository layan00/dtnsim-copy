The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
53(10 to 6), 57(1 to 11), 62(1 to 6), 63(5 to 10), 69(4 to 1), 74(9 to 12), 78(3 to 9), 85(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(62: 65.000000), (69: 60.000000), (78: 65.000000), (85: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(57: 1), (62: 4), (69: 4), (74: 1), (78: 4), (85: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
