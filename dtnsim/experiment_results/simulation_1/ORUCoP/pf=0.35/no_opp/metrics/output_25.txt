The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
60(10 to 6), 64(1 to 11), 70(1 to 6), 71(5 to 10), 78(4 to 1), 80(9 to 12), 94(3 to 9), 99(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(70: 25.000000), (71: 55.000000), (99: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 2), (71: 3), (78: 4), (80: 2), (94: 1), (99: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
