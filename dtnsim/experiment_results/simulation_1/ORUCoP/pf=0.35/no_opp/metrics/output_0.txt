The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
73(10 to 6), 80(1 to 11), 88(1 to 6), 89(5 to 10), 98(4 to 1), 102(9 to 12), 120(3 to 9), 132(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 35.000000), (88: 25.000000), (89: 35.000000), (98: 140.000000), (120: 65.000000), (132: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 6), (88: 4), (89: 3), (98: 8), (102: 2), (120: 5), (132: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 98 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
