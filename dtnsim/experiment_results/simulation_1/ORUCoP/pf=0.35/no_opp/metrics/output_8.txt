The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
439(10 to 6), 446(1 to 11), 455(1 to 6), 456(5 to 10), 464(4 to 1), 468(9 to 12), 481(3 to 9), 492(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(446: 35.000000), (455: 65.000000), (456: 35.000000), (481: 65.000000), (492: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(446: 6), (455: 3), (456: 3), (464: 4), (481: 6), (492: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
