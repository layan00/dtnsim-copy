The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
309(10 to 6), 313(1 to 11), 319(1 to 6), 320(5 to 10), 327(4 to 1), 331(9 to 12), 344(3 to 9), 354(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(313: 35.000000), (319: 25.000000), (327: 140.000000), (354: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(313: 6), (319: 3), (327: 8), (344: 2), (354: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
