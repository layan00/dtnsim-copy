The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(10 to 6), 194(1 to 11), 200(1 to 6), 201(5 to 10), 207(4 to 1), 209(9 to 12), 220(3 to 9), 233(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 140.000000), (209: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(207: 8), (209: 4), (220: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
