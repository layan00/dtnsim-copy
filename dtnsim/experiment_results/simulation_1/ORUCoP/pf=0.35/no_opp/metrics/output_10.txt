The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
58(10 to 6), 64(1 to 11), 70(1 to 6), 71(5 to 10), 76(4 to 1), 81(9 to 12), 88(3 to 9), 93(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(70: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(64: 2), (70: 3), (88: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 64: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 70: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 70: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 88: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5:
