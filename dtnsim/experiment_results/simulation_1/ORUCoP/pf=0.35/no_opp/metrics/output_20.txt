The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
68(10 to 6), 74(1 to 11), 83(1 to 6), 84(5 to 10), 93(4 to 1), 97(9 to 12), 112(3 to 9), 121(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(74: 35.000000), (83: 25.000000), (84: 35.000000), (112: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(74: 6), (83: 3), (84: 3), (93: 4), (97: 1), (112: 5), (121: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
