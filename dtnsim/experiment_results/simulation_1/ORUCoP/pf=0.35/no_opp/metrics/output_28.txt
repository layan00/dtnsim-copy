The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
423(10 to 6), 427(1 to 11), 435(1 to 6), 436(5 to 10), 443(4 to 1), 447(9 to 12), 454(3 to 9), 461(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(435: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(427: 1), (435: 3), (436: 1), (443: 3), (461: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 427: (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
