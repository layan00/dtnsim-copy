The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
278(10 to 6), 281(1 to 11), 286(1 to 6), 287(5 to 10), 296(4 to 1), 300(9 to 12), 315(3 to 9), 325(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(281: 35.000000), (286: 25.000000), (287: 35.000000), (296: 140.000000), (315: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(281: 3), (286: 3), (287: 3), (296: 8), (300: 2), (315: 5), (325: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
