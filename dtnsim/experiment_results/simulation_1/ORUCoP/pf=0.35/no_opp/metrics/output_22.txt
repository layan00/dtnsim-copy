The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
294(10 to 6), 299(1 to 11), 305(1 to 6), 306(5 to 10), 314(4 to 1), 318(9 to 12), 326(3 to 9), 333(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(305: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(299: 2), (305: 3), (314: 3), (318: 1), (326: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 299: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 305: (to: 2, time: 35.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 305: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 326: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 314: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 326: (to: 5, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 318: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 314: (to: 7, time: 160.000000),
