The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
535(10 to 6), 539(1 to 11), 546(1 to 6), 547(5 to 10), 554(4 to 1), 559(9 to 12), 576(3 to 9), 589(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(539: 35.000000), (546: 25.000000), (547: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(539: 6), (546: 5), (547: 3), (554: 6), (559: 1), (576: 2), (589: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
