The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(10 to 6), 212(1 to 11), 220(1 to 6), 221(5 to 10), 244(4 to 1), 254(9 to 12), 274(3 to 9), 301(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 35.000000), (220: 25.000000), (221: 35.000000), (244: 140.000000), (254: 0.000000), (274: 15.000000), (301: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 5), (220: 4), (221: 11), (244: 6), (254: 6), (274: 5), (301: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
