The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
525(10 to 6), 530(1 to 11), 536(1 to 6), 537(5 to 10), 556(4 to 1), 564(9 to 12), 576(3 to 9), 607(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(537: 35.000000), (556: 140.000000), (564: 0.000000), (576: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(537: 8), (556: 7), (564: 4), (576: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
