The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
834(10 to 6), 838(1 to 11), 844(1 to 6), 845(5 to 10), 865(4 to 1), 875(9 to 12), 890(3 to 9), 919(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(838: 35.000000), (844: 25.000000), (845: 35.000000), (865: 140.000000), (875: 0.000000), (890: 15.000000), (919: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(838: 5), (844: 3), (845: 8), (865: 6), (875: 4), (890: 7), (919: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
