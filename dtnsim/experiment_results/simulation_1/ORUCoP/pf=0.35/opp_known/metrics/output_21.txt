The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
515(10 to 6), 518(1 to 11), 524(1 to 6), 525(5 to 10), 543(4 to 1), 548(9 to 12), 558(3 to 9), 583(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(548: 0.000000), (558: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(525: 2), (543: 4), (548: 4), (558: 7), (583: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 558: (to: 14, time: 80.000000), (to: 14, time: 90.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000),
