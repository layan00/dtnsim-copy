The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(10 to 6), 206(1 to 11), 215(1 to 6), 216(5 to 10), 239(4 to 1), 249(9 to 12), 264(3 to 9), 289(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 35.000000), (215: 25.000000), (216: 35.000000), (249: 0.000000), (264: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 5), (215: 3), (216: 11), (239: 4), (249: 4), (264: 6), (289: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
