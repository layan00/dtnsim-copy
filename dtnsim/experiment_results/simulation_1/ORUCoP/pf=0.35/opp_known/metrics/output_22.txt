The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
807(10 to 6), 812(1 to 11), 818(1 to 6), 819(5 to 10), 840(4 to 1), 850(9 to 12), 859(3 to 9), 885(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(818: 25.000000), (850: 0.000000), (859: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(812: 2), (818: 3), (819: 5), (840: 5), (850: 4), (859: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
