The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
493(10 to 6), 497(1 to 11), 502(1 to 6), 503(5 to 10), 522(4 to 1), 526(9 to 12), 540(3 to 9), 565(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(522: 60.000000), (526: 55.000000), (540: 15.000000), (565: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(497: 2), (502: 1), (503: 4), (522: 6), (526: 6), (540: 7), (565: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
