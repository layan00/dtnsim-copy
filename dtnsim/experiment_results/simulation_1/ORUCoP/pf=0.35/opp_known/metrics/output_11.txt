The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
493(10 to 6), 497(1 to 11), 503(1 to 6), 504(5 to 10), 524(4 to 1), 530(9 to 12), 538(3 to 9), 572(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(497: 65.000000), (503: 25.000000), (504: 35.000000), (524: 60.000000), (530: 55.000000), (538: 15.000000), (572: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(497: 4), (503: 2), (504: 4), (524: 7), (530: 6), (538: 10), (572: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
