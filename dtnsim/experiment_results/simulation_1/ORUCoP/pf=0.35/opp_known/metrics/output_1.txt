The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
536(10 to 6), 541(1 to 11), 548(1 to 6), 549(5 to 10), 571(4 to 1), 576(9 to 12), 587(3 to 9), 622(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(541: 65.000000), (548: 25.000000), (549: 35.000000), (571: 60.000000), (576: 0.000000), (587: 15.000000), (622: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(541: 8), (548: 2), (549: 5), (571: 8), (576: 4), (587: 10), (622: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
