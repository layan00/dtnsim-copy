The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
622(10 to 6), 638(1 to 11), 642(1 to 6), 643(5 to 10), 676(4 to 1), 678(9 to 12), 702(3 to 9), 739(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(678: 55.000000), (702: 15.000000), (739: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(642: 1), (643: 4), (676: 2), (678: 5), (702: 7), (739: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
