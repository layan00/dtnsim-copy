The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1068(10 to 6), 1085(1 to 11), 1090(1 to 6), 1091(5 to 10), 1125(4 to 1), 1129(9 to 12), 1161(3 to 9), 1198(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1085: 35.000000), (1090: 25.000000), (1091: 35.000000), (1125: 140.000000), (1129: 0.000000), (1161: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1068: 2), (1085: 3), (1090: 4), (1091: 6), (1125: 8), (1129: 6), (1161: 6), (1198: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 216 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
