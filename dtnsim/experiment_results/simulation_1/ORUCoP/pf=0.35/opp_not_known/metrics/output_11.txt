The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
631(10 to 6), 649(1 to 11), 657(1 to 6), 658(5 to 10), 689(4 to 1), 694(9 to 12), 716(3 to 9), 757(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(657: 25.000000), (689: 60.000000), (694: 55.000000), (716: 65.000000), (757: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(631: 8), (649: 1), (657: 3), (658: 6), (689: 5), (694: 6), (716: 6), (757: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 222 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
