The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(10 to 6), 236(1 to 11), 246(1 to 6), 247(5 to 10), 282(4 to 1), 285(9 to 12), 318(3 to 9), 355(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 35.000000), (246: 25.000000), (247: 35.000000), (282: 140.000000), (285: 0.000000), (318: 65.000000), (355: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 7), (246: 4), (247: 6), (282: 8), (285: 6), (318: 5), (355: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 207 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
