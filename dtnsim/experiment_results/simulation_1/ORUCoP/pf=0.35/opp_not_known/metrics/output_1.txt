The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
667(10 to 6), 686(1 to 11), 692(1 to 6), 693(5 to 10), 725(4 to 1), 727(9 to 12), 755(3 to 9), 793(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(667: 105.000000), (692: 25.000000), (693: 35.000000), (725: 60.000000), (727: 0.000000), (793: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(667: 5), (692: 2), (693: 6), (725: 5), (727: 6), (755: 5), (793: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 205 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
