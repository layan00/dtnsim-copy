The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(10 to 6), 232(1 to 11), 245(1 to 6), 246(5 to 10), 282(4 to 1), 288(9 to 12), 318(3 to 9), 354(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 45.000000), (232: 35.000000), (245: 25.000000), (246: 35.000000), (288: 0.000000), (318: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 6), (232: 7), (245: 4), (246: 6), (282: 3), (288: 6), (318: 6), (354: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 266 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
