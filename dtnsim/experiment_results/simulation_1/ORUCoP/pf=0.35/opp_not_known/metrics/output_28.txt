The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1511(10 to 6), 1527(1 to 11), 1535(1 to 6), 1536(5 to 10), 1568(4 to 1), 1572(9 to 12), 1597(3 to 9), 1633(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1535: 25.000000), (1572: 0.000000), (1597: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1527: 1), (1535: 3), (1536: 6), (1568: 4), (1572: 6), (1597: 6), (1633: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 210 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
