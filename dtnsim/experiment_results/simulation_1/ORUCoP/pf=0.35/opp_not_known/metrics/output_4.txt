The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1969(10 to 6), 1989(1 to 11), 1997(1 to 6), 1998(5 to 10), 2034(4 to 1), 2038(9 to 12), 2070(3 to 9), 2108(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1969: 105.000000), (1989: 35.000000), (1997: 25.000000), (2038: 55.000000), (2070: 15.000000), (2108: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1969: 5), (1989: 7), (1997: 3), (1998: 8), (2034: 2), (2038: 5), (2070: 7), (2108: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 60 calls to RUCoP, which took 293 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
