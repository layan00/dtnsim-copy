The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1939(10 to 6), 1955(1 to 11), 1964(1 to 6), 1965(5 to 10), 1999(4 to 1), 2004(9 to 12), 2036(3 to 9), 2078(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1955: 35.000000), (1964: 25.000000), (1965: 35.000000), (2004: 0.000000), (2036: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1955: 7), (1964: 5), (1965: 6), (1999: 6), (2004: 6), (2036: 7), (2078: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 233 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
