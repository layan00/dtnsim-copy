The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1538(10 to 6), 1556(1 to 11), 1562(1 to 6), 1563(5 to 10), 1598(4 to 1), 1602(9 to 12), 1630(3 to 9), 1663(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1562: 25.000000), (1602: 0.000000), (1630: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1538: 2), (1556: 1), (1562: 4), (1563: 4), (1598: 4), (1602: 6), (1630: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 241 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
