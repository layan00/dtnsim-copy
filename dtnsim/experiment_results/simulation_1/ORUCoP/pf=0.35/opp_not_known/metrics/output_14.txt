The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1957(10 to 6), 1974(1 to 11), 1981(1 to 6), 1982(5 to 10), 2015(4 to 1), 2018(9 to 12), 2049(3 to 9), 2087(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1974: 35.000000), (1981: 25.000000), (1982: 35.000000), (2015: 140.000000), (2049: 15.000000), (2087: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1974: 6), (1981: 2), (1982: 6), (2015: 8), (2018: 5), (2049: 7), (2087: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 201 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
