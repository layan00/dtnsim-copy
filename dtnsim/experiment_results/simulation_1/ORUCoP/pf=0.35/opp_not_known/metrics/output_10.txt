The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(10 to 6), 222(1 to 11), 232(1 to 6), 233(5 to 10), 267(4 to 1), 272(9 to 12), 298(3 to 9), 333(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(232: 25.000000), (272: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 6), (222: 5), (232: 3), (233: 4), (267: 5), (272: 6), (298: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 254 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
