The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1902(10 to 6), 1918(1 to 11), 1926(1 to 6), 1927(5 to 10), 1960(4 to 1), 1962(9 to 12), 1997(3 to 9), 2032(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1918: 35.000000), (1926: 25.000000), (1927: 35.000000), (1960: 140.000000), (1962: 0.000000), (1997: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1918: 6), (1926: 2), (1927: 6), (1960: 8), (1962: 6), (1997: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 166 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
