The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1659(10 to 6), 1674(1 to 11), 1676(1 to 6), 1677(5 to 10), 1707(4 to 1), 1712(9 to 12), 1732(3 to 9), 1767(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1767: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1677: 6), (1707: 4), (1712: 3), (1732: 4), (1767: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 200 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
