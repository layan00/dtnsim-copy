The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
917(10 to 6), 934(1 to 11), 937(1 to 6), 938(5 to 10), 968(4 to 1), 972(9 to 12), 992(3 to 9), 1029(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(972: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(917: 2), (938: 6), (968: 5), (972: 6), (992: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 246 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
