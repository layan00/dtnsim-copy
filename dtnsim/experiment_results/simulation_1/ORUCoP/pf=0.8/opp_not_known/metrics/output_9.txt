The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1676(10 to 6), 1691(1 to 11), 1693(1 to 6), 1694(5 to 10), 1725(4 to 1), 1729(9 to 12), 1751(3 to 9), 1785(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1729: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1694: 4), (1725: 4), (1729: 6), (1751: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 187 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
