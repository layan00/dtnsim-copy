The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1306(10 to 6), 1322(1 to 11), 1326(1 to 6), 1327(5 to 10), 1357(4 to 1), 1361(9 to 12), 1383(3 to 9), 1415(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1383: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1326: 1), (1327: 4), (1357: 4), (1361: 4), (1383: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 212 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
