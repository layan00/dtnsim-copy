The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
555(10 to 6), 573(1 to 11), 576(1 to 6), 577(5 to 10), 607(4 to 1), 612(9 to 12), 636(3 to 9), 671(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(577: 55.000000), (636: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(555: 2), (577: 10), (607: 6), (612: 4), (636: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 242 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
