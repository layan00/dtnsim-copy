The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
162(10 to 6), 179(1 to 11), 181(1 to 6), 182(5 to 10), 211(4 to 1), 215(9 to 12), 236(3 to 9), 268(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(162: 4), (182: 4), (211: 4), (215: 4), (236: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 237 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
