The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1267(10 to 6), 1282(1 to 11), 1286(1 to 6), 1287(5 to 10), 1317(4 to 1), 1321(9 to 12), 1346(3 to 9), 1375(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1321: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1287: 4), (1317: 4), (1321: 6), (1346: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 193 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
