The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
175(10 to 6), 190(1 to 11), 195(1 to 6), 196(5 to 10), 226(4 to 1), 231(9 to 12), 251(3 to 9), 284(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(251: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 6), (226: 4), (231: 3), (251: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 196 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
