The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
901(10 to 6), 916(1 to 11), 921(1 to 6), 922(5 to 10), 952(4 to 1), 956(9 to 12), 978(3 to 9), 1011(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(916: 2), (922: 4), (952: 4), (956: 4), (978: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 238 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
