The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1651(10 to 6), 1668(1 to 11), 1673(1 to 6), 1674(5 to 10), 1705(4 to 1), 1710(9 to 12), 1735(3 to 9), 1770(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1668: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1668: 7), (1674: 6), (1705: 4), (1710: 3), (1735: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 236 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
