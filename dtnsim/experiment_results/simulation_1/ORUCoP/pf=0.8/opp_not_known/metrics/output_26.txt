The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
523(10 to 6), 539(1 to 11), 541(1 to 6), 542(5 to 10), 571(4 to 1), 575(9 to 12), 597(3 to 9), 632(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(523: 6), (542: 4), (571: 3), (575: 4), (597: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 60 calls to RUCoP, which took 265 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
