The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1671(10 to 6), 1687(1 to 11), 1692(1 to 6), 1693(5 to 10), 1723(4 to 1), 1728(9 to 12), 1749(3 to 9), 1782(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1749: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1687: 2), (1693: 6), (1723: 4), (1728: 3), (1749: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 224 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
