The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
919(10 to 6), 934(1 to 11), 938(1 to 6), 939(5 to 10), 968(4 to 1), 972(9 to 12), 993(3 to 9), 1026(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(968: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(934: 2), (939: 4), (968: 10), (972: 4), (993: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 218 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
