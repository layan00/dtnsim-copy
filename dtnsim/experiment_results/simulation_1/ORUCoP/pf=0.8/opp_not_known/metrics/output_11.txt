The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
539(10 to 6), 554(1 to 11), 558(1 to 6), 559(5 to 10), 589(4 to 1), 593(9 to 12), 611(3 to 9), 652(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(611: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(559: 6), (589: 4), (593: 4), (611: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 210 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
