The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1284(10 to 6), 1298(1 to 11), 1301(1 to 6), 1302(5 to 10), 1331(4 to 1), 1335(9 to 12), 1357(3 to 9), 1389(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1302: 4), (1331: 4), (1335: 4), (1357: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 211 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
