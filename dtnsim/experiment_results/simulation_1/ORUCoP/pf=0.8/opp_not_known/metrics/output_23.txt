The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1300(10 to 6), 1314(1 to 11), 1317(1 to 6), 1318(5 to 10), 1350(4 to 1), 1354(9 to 12), 1378(3 to 9), 1411(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1354: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1317: 1), (1318: 4), (1350: 4), (1354: 6), (1378: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 184 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
