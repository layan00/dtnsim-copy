The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
177(10 to 6), 192(1 to 11), 199(1 to 6), 200(5 to 10), 230(4 to 1), 234(9 to 12), 256(3 to 9), 290(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(200: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(192: 2), (200: 5), (230: 4), (234: 4), (256: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 255 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
