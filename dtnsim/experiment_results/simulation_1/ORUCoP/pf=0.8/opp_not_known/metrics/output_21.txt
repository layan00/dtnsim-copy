The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
556(10 to 6), 570(1 to 11), 574(1 to 6), 575(5 to 10), 605(4 to 1), 609(9 to 12), 634(3 to 9), 665(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(609: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(575: 4), (605: 4), (609: 6), (634: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 195 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
