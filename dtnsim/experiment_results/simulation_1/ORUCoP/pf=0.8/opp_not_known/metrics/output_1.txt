The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
549(10 to 6), 565(1 to 11), 569(1 to 6), 570(5 to 10), 600(4 to 1), 605(9 to 12), 627(3 to 9), 660(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(627: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(549: 4), (570: 6), (600: 4), (605: 3), (627: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 230 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
