The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
923(10 to 6), 938(1 to 11), 940(1 to 6), 941(5 to 10), 972(4 to 1), 979(9 to 12), 1000(3 to 9), 1037(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(940: 45.000000), (1000: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(938: 1), (940: 5), (941: 4), (972: 4), (979: 4), (1000: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 243 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
