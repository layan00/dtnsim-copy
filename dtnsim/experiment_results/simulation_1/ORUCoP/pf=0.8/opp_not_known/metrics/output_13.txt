The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1288(10 to 6), 1304(1 to 11), 1308(1 to 6), 1309(5 to 10), 1339(4 to 1), 1345(9 to 12), 1368(3 to 9), 1400(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1308: 25.000000), (1345: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1304: 2), (1308: 3), (1309: 4), (1339: 4), (1345: 6), (1368: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 224 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
