The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
899(10 to 6), 914(1 to 11), 917(1 to 6), 918(5 to 10), 950(4 to 1), 956(9 to 12), 982(3 to 9), 1019(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(914: 55.000000), (917: 25.000000), (956: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(914: 4), (917: 4), (918: 5), (950: 4), (956: 6), (982: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 225 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
