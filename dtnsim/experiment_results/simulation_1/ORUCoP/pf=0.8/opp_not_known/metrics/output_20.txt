The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
177(10 to 6), 194(1 to 11), 200(1 to 6), 201(5 to 10), 233(4 to 1), 239(9 to 12), 262(3 to 9), 296(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(200: 25.000000), (262: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 2), (200: 4), (201: 6), (233: 4), (239: 3), (262: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 233 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
