The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1626(10 to 6), 1641(1 to 11), 1645(1 to 6), 1646(5 to 10), 1675(4 to 1), 1679(9 to 12), 1698(3 to 9), 1734(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1646: 6), (1675: 5), (1679: 4), (1698: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 202 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
