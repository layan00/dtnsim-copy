The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
539(10 to 6), 553(1 to 11), 555(1 to 6), 556(5 to 10), 585(4 to 1), 589(9 to 12), 610(3 to 9), 645(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(610: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(556: 4), (585: 3), (589: 4), (610: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 224 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
