The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
171(10 to 6), 185(1 to 11), 190(1 to 6), 191(5 to 10), 222(4 to 1), 228(9 to 12), 251(3 to 9), 285(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(190: 25.000000), (228: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 1), (190: 4), (191: 4), (222: 4), (228: 6), (251: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 221 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
