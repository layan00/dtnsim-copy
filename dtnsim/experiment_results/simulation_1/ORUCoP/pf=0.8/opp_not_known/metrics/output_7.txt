The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
935(10 to 6), 950(1 to 11), 954(1 to 6), 955(5 to 10), 985(4 to 1), 989(9 to 12), 1013(3 to 9), 1044(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(989: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(950: 2), (955: 4), (985: 6), (989: 6), (1013: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 202 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
