The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1669(10 to 6), 1687(1 to 11), 1690(1 to 6), 1691(5 to 10), 1720(4 to 1), 1724(9 to 12), 1746(3 to 9), 1778(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1669: 2), (1691: 4), (1720: 4), (1724: 4), (1746: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 266 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
