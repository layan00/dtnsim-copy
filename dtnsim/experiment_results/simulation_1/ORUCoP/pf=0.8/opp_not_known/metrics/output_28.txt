The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1286(10 to 6), 1300(1 to 11), 1305(1 to 6), 1306(5 to 10), 1337(4 to 1), 1341(9 to 12), 1363(3 to 9), 1400(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1341: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1306: 5), (1337: 6), (1341: 6), (1363: 10), (1400: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 236 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
