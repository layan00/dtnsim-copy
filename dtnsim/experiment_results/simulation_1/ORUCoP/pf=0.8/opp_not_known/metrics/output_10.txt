The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
167(10 to 6), 182(1 to 11), 186(1 to 6), 187(5 to 10), 217(4 to 1), 221(9 to 12), 243(3 to 9), 275(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(187: 4), (217: 6), (221: 6), (243: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 168 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
