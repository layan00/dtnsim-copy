The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
141(10 to 6), 144(1 to 11), 146(1 to 6), 147(5 to 10), 152(4 to 1), 157(9 to 12), 161(3 to 9), 164(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(146: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(144: 1), (146: 4), (152: 1), (161: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 144: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 146: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 146: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Bundle 161: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 152: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 161: (to: 5, time: 100.000000), (to: 5, time: 100.000000),
