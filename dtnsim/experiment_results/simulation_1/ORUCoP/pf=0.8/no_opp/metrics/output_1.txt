The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
95(10 to 6), 97(1 to 11), 101(1 to 6), 102(5 to 10), 106(4 to 1), 108(9 to 12), 113(3 to 9), 116(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(108: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
