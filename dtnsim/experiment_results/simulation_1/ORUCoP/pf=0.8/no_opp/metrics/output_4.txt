The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
234(10 to 6), 239(1 to 11), 243(1 to 6), 244(5 to 10), 249(4 to 1), 251(9 to 12), 258(3 to 9), 262(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(239: 2), (251: 1), (258: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 239: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 239: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 258: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 251: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12:
