The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
59(10 to 6), 61(1 to 11), 63(1 to 6), 64(5 to 10), 67(4 to 1), 69(9 to 12), 74(3 to 9), 79(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(67: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 67: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000),
