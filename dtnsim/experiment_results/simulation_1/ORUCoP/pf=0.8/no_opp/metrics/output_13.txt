The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
186(10 to 6), 190(1 to 11), 193(1 to 6), 194(5 to 10), 198(4 to 1), 203(9 to 12), 208(3 to 9), 212(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(193: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(190: 2), (193: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 190: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 193: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 193: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12:
