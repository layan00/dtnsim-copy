The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(10 to 6), 218(1 to 11), 222(1 to 6), 223(5 to 10), 227(4 to 1), 229(9 to 12), 232(3 to 9), 234(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 223: (to: 4, time: 35.000000),
