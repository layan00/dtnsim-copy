The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
240(10 to 6), 243(1 to 11), 245(1 to 6), 246(5 to 10), 250(4 to 1), 252(9 to 12), 255(3 to 9), 260(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(260: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(252: 1), (260: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 260: (to: 1, time: 110.000000), (to: 1, time: 110.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 252: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11:
