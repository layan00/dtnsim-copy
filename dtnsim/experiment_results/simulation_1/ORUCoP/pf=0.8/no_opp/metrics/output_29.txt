The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
249(10 to 6), 253(1 to 11), 257(1 to 6), 258(5 to 10), 262(4 to 1), 264(9 to 12), 268(3 to 9), 274(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 1), (262: 2), (264: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 253: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 262: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 264: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11:
