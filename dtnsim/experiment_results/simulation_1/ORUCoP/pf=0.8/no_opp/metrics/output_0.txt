The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
33(10 to 6), 36(1 to 11), 42(1 to 6), 43(5 to 10), 47(4 to 1), 49(9 to 12), 56(3 to 9), 62(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(43: 35.000000), (47: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(36: 1), (43: 3), (47: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 36: (to: 3, time: 25.000000), 
Node 2:
