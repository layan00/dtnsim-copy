The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
171(10 to 6), 174(1 to 11), 178(1 to 6), 179(5 to 10), 183(4 to 1), 185(9 to 12), 191(3 to 9), 193(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(183: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
