The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
421(10 to 6), 423(1 to 11), 427(1 to 6), 428(5 to 10), 445(4 to 1), 449(9 to 12), 455(3 to 9), 479(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(455: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(428: 4), (445: 3), (449: 3), (455: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
