The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
659(10 to 6), 662(1 to 11), 665(1 to 6), 666(5 to 10), 685(4 to 1), 689(9 to 12), 693(3 to 9), 717(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(689: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(666: 3), (685: 3), (689: 6), (693: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
