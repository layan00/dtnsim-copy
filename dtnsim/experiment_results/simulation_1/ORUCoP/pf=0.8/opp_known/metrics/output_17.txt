The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
642(10 to 6), 645(1 to 11), 649(1 to 6), 650(5 to 10), 667(4 to 1), 671(9 to 12), 676(3 to 9), 702(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(645: 1), (650: 4), (667: 3), (671: 4), (676: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
