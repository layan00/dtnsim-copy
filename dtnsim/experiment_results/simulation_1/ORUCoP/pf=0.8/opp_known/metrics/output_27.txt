The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
631(10 to 6), 634(1 to 11), 638(1 to 6), 639(5 to 10), 659(4 to 1), 667(9 to 12), 673(3 to 9), 703(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(634: 65.000000), (638: 15.000000), (667: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(634: 14), (638: 4), (639: 2), (659: 5), (667: 6), (673: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
