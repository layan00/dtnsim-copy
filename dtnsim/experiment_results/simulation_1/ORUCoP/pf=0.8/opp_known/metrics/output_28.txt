The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
907(10 to 6), 909(1 to 11), 914(1 to 6), 915(5 to 10), 934(4 to 1), 939(9 to 12), 943(3 to 9), 972(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(939: 55.000000), (943: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(915: 4), (934: 5), (939: 6), (943: 8), (972: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
