The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
431(10 to 6), 435(1 to 11), 438(1 to 6), 439(5 to 10), 456(4 to 1), 460(9 to 12), 466(3 to 9), 488(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(466: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(439: 1), (456: 4), (460: 4), (466: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
