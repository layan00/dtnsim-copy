The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1158(10 to 6), 1161(1 to 11), 1163(1 to 6), 1164(5 to 10), 1181(4 to 1), 1185(9 to 12), 1188(3 to 9), 1213(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1213: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1164: 1), (1181: 5), (1185: 3), (1188: 4), (1213: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
