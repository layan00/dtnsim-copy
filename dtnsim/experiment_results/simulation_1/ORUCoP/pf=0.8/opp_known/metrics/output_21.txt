The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
425(10 to 6), 427(1 to 11), 431(1 to 6), 432(5 to 10), 449(4 to 1), 454(9 to 12), 459(3 to 9), 482(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(432: 2), (449: 3), (454: 4), (459: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
