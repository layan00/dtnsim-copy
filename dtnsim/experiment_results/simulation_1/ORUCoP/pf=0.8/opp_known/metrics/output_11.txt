The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
403(10 to 6), 406(1 to 11), 410(1 to 6), 411(5 to 10), 430(4 to 1), 434(9 to 12), 436(3 to 9), 469(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(411: 35.000000), (436: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(411: 4), (430: 4), (434: 4), (436: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
