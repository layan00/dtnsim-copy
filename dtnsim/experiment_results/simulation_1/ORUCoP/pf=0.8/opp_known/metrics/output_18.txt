The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
886(10 to 6), 889(1 to 11), 893(1 to 6), 894(5 to 10), 911(4 to 1), 916(9 to 12), 921(3 to 9), 944(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(921: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(894: 2), (911: 3), (916: 4), (921: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3:
