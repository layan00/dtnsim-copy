The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
383(10 to 6), 385(1 to 11), 387(1 to 6), 388(5 to 10), 404(4 to 1), 408(9 to 12), 412(3 to 9), 437(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(388: 1), (404: 3), (408: 4), (412: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 412: (to: 14, time: 80.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 404: (to: 13, time: 50.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 388: (to: 15, time: 40.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 408: (to: 15, time: 80.000000), (to: 15, time: 80.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Bundle 404: (to: 11, time: 50.000000),
