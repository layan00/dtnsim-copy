The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1127(10 to 6), 1130(1 to 11), 1134(1 to 6), 1135(5 to 10), 1153(4 to 1), 1157(9 to 12), 1161(3 to 9), 1186(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1135: 6), (1153: 3), (1157: 4), (1161: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
