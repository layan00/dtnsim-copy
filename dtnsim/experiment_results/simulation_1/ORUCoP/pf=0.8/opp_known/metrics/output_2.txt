The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(10 to 6), 667(1 to 11), 670(1 to 6), 671(5 to 10), 687(4 to 1), 691(9 to 12), 694(3 to 9), 718(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(687: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(667: 1), (671: 1), (687: 6), (691: 4), (694: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
