The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1169(10 to 6), 1173(1 to 11), 1177(1 to 6), 1178(5 to 10), 1195(4 to 1), 1199(9 to 12), 1203(3 to 9), 1227(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1173: 65.000000), (1203: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1173: 4), (1178: 1), (1195: 4), (1199: 3), (1203: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
