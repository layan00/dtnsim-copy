The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
927(10 to 6), 929(1 to 11), 933(1 to 6), 934(5 to 10), 954(4 to 1), 962(9 to 12), 966(3 to 9), 990(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(962: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(929: 2), (933: 1), (934: 5), (954: 3), (962: 6), (966: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
