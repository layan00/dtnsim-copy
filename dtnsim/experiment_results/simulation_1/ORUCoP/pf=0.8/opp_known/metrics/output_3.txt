The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
901(10 to 6), 903(1 to 11), 906(1 to 6), 907(5 to 10), 923(4 to 1), 927(9 to 12), 931(3 to 9), 957(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(907: 1), (923: 4), (927: 4), (931: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
