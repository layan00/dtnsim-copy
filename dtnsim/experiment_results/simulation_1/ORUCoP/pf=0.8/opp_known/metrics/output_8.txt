The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
923(10 to 6), 927(1 to 11), 932(1 to 6), 933(5 to 10), 951(4 to 1), 955(9 to 12), 960(3 to 9), 987(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(960: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(927: 2), (932: 1), (933: 4), (951: 4), (955: 4), (960: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
