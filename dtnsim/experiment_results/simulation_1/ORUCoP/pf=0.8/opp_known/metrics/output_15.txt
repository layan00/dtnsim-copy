The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
163(10 to 6), 166(1 to 11), 171(1 to 6), 172(5 to 10), 189(4 to 1), 193(9 to 12), 196(3 to 9), 218(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(196: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 1), (189: 3), (193: 3), (196: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
