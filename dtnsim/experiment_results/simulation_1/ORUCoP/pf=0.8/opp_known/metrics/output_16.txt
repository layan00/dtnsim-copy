The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
401(10 to 6), 403(1 to 11), 405(1 to 6), 406(5 to 10), 422(4 to 1), 426(9 to 12), 430(3 to 9), 461(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(430: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(406: 4), (422: 3), (426: 4), (430: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
