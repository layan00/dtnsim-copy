The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
155(10 to 6), 158(1 to 11), 162(1 to 6), 163(5 to 10), 180(4 to 1), 185(9 to 12), 187(3 to 9), 210(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(185: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(163: 2), (180: 4), (185: 6), (187: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
