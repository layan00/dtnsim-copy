The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1178(10 to 6), 1182(1 to 11), 1185(1 to 6), 1186(5 to 10), 1202(4 to 1), 1206(9 to 12), 1210(3 to 9), 1233(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1186: 1), (1202: 3), (1206: 4), (1210: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 1210: (to: 4, time: 65.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 1202: (to: 13, time: 50.000000), (to: 13, time: 80.000000),
