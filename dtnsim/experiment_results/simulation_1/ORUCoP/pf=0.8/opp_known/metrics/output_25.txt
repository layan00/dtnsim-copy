The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
150(10 to 6), 153(1 to 11), 155(1 to 6), 156(5 to 10), 172(4 to 1), 176(9 to 12), 179(3 to 9), 202(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(156: 1), (172: 3), (176: 4), (179: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 179: (to: 14, time: 80.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000),
