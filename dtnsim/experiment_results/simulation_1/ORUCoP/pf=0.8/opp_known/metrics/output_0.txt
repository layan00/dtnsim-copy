The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
165(10 to 6), 168(1 to 11), 175(1 to 6), 176(5 to 10), 194(4 to 1), 198(9 to 12), 205(3 to 9), 232(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(176: 35.000000), (194: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(168: 4), (176: 4), (194: 6), (198: 4), (205: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 118 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
