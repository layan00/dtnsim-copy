The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
904(10 to 6), 908(1 to 11), 911(1 to 6), 912(5 to 10), 929(4 to 1), 940(9 to 12), 944(3 to 9), 972(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(911: 15.000000), (940: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(908: 4), (911: 6), (912: 1), (929: 4), (940: 6), (944: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
