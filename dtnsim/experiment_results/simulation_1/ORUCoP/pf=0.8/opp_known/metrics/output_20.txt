The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
165(10 to 6), 170(1 to 11), 175(1 to 6), 176(5 to 10), 195(4 to 1), 203(9 to 12), 209(3 to 9), 237(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(175: 15.000000), (209: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(170: 6), (175: 4), (176: 4), (195: 3), (203: 3), (209: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
