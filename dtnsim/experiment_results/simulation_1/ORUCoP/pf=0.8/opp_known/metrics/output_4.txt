The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1146(10 to 6), 1151(1 to 11), 1155(1 to 6), 1156(5 to 10), 1174(4 to 1), 1178(9 to 12), 1186(3 to 9), 1211(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1151: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1151: 4), (1156: 4), (1174: 3), (1178: 3), (1186: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
