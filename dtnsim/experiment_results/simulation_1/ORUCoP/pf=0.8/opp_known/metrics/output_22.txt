The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
668(10 to 6), 671(1 to 11), 673(1 to 6), 674(5 to 10), 692(4 to 1), 704(9 to 12), 707(3 to 9), 740(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(673: 15.000000), (707: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(671: 5), (673: 6), (674: 1), (692: 3), (704: 4), (707: 10), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
