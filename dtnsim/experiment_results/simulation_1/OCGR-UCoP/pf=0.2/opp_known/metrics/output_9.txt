The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1529(10 to 6), 1533(1 to 11), 1539(1 to 6), 1540(5 to 10), 1559(4 to 1), 1562(9 to 12), 1573(3 to 9), 1597(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1529: 45.000000), (1539: 25.000000), (1559: 140.000000), (1562: 0.000000), (1573: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1529: 4), (1533: 2), (1539: 2), (1540: 3), (1559: 6), (1562: 3), (1573: 5), (1597: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
