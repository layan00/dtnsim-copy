The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
848(10 to 6), 852(1 to 11), 856(1 to 6), 857(5 to 10), 878(4 to 1), 880(9 to 12), 892(3 to 9), 914(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(852: 35.000000), (856: 25.000000), (857: 35.000000), (878: 140.000000), (880: 0.000000), (914: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(848: 3), (852: 4), (856: 2), (857: 4), (878: 6), (880: 3), (892: 4), (914: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
