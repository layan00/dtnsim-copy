The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
528(10 to 6), 533(1 to 11), 539(1 to 6), 540(5 to 10), 558(4 to 1), 563(9 to 12), 569(3 to 9), 594(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(528: 105.000000), (539: 15.000000), (540: 35.000000), (558: 60.000000), (563: 55.000000), (569: 15.000000), (594: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(528: 6), (533: 4), (539: 4), (540: 4), (558: 4), (563: 4), (569: 5), (594: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
