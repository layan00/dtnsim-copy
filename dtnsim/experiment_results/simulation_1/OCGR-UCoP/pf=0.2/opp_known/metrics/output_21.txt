The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
543(10 to 6), 547(1 to 11), 555(1 to 6), 556(5 to 10), 575(4 to 1), 577(9 to 12), 589(3 to 9), 613(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(543: 105.000000), (555: 25.000000), (556: 35.000000), (577: 0.000000), (589: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(543: 5), (547: 2), (555: 2), (556: 4), (575: 2), (577: 3), (589: 5), (613: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
