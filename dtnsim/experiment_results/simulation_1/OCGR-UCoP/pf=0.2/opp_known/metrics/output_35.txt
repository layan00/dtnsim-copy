The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(10 to 6), 222(1 to 11), 229(1 to 6), 230(5 to 10), 248(4 to 1), 252(9 to 12), 265(3 to 9), 290(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(222: 35.000000), (229: 15.000000), (230: 35.000000), (248: 140.000000), (252: 0.000000), (265: 15.000000), (290: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 1), (222: 3), (229: 3), (230: 3), (248: 6), (252: 3), (265: 5), (290: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
