The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
545(10 to 6), 550(1 to 11), 557(1 to 6), 558(5 to 10), 576(4 to 1), 581(9 to 12), 591(3 to 9), 616(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(545: 55.000000), (557: 15.000000), (558: 35.000000), (576: 60.000000), (581: 0.000000), (591: 15.000000), (616: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(545: 3), (550: 4), (557: 3), (558: 3), (576: 4), (581: 3), (591: 5), (616: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 4 calls to RUCoP, which took 7 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
