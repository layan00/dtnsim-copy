The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(10 to 6), 218(1 to 11), 224(1 to 6), 225(5 to 10), 243(4 to 1), 248(9 to 12), 258(3 to 9), 279(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 105.000000), (224: 15.000000), (243: 60.000000), (248: 0.000000), (279: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 5), (218: 3), (224: 4), (225: 3), (243: 4), (248: 3), (258: 4), (279: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
