The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1196(10 to 6), 1201(1 to 11), 1208(1 to 6), 1209(5 to 10), 1228(4 to 1), 1232(9 to 12), 1242(3 to 9), 1266(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1196: 45.000000), (1208: 25.000000), (1232: 0.000000), (1242: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1196: 4), (1201: 4), (1208: 2), (1209: 3), (1228: 4), (1232: 3), (1242: 5), (1266: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
