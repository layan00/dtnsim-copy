The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
870(10 to 6), 875(1 to 11), 881(1 to 6), 882(5 to 10), 898(4 to 1), 902(9 to 12), 915(3 to 9), 941(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(875: 35.000000), (881: 15.000000), (882: 35.000000), (898: 140.000000), (902: 0.000000), (915: 15.000000), (941: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(870: 1), (875: 3), (881: 3), (882: 3), (898: 6), (902: 3), (915: 5), (941: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 6 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
