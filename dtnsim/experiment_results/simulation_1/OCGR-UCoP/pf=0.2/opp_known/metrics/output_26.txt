The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
536(10 to 6), 542(1 to 11), 550(1 to 6), 551(5 to 10), 572(4 to 1), 575(9 to 12), 589(3 to 9), 608(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(536: 45.000000), (542: 35.000000), (550: 25.000000), (551: 55.000000), (575: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(536: 4), (542: 3), (550: 2), (551: 5), (572: 3), (575: 3), (589: 4), (608: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
