The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1495(10 to 6), 1499(1 to 11), 1506(1 to 6), 1507(5 to 10), 1527(4 to 1), 1528(9 to 12), 1542(3 to 9), 1566(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1499: 35.000000), (1506: 25.000000), (1507: 35.000000), (1527: 140.000000), (1528: 0.000000), (1542: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1495: 1), (1499: 3), (1506: 2), (1507: 4), (1527: 6), (1528: 3), (1542: 5), (1566: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
