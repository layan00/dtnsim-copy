The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
543(10 to 6), 548(1 to 11), 556(1 to 6), 557(5 to 10), 577(4 to 1), 580(9 to 12), 591(3 to 9), 617(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(543: 45.000000), (556: 25.000000), (557: 35.000000), (577: 60.000000), (580: 0.000000), (591: 15.000000), (617: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(543: 4), (548: 2), (556: 2), (557: 4), (577: 4), (580: 3), (591: 5), (617: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
