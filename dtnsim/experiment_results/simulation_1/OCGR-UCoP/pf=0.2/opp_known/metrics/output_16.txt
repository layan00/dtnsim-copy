The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
532(10 to 6), 538(1 to 11), 543(1 to 6), 544(5 to 10), 562(4 to 1), 563(9 to 12), 574(3 to 9), 598(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(532: 105.000000), (538: 35.000000), (562: 60.000000), (563: 55.000000), (574: 15.000000), (598: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(532: 5), (538: 3), (543: 2), (544: 3), (562: 4), (563: 4), (574: 5), (598: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
