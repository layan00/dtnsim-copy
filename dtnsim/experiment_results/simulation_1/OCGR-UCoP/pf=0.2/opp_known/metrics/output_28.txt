The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1178(10 to 6), 1181(1 to 11), 1188(1 to 6), 1189(5 to 10), 1209(4 to 1), 1211(9 to 12), 1221(3 to 9), 1246(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1188: 25.000000), (1189: 35.000000), (1211: 0.000000), (1221: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1178: 1), (1181: 4), (1188: 2), (1189: 4), (1209: 4), (1211: 3), (1221: 5), (1246: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
