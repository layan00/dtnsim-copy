The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(10 to 6), 214(1 to 11), 219(1 to 6), 220(5 to 10), 239(4 to 1), 244(9 to 12), 255(3 to 9), 281(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 55.000000), (219: 15.000000), (239: 60.000000), (244: 0.000000), (255: 15.000000), (281: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(211: 1), (214: 6), (219: 4), (220: 3), (239: 4), (244: 3), (255: 5), (281: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
