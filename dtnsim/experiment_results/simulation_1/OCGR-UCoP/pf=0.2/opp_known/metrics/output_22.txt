The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
859(10 to 6), 865(1 to 11), 871(1 to 6), 872(5 to 10), 893(4 to 1), 894(9 to 12), 906(3 to 9), 932(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(865: 35.000000), (871: 25.000000), (872: 35.000000), (894: 0.000000), (906: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(859: 1), (865: 3), (871: 2), (872: 4), (893: 6), (894: 3), (906: 5), (932: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
