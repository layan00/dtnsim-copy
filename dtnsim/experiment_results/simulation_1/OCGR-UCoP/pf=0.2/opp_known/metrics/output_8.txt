The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1205(10 to 6), 1211(1 to 11), 1219(1 to 6), 1220(5 to 10), 1240(4 to 1), 1241(9 to 12), 1255(3 to 9), 1280(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1211: 35.000000), (1219: 25.000000), (1220: 35.000000), (1240: 60.000000), (1241: 0.000000), (1255: 15.000000), (1280: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1205: 1), (1211: 3), (1219: 2), (1220: 4), (1240: 4), (1241: 3), (1255: 5), (1280: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
