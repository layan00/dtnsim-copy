The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1181(10 to 6), 1187(1 to 11), 1196(1 to 6), 1197(5 to 10), 1218(4 to 1), 1221(9 to 12), 1229(3 to 9), 1255(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1181: 45.000000), (1197: 35.000000), (1221: 0.000000), (1229: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1181: 4), (1187: 3), (1196: 2), (1197: 4), (1218: 3), (1221: 3), (1229: 5), (1255: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
