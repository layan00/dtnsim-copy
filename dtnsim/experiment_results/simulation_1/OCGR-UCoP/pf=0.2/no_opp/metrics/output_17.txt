The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
353(10 to 6), 357(1 to 11), 364(1 to 6), 365(5 to 10), 368(4 to 1), 369(9 to 12), 381(3 to 9), 391(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(353: 55.000000), (357: 35.000000), (364: 25.000000), (381: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(353: 4), (357: 3), (364: 2), (365: 1), (368: 3), (369: 1), (381: 4), (391: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
