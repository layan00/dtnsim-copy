The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(10 to 6), 233(1 to 11), 241(1 to 6), 242(5 to 10), 248(4 to 1), 251(9 to 12), 262(3 to 9), 272(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(228: 45.000000), (241: 25.000000), (242: 35.000000), (248: 60.000000), (251: 55.000000), (272: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 4), (233: 2), (241: 2), (242: 3), (248: 4), (251: 4), (262: 5), (272: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
