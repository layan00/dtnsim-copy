The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(10 to 6), 217(1 to 11), 223(1 to 6), 224(5 to 10), 228(4 to 1), 231(9 to 12), 236(3 to 9), 245(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 105.000000), (223: 25.000000), (228: 60.000000), (236: 65.000000), (245: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 6), (217: 3), (223: 3), (224: 2), (228: 4), (231: 1), (236: 4), (245: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
