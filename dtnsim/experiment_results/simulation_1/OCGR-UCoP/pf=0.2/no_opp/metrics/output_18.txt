The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
486(10 to 6), 492(1 to 11), 500(1 to 6), 501(5 to 10), 506(4 to 1), 509(9 to 12), 521(3 to 9), 529(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(486: 45.000000), (492: 35.000000), (500: 25.000000), (501: 35.000000), (506: 60.000000), (521: 65.000000), (529: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(486: 4), (492: 3), (500: 2), (501: 3), (506: 4), (509: 1), (521: 5), (529: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
