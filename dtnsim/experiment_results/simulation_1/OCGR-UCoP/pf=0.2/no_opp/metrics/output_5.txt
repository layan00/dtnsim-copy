The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
83(10 to 6), 89(1 to 11), 98(1 to 6), 99(5 to 10), 105(4 to 1), 108(9 to 12), 120(3 to 9), 128(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(83: 45.000000), (89: 35.000000), (98: 25.000000), (99: 35.000000), (120: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(83: 4), (89: 3), (98: 2), (99: 3), (105: 4), (108: 1), (120: 5), (128: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
