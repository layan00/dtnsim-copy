The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
368(10 to 6), 373(1 to 11), 379(1 to 6), 380(5 to 10), 384(4 to 1), 386(9 to 12), 397(3 to 9), 406(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(373: 35.000000), (379: 25.000000), (380: 35.000000), (397: 65.000000), (406: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(368: 1), (373: 3), (379: 3), (380: 3), (384: 1), (386: 1), (397: 4), (406: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
