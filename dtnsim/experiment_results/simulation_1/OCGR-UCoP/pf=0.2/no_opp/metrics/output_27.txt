The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
358(10 to 6), 364(1 to 11), 370(1 to 6), 371(5 to 10), 378(4 to 1), 379(9 to 12), 392(3 to 9), 404(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(364: 35.000000), (370: 25.000000), (371: 35.000000), (379: 55.000000), (392: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(358: 1), (364: 3), (370: 2), (371: 3), (378: 3), (379: 4), (392: 4), (404: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
