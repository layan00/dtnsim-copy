The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
627(10 to 6), 631(1 to 11), 638(1 to 6), 639(5 to 10), 645(4 to 1), 646(9 to 12), 660(3 to 9), 667(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(631: 35.000000), (638: 25.000000), (639: 35.000000), (660: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(627: 1), (631: 3), (638: 2), (639: 3), (645: 1), (646: 3), (660: 4), (667: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
