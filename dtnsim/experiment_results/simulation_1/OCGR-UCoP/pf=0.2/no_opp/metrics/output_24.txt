The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
632(10 to 6), 639(1 to 11), 647(1 to 6), 648(5 to 10), 654(4 to 1), 657(9 to 12), 668(3 to 9), 679(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(632: 45.000000), (639: 35.000000), (654: 60.000000), (657: 55.000000), (668: 65.000000), (679: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(632: 4), (639: 3), (647: 2), (648: 1), (654: 4), (657: 4), (668: 4), (679: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
