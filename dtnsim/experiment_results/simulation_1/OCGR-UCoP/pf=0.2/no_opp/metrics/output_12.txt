The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
343(10 to 6), 347(1 to 11), 351(1 to 6), 352(5 to 10), 359(4 to 1), 361(9 to 12), 373(3 to 9), 379(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(347: 35.000000), (351: 25.000000), (352: 35.000000), (373: 65.000000), (379: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(343: 3), (347: 4), (351: 2), (352: 3), (359: 1), (361: 3), (373: 5), (379: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
