The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(10 to 6), 221(1 to 11), 226(1 to 6), 227(5 to 10), 231(4 to 1), 232(9 to 12), 243(3 to 9), 253(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 105.000000), (221: 35.000000), (231: 60.000000), (232: 55.000000), (243: 65.000000), (253: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 5), (221: 3), (226: 2), (227: 1), (231: 4), (232: 4), (243: 4), (253: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
