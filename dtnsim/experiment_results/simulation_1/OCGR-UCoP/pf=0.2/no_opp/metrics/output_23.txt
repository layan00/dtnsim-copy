The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
488(10 to 6), 494(1 to 11), 503(1 to 6), 504(5 to 10), 511(4 to 1), 514(9 to 12), 521(3 to 9), 532(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(488: 45.000000), (514: 55.000000), (521: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(488: 4), (494: 2), (503: 2), (504: 2), (511: 3), (514: 4), (521: 4), (532: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
