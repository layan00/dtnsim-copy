The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
502(10 to 6), 507(1 to 11), 514(1 to 6), 515(5 to 10), 520(4 to 1), 524(9 to 12), 531(3 to 9), 540(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(502: 45.000000), (514: 25.000000), (531: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(502: 4), (507: 3), (514: 2), (515: 1), (520: 4), (524: 1), (531: 4), (540: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
