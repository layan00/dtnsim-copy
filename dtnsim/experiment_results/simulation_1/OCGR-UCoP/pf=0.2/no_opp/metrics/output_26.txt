The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(10 to 6), 221(1 to 11), 229(1 to 6), 230(5 to 10), 237(4 to 1), 240(9 to 12), 254(3 to 9), 261(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 45.000000), (221: 35.000000), (229: 25.000000), (230: 55.000000), (240: 55.000000), (254: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 4), (221: 3), (229: 2), (230: 4), (237: 3), (240: 4), (254: 5), (261: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
