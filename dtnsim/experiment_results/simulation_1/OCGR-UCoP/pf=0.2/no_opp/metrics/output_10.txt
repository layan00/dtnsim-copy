The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(10 to 6), 86(1 to 11), 92(1 to 6), 93(5 to 10), 97(4 to 1), 100(9 to 12), 110(3 to 9), 119(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 105.000000), (92: 25.000000), (97: 60.000000), (100: 55.000000), (119: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 5), (86: 2), (92: 3), (93: 1), (97: 4), (100: 4), (110: 3), (119: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
