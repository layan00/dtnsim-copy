The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
666(10 to 6), 670(1 to 11), 676(1 to 6), 677(5 to 10), 682(4 to 1), 685(9 to 12), 695(3 to 9), 700(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(666: 45.000000), (676: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(666: 4), (670: 2), (676: 2), (677: 1), (682: 1), (685: 3), (695: 2), (700: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 670: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
