The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
497(10 to 6), 500(1 to 11), 507(1 to 6), 508(5 to 10), 514(4 to 1), 516(9 to 12), 523(3 to 9), 532(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(507: 25.000000), (523: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(497: 1), (500: 3), (507: 2), (508: 2), (514: 4), (516: 1), (523: 4), (532: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
