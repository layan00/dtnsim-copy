The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(10 to 6), 87(1 to 11), 93(1 to 6), 94(5 to 10), 99(4 to 1), 100(9 to 12), 113(3 to 9), 121(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 55.000000), (93: 25.000000), (94: 35.000000), (121: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 4), (87: 2), (93: 2), (94: 3), (99: 1), (100: 3), (113: 3), (121: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
