The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
376(10 to 6), 382(1 to 11), 389(1 to 6), 390(5 to 10), 397(4 to 1), 398(9 to 12), 410(3 to 9), 422(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(376: 105.000000), (382: 35.000000), (389: 25.000000), (390: 35.000000), (397: 60.000000), (398: 55.000000), (410: 65.000000), (422: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(376: 5), (382: 3), (389: 2), (390: 3), (397: 4), (398: 4), (410: 4), (422: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
