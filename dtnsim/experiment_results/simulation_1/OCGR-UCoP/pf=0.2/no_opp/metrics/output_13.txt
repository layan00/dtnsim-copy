The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(10 to 6), 488(1 to 11), 496(1 to 6), 497(5 to 10), 503(4 to 1), 505(9 to 12), 519(3 to 9), 531(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(481: 105.000000), (488: 35.000000), (496: 25.000000), (497: 35.000000), (505: 55.000000), (519: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 5), (488: 3), (496: 2), (497: 3), (503: 4), (505: 4), (519: 4), (531: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
