The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
636(10 to 6), 642(1 to 11), 648(1 to 6), 649(5 to 10), 655(4 to 1), 656(9 to 12), 668(3 to 9), 680(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(636: 105.000000), (642: 35.000000), (649: 35.000000), (655: 60.000000), (656: 55.000000), (668: 65.000000), (680: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 5), (642: 3), (648: 2), (649: 3), (655: 4), (656: 4), (668: 4), (680: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
