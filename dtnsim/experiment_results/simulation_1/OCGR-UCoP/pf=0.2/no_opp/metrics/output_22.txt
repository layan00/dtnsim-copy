The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
356(10 to 6), 362(1 to 11), 368(1 to 6), 369(5 to 10), 376(4 to 1), 377(9 to 12), 388(3 to 9), 395(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(362: 35.000000), (368: 25.000000), (369: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(356: 1), (362: 3), (368: 2), (369: 3), (376: 1), (377: 2), (388: 4), (395: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
