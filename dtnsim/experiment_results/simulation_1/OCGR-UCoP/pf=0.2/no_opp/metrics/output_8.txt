The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(10 to 6), 533(1 to 11), 541(1 to 6), 542(5 to 10), 548(4 to 1), 549(9 to 12), 561(3 to 9), 571(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(533: 35.000000), (541: 25.000000), (542: 35.000000), (548: 60.000000), (561: 65.000000), (571: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 1), (533: 3), (541: 2), (542: 3), (548: 4), (549: 1), (561: 4), (571: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
