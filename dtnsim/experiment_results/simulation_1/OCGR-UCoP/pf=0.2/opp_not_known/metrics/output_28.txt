The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1545(10 to 6), 1560(1 to 11), 1567(1 to 6), 1568(5 to 10), 1597(4 to 1), 1602(9 to 12), 1623(3 to 9), 1660(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1567: 15.000000), (1568: 55.000000), (1602: 0.000000), (1623: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1545: 1), (1560: 4), (1567: 3), (1568: 5), (1597: 4), (1602: 3), (1623: 4), (1660: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 73 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
