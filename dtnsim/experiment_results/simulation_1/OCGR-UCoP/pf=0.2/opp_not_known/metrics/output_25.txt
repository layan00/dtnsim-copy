The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(10 to 6), 243(1 to 11), 249(1 to 6), 250(5 to 10), 279(4 to 1), 280(9 to 12), 305(3 to 9), 341(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 55.000000), (249: 25.000000), (250: 35.000000), (279: 140.000000), (305: 15.000000), (341: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 3), (243: 2), (249: 2), (250: 3), (279: 6), (280: 4), (305: 4), (341: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 79 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
