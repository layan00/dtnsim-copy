The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
675(10 to 6), 692(1 to 11), 699(1 to 6), 700(5 to 10), 730(4 to 1), 735(9 to 12), 757(3 to 9), 789(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(675: 55.000000), (699: 15.000000), (700: 35.000000), (730: 60.000000), (735: 0.000000), (757: 65.000000), (789: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(675: 3), (692: 3), (699: 3), (700: 3), (730: 4), (735: 3), (757: 5), (789: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 62 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
