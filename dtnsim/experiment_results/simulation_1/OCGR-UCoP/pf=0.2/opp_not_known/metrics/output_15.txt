The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(10 to 6), 238(1 to 11), 243(1 to 6), 244(5 to 10), 275(4 to 1), 281(9 to 12), 305(3 to 9), 344(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 55.000000), (243: 15.000000), (275: 60.000000), (281: 0.000000), (305: 15.000000), (344: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 1), (238: 6), (243: 3), (244: 9), (275: 4), (281: 3), (305: 4), (344: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
