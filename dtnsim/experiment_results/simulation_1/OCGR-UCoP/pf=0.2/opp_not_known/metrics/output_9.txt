The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2012(10 to 6), 2028(1 to 11), 2034(1 to 6), 2035(5 to 10), 2066(4 to 1), 2068(9 to 12), 2094(3 to 9), 2126(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2012: 55.000000), (2034: 25.000000), (2035: 35.000000), (2066: 140.000000), (2068: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2012: 3), (2028: 2), (2034: 2), (2035: 7), (2066: 6), (2068: 3), (2094: 2), (2126: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
