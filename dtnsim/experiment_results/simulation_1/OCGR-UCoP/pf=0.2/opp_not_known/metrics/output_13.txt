The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1543(10 to 6), 1562(1 to 11), 1570(1 to 6), 1571(5 to 10), 1601(4 to 1), 1602(9 to 12), 1630(3 to 9), 1667(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1543: 55.000000), (1562: 35.000000), (1570: 25.000000), (1571: 35.000000), (1602: 0.000000), (1630: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1543: 3), (1562: 3), (1570: 2), (1571: 3), (1601: 4), (1602: 3), (1630: 4), (1667: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 66 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
