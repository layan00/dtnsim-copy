The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
667(10 to 6), 685(1 to 11), 690(1 to 6), 691(5 to 10), 721(4 to 1), 723(9 to 12), 748(3 to 9), 783(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(667: 105.000000), (685: 35.000000), (691: 55.000000), (721: 60.000000), (723: 55.000000), (748: 15.000000), (783: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(667: 5), (685: 3), (690: 2), (691: 8), (721: 4), (723: 4), (748: 4), (783: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
