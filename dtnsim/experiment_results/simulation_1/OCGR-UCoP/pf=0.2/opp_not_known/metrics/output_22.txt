The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1107(10 to 6), 1125(1 to 11), 1131(1 to 6), 1132(5 to 10), 1163(4 to 1), 1164(9 to 12), 1189(3 to 9), 1222(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1125: 35.000000), (1131: 25.000000), (1132: 35.000000), (1164: 0.000000), (1189: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1107: 1), (1125: 3), (1131: 2), (1132: 3), (1163: 6), (1164: 3), (1189: 6), (1222: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 72 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
