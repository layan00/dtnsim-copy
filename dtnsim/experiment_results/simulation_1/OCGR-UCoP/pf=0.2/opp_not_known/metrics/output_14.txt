The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1993(10 to 6), 2012(1 to 11), 2020(1 to 6), 2021(5 to 10), 2051(4 to 1), 2052(9 to 12), 2080(3 to 9), 2116(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1993: 55.000000), (2012: 35.000000), (2020: 25.000000), (2021: 35.000000), (2051: 60.000000), (2052: 0.000000), (2080: 15.000000), (2116: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1993: 3), (2012: 3), (2020: 2), (2021: 3), (2051: 4), (2052: 3), (2080: 4), (2116: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 6 calls to RUCoP, which took 46 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
