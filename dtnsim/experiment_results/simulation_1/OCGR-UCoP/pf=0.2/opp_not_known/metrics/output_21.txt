The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
674(10 to 6), 690(1 to 11), 698(1 to 6), 699(5 to 10), 728(4 to 1), 729(9 to 12), 755(3 to 9), 790(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 55.000000), (698: 25.000000), (699: 35.000000), (729: 0.000000), (755: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(674: 3), (690: 2), (698: 2), (699: 3), (728: 2), (729: 3), (755: 4), (790: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 69 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
