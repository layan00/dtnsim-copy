The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1991(10 to 6), 2007(1 to 11), 2014(1 to 6), 2015(5 to 10), 2045(4 to 1), 2046(9 to 12), 2073(3 to 9), 2108(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2007: 35.000000), (2014: 25.000000), (2015: 35.000000), (2045: 140.000000), (2046: 0.000000), (2073: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1991: 1), (2007: 3), (2014: 2), (2015: 3), (2045: 6), (2046: 3), (2073: 4), (2108: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 68 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
