The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
666(10 to 6), 684(1 to 11), 692(1 to 6), 693(5 to 10), 724(4 to 1), 725(9 to 12), 753(3 to 9), 783(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(666: 55.000000), (684: 35.000000), (692: 25.000000), (693: 55.000000), (725: 0.000000), (753: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(666: 3), (684: 3), (692: 2), (693: 4), (724: 3), (725: 3), (753: 5), (783: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 68 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
