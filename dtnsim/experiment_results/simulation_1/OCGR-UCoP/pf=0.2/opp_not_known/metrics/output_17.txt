The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1110(10 to 6), 1126(1 to 11), 1133(1 to 6), 1134(5 to 10), 1163(4 to 1), 1164(9 to 12), 1190(3 to 9), 1226(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1110: 55.000000), (1126: 35.000000), (1133: 25.000000), (1164: 55.000000), (1190: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1110: 3), (1126: 3), (1133: 2), (1134: 4), (1163: 3), (1164: 4), (1190: 4), (1226: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
