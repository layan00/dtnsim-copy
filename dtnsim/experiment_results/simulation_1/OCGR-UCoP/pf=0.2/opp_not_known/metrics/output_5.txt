The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(10 to 6), 245(1 to 11), 254(1 to 6), 255(5 to 10), 285(4 to 1), 286(9 to 12), 314(3 to 9), 346(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 55.000000), (245: 35.000000), (254: 25.000000), (255: 35.000000), (286: 0.000000), (314: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 3), (245: 3), (254: 2), (255: 3), (285: 4), (286: 3), (314: 5), (346: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 66 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
