The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
674(10 to 6), 691(1 to 11), 699(1 to 6), 700(5 to 10), 730(4 to 1), 731(9 to 12), 756(3 to 9), 789(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 55.000000), (699: 25.000000), (700: 35.000000), (730: 60.000000), (731: 0.000000), (789: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(674: 3), (691: 2), (699: 2), (700: 3), (730: 4), (731: 3), (756: 5), (789: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 56 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
