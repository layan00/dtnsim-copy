The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1547(10 to 6), 1565(1 to 11), 1574(1 to 6), 1575(5 to 10), 1606(4 to 1), 1607(9 to 12), 1628(3 to 9), 1666(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1547: 55.000000), (1575: 55.000000), (1607: 0.000000), (1628: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1547: 3), (1565: 2), (1574: 2), (1575: 5), (1606: 3), (1607: 3), (1628: 4), (1666: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
