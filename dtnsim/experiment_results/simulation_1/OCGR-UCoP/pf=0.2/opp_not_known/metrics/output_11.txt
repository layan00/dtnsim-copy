The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
661(10 to 6), 678(1 to 11), 684(1 to 6), 685(5 to 10), 713(4 to 1), 718(9 to 12), 736(3 to 9), 773(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(661: 105.000000), (684: 15.000000), (685: 55.000000), (713: 60.000000), (718: 55.000000), (736: 15.000000), (773: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(661: 5), (678: 3), (684: 3), (685: 5), (713: 4), (718: 4), (736: 4), (773: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 90 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
