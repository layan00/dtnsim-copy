The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(10 to 6), 246(1 to 11), 255(1 to 6), 256(5 to 10), 287(4 to 1), 288(9 to 12), 314(3 to 9), 345(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(228: 55.000000), (246: 35.000000), (255: 25.000000), (256: 35.000000), (287: 140.000000), (288: 0.000000), (314: 65.000000), (345: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 3), (246: 3), (255: 2), (256: 3), (287: 6), (288: 3), (314: 5), (345: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 63 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
