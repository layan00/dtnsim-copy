The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2000(10 to 6), 2018(1 to 11), 2024(1 to 6), 2025(5 to 10), 2055(4 to 1), 2056(9 to 12), 2080(3 to 9), 2117(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2000: 105.000000), (2018: 35.000000), (2025: 35.000000), (2055: 60.000000), (2056: 55.000000), (2080: 15.000000), (2117: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2000: 5), (2018: 3), (2024: 2), (2025: 3), (2055: 4), (2056: 4), (2080: 4), (2117: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 69 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
