The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1570(10 to 6), 1588(1 to 11), 1596(1 to 6), 1597(5 to 10), 1627(4 to 1), 1628(9 to 12), 1655(3 to 9), 1691(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1588: 35.000000), (1596: 25.000000), (1597: 35.000000), (1627: 60.000000), (1628: 0.000000), (1655: 15.000000), (1691: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1570: 1), (1588: 3), (1596: 2), (1597: 3), (1627: 4), (1628: 3), (1655: 4), (1691: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 54 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
