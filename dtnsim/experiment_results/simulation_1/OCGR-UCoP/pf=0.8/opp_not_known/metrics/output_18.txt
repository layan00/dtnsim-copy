The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1337(10 to 6), 1351(1 to 11), 1354(1 to 6), 1355(5 to 10), 1383(4 to 1), 1384(9 to 12), 1404(3 to 9), 1430(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1384: 0.000000), (1404: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1337: 1), (1351: 2), (1354: 1), (1355: 4), (1383: 3), (1384: 3), (1404: 6), (1430: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 109 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
