The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
593(10 to 6), 607(1 to 11), 610(1 to 6), 611(5 to 10), 639(4 to 1), 641(9 to 12), 658(3 to 9), 686(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(593: 3), (607: 2), (610: 1), (611: 5), (639: 5), (641: 4), (658: 2), (686: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 153 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
