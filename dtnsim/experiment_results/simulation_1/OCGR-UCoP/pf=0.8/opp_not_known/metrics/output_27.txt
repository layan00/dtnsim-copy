The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
955(10 to 6), 969(1 to 11), 971(1 to 6), 972(5 to 10), 1001(4 to 1), 1006(9 to 12), 1025(3 to 9), 1057(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(969: 55.000000), (971: 15.000000), (1006: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(955: 1), (969: 6), (971: 3), (972: 4), (1001: 5), (1006: 3), (1025: 2), (1057: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 140 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
