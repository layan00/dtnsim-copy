The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1745(10 to 6), 1759(1 to 11), 1760(1 to 6), 1761(5 to 10), 1790(4 to 1), 1791(9 to 12), 1807(3 to 9), 1836(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1791: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1745: 1), (1759: 2), (1760: 1), (1761: 4), (1790: 5), (1791: 3), (1807: 2), (1836: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 121 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
