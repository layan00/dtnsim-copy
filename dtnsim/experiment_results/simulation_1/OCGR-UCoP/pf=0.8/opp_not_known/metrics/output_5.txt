The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(10 to 6), 215(1 to 11), 219(1 to 6), 220(5 to 10), 248(4 to 1), 253(9 to 12), 270(3 to 9), 298(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 15.000000), (253: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 1), (215: 3), (219: 3), (220: 4), (248: 5), (253: 4), (270: 2), (298: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 147 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
