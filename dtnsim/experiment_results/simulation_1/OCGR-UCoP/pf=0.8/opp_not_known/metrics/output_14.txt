The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1734(10 to 6), 1748(1 to 11), 1749(1 to 6), 1750(5 to 10), 1778(4 to 1), 1780(9 to 12), 1795(3 to 9), 1825(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1825: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1734: 1), (1748: 2), (1749: 1), (1750: 5), (1778: 5), (1780: 4), (1795: 2), (1825: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 114 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
