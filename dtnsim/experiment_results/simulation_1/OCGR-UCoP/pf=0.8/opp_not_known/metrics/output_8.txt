The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1365(10 to 6), 1380(1 to 11), 1383(1 to 6), 1384(5 to 10), 1412(4 to 1), 1413(9 to 12), 1431(3 to 9), 1458(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1365: 1), (1380: 2), (1383: 2), (1384: 4), (1412: 3), (1413: 4), (1431: 2), (1458: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
