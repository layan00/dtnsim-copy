The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1740(10 to 6), 1755(1 to 11), 1758(1 to 6), 1759(5 to 10), 1787(4 to 1), 1789(9 to 12), 1805(3 to 9), 1833(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1740: 1), (1755: 2), (1758: 2), (1759: 5), (1787: 3), (1789: 4), (1805: 2), (1833: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 153 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
