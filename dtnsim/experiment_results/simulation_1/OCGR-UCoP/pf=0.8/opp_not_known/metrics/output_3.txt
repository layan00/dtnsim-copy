The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1349(10 to 6), 1362(1 to 11), 1364(1 to 6), 1365(5 to 10), 1392(4 to 1), 1393(9 to 12), 1410(3 to 9), 1440(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1349: 1), (1362: 2), (1364: 1), (1365: 4), (1392: 5), (1393: 4), (1410: 3), (1440: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 142 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
