The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
572(10 to 6), 586(1 to 11), 587(1 to 6), 588(5 to 10), 615(4 to 1), 616(9 to 12), 634(3 to 9), 663(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 4), (586: 2), (587: 1), (588: 4), (615: 3), (616: 4), (634: 3), (663: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 149 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
