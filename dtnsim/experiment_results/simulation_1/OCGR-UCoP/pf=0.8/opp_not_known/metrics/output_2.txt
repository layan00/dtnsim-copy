The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
971(10 to 6), 985(1 to 11), 987(1 to 6), 988(5 to 10), 1015(4 to 1), 1016(9 to 12), 1032(3 to 9), 1060(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1015: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(971: 1), (985: 2), (987: 2), (988: 4), (1015: 7), (1016: 4), (1032: 2), (1060: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 154 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
