The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(10 to 6), 214(1 to 11), 217(1 to 6), 218(5 to 10), 246(4 to 1), 247(9 to 12), 263(3 to 9), 290(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 1), (214: 2), (217: 1), (218: 4), (246: 6), (247: 3), (263: 2), (290: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 214: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
