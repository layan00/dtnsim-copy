The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
204(10 to 6), 218(1 to 11), 222(1 to 6), 223(5 to 10), 251(4 to 1), 253(9 to 12), 268(3 to 9), 296(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(268: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(204: 1), (218: 2), (222: 1), (223: 5), (251: 5), (253: 4), (268: 6), (296: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
