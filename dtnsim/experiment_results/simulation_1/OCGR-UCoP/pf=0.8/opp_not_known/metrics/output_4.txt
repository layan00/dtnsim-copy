The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1729(10 to 6), 1745(1 to 11), 1748(1 to 6), 1749(5 to 10), 1778(4 to 1), 1780(9 to 12), 1799(3 to 9), 1829(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1745: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1729: 1), (1745: 5), (1748: 2), (1749: 5), (1778: 5), (1780: 4), (1799: 2), (1829: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 147 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
