The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
970(10 to 6), 984(1 to 11), 985(1 to 6), 986(5 to 10), 1015(4 to 1), 1020(9 to 12), 1037(3 to 9), 1063(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(985: 15.000000), (1037: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(970: 1), (984: 3), (985: 3), (986: 4), (1015: 3), (1020: 4), (1037: 6), (1063: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 147 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
