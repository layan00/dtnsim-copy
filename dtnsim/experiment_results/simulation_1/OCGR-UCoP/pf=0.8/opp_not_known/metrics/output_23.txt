The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1357(10 to 6), 1370(1 to 11), 1372(1 to 6), 1373(5 to 10), 1402(4 to 1), 1403(9 to 12), 1421(3 to 9), 1449(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1403: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1357: 1), (1370: 2), (1372: 1), (1373: 4), (1402: 5), (1403: 3), (1421: 2), (1449: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 133 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
