The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
982(10 to 6), 996(1 to 11), 998(1 to 6), 999(5 to 10), 1027(4 to 1), 1028(9 to 12), 1046(3 to 9), 1075(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1028: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(982: 1), (996: 2), (998: 2), (999: 4), (1027: 6), (1028: 3), (1046: 3), (1075: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 160 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
