The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
966(10 to 6), 981(1 to 11), 983(1 to 6), 984(5 to 10), 1011(4 to 1), 1012(9 to 12), 1029(3 to 9), 1060(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1012: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(966: 3), (981: 2), (983: 1), (984: 5), (1011: 5), (1012: 4), (1029: 2), (1060: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 163 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
