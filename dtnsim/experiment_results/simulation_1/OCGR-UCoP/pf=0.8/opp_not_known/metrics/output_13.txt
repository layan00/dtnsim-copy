The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1349(10 to 6), 1364(1 to 11), 1366(1 to 6), 1367(5 to 10), 1395(4 to 1), 1399(9 to 12), 1416(3 to 9), 1446(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1366: 15.000000), (1399: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1349: 1), (1364: 2), (1366: 4), (1367: 4), (1395: 5), (1399: 4), (1416: 3), (1446: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 27 calls to RUCoP, which took 181 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
