The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
586(10 to 6), 599(1 to 11), 600(1 to 6), 601(5 to 10), 628(4 to 1), 629(9 to 12), 645(3 to 9), 673(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(586: 1), (599: 2), (600: 1), (601: 4), (628: 3), (629: 4), (645: 2), (673: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 130 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
