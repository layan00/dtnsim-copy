The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1351(10 to 6), 1364(1 to 11), 1368(1 to 6), 1369(5 to 10), 1396(4 to 1), 1397(9 to 12), 1415(3 to 9), 1445(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1397: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1351: 1), (1364: 2), (1368: 1), (1369: 5), (1396: 5), (1397: 3), (1415: 2), (1445: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
