The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1738(10 to 6), 1754(1 to 11), 1756(1 to 6), 1757(5 to 10), 1784(4 to 1), 1785(9 to 12), 1802(3 to 9), 1830(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1738: 3), (1754: 2), (1756: 1), (1757: 4), (1784: 5), (1785: 4), (1802: 2), (1830: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 166 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
