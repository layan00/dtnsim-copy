The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
591(10 to 6), 604(1 to 11), 607(1 to 6), 608(5 to 10), 636(4 to 1), 637(9 to 12), 657(3 to 9), 682(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(637: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(591: 1), (604: 2), (607: 1), (608: 4), (636: 3), (637: 3), (657: 2), (682: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 604: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
