The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
582(10 to 6), 596(1 to 11), 599(1 to 6), 600(5 to 10), 627(4 to 1), 628(9 to 12), 643(3 to 9), 675(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(582: 1), (596: 2), (599: 1), (600: 5), (627: 3), (628: 4), (643: 2), (675: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
