The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(10 to 6), 213(1 to 11), 214(1 to 6), 215(5 to 10), 242(4 to 1), 243(9 to 12), 259(3 to 9), 286(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 3), (213: 2), (214: 1), (215: 4), (242: 5), (243: 4), (259: 2), (286: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 155 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
