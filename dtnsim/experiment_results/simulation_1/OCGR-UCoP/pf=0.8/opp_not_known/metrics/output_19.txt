The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1717(10 to 6), 1731(1 to 11), 1734(1 to 6), 1735(5 to 10), 1761(4 to 1), 1762(9 to 12), 1778(3 to 9), 1807(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1717: 1), (1731: 2), (1734: 1), (1735: 5), (1761: 5), (1762: 4), (1778: 2), (1807: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 133 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
