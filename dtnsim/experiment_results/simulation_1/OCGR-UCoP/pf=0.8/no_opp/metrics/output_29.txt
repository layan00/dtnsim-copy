The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
371(10 to 6), 374(1 to 11), 377(1 to 6), 378(5 to 10), 380(4 to 1), 381(9 to 12), 384(3 to 9), 388(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(371: 1), (374: 2), (377: 2), (378: 1), (380: 3), (381: 2), (384: 2), (388: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 374: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),

Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 374: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 384: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 380: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 378: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Bundle 380: (to: 12, time: 110.000000),
