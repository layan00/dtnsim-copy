The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
370(10 to 6), 374(1 to 11), 376(1 to 6), 377(5 to 10), 378(4 to 1), 379(9 to 12), 382(3 to 9), 384(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(370: 3), (374: 2), (376: 2), (377: 1), (378: 2), (379: 1), (382: 2), (384: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 374: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
