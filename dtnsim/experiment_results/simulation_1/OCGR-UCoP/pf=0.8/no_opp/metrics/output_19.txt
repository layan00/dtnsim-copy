The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
348(10 to 6), 350(1 to 11), 353(1 to 6), 354(5 to 10), 356(4 to 1), 357(9 to 12), 359(3 to 9), 360(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(348: 1), (350: 2), (353: 2), (354: 2), (356: 2), (357: 1), (359: 2), (360: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 350: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
