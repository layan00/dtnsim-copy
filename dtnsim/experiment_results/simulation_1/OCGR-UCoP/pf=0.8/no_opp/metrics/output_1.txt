The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
147(10 to 6), 149(1 to 11), 152(1 to 6), 153(5 to 10), 155(4 to 1), 156(9 to 12), 160(3 to 9), 162(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(147: 3), (149: 2), (152: 2), (153: 1), (155: 2), (156: 2), (160: 2), (162: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 149: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
