The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
362(10 to 6), 366(1 to 11), 369(1 to 6), 370(5 to 10), 373(4 to 1), 374(9 to 12), 380(3 to 9), 382(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(362: 1), (366: 3), (369: 2), (370: 1), (373: 2), (374: 2), (380: 2), (382: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 366: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 369: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 366: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 380: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4:
