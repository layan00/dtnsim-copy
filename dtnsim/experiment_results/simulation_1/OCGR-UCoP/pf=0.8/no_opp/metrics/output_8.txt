The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
293(10 to 6), 296(1 to 11), 299(1 to 6), 300(5 to 10), 302(4 to 1), 303(9 to 12), 307(3 to 9), 310(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(293: 1), (296: 2), (299: 2), (300: 1), (302: 3), (303: 1), (307: 2), (310: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 296: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 299: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 299: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 307: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 302: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 300: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 303: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 293: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 302: (to: 7, time: 160.000000), 
Node 11: 
Bundle 302: (to: 10, time: 70.000000), 
Node 12: 
Bundle 310: (to: 6, time: 110.000000), 
Node 13:
