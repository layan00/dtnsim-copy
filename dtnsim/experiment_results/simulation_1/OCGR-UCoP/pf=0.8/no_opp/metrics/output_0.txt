The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
61(10 to 6), 63(1 to 11), 68(1 to 6), 69(5 to 10), 71(4 to 1), 72(9 to 12), 78(3 to 9), 83(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(69: 35.000000), (71: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(61: 1), (63: 2), (68: 2), (69: 3), (71: 4), (72: 1), (78: 2), (83: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 66 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 63: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 68: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3:
