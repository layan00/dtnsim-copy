The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
288(10 to 6), 289(1 to 11), 291(1 to 6), 292(5 to 10), 293(4 to 1), 294(9 to 12), 297(3 to 9), 301(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(288: 1), (289: 2), (291: 2), (292: 1), (293: 2), (294: 1), (297: 3), (301: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 289: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 291: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 297: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4:

Node 6: 
Bundle 297: (to: 5, time: 80.000000), (to: 5, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7:
