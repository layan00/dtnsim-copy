The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
363(10 to 6), 365(1 to 11), 366(1 to 6), 367(5 to 10), 369(4 to 1), 370(9 to 12), 372(3 to 9), 376(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(376: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(363: 1), (365: 2), (366: 2), (367: 1), (369: 2), (370: 2), (372: 2), (376: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 365: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 366: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 372: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 369: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 367: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 376: (to: 1, time: 110.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 370: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9:
