The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
60(10 to 6), 62(1 to 11), 66(1 to 6), 67(5 to 10), 69(4 to 1), 70(9 to 12), 72(3 to 9), 74(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(60: 1), (62: 2), (66: 2), (67: 1), (69: 2), (70: 2), (72: 4), (74: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 62: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 66: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 72: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 69: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 67: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Bundle 72: (to: 12, time: 110.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 72: (to: 5, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 70: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9:
