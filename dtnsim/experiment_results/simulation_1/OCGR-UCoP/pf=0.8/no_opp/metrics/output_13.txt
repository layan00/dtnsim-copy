The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
286(10 to 6), 289(1 to 11), 291(1 to 6), 292(5 to 10), 294(4 to 1), 296(9 to 12), 300(3 to 9), 304(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(291: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(286: 1), (289: 2), (291: 3), (292: 1), (294: 2), (296: 1), (300: 3), (304: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 289: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 291: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 289: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 291: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 300: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 294: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 292: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 300: (to: 5, time: 80.000000), (to: 5, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7:
