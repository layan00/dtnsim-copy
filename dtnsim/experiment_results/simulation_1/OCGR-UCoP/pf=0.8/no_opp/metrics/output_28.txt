The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
287(10 to 6), 288(1 to 11), 292(1 to 6), 293(5 to 10), 296(4 to 1), 297(9 to 12), 300(3 to 9), 304(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(287: 1), (288: 2), (292: 2), (293: 2), (296: 5), (297: 1), (300: 2), (304: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 288: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
