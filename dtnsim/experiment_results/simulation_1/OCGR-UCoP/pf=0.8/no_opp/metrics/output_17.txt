The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(10 to 6), 204(1 to 11), 207(1 to 6), 208(5 to 10), 210(4 to 1), 211(9 to 12), 214(3 to 9), 216(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 1), (204: 2), (207: 2), (208: 1), (210: 2), (211: 1), (214: 2), (216: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 204: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 207: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 204: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 214: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 210: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 208: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 211: (to: 8, time: 50.000000),
