The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
275(10 to 6), 277(1 to 11), 280(1 to 6), 281(5 to 10), 283(4 to 1), 284(9 to 12), 289(3 to 9), 291(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(275: 1), (277: 2), (280: 2), (281: 1), (283: 3), (284: 1), (289: 4), (291: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 277: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
