The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(10 to 6), 217(1 to 11), 218(1 to 6), 219(5 to 10), 222(4 to 1), 225(9 to 12), 228(3 to 9), 230(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 1), (217: 3), (218: 4), (219: 1), (222: 3), (225: 1), (228: 4), (230: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 217: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
