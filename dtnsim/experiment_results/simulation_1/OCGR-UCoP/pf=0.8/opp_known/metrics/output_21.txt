The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
461(10 to 6), 462(1 to 11), 465(1 to 6), 466(5 to 10), 482(4 to 1), 485(9 to 12), 492(3 to 9), 507(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(485: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(461: 1), (462: 2), (465: 2), (466: 3), (482: 2), (485: 3), (492: 4), (507: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 462: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
