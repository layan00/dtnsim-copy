The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
723(10 to 6), 725(1 to 11), 726(1 to 6), 727(5 to 10), 744(4 to 1), 751(9 to 12), 755(3 to 9), 774(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(726: 15.000000), (755: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(723: 1), (725: 4), (726: 4), (727: 3), (744: 2), (751: 4), (755: 5), (774: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
