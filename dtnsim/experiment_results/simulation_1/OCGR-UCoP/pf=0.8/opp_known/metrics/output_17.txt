The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
710(10 to 6), 712(1 to 11), 715(1 to 6), 716(5 to 10), 732(4 to 1), 735(9 to 12), 740(3 to 9), 756(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(710: 1), (712: 3), (715: 2), (716: 3), (732: 2), (735: 4), (740: 4), (756: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
