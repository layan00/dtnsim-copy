The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1240(10 to 6), 1244(1 to 11), 1247(1 to 6), 1248(5 to 10), 1265(4 to 1), 1268(9 to 12), 1275(3 to 9), 1293(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1244: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1240: 1), (1244: 5), (1247: 2), (1248: 3), (1265: 2), (1268: 4), (1275: 4), (1293: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
