The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
452(10 to 6), 453(1 to 11), 454(1 to 6), 455(5 to 10), 470(4 to 1), 473(9 to 12), 477(3 to 9), 497(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(477: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(452: 1), (453: 2), (454: 2), (455: 3), (470: 2), (473: 4), (477: 5), (497: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
