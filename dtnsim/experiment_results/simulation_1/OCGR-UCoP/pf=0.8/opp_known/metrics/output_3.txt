The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
979(10 to 6), 980(1 to 11), 982(1 to 6), 983(5 to 10), 998(4 to 1), 1001(9 to 12), 1006(3 to 9), 1023(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(979: 1), (980: 2), (982: 2), (983: 3), (998: 2), (1001: 4), (1006: 4), (1023: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
