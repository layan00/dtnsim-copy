The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
462(10 to 6), 464(1 to 11), 467(1 to 6), 468(5 to 10), 484(4 to 1), 487(9 to 12), 492(3 to 9), 508(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(462: 3), (464: 2), (467: 2), (468: 3), (484: 2), (487: 4), (492: 4), (508: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
