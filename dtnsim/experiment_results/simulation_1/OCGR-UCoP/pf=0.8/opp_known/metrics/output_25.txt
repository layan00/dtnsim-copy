The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
186(10 to 6), 189(1 to 11), 190(1 to 6), 191(5 to 10), 206(4 to 1), 209(9 to 12), 213(3 to 9), 228(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 3), (189: 2), (190: 2), (191: 3), (206: 2), (209: 4), (213: 4), (228: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
