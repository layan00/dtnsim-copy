The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1251(10 to 6), 1253(1 to 11), 1254(1 to 6), 1255(5 to 10), 1272(4 to 1), 1275(9 to 12), 1279(3 to 9), 1296(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1275: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1251: 1), (1253: 2), (1254: 2), (1255: 3), (1272: 2), (1275: 3), (1279: 4), (1296: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1253: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
