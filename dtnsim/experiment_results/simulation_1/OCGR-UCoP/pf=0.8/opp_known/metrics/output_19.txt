The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1231(10 to 6), 1233(1 to 11), 1236(1 to 6), 1237(5 to 10), 1253(4 to 1), 1256(9 to 12), 1260(3 to 9), 1275(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1231: 1), (1233: 2), (1236: 2), (1237: 5), (1253: 2), (1256: 4), (1260: 4), (1275: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
