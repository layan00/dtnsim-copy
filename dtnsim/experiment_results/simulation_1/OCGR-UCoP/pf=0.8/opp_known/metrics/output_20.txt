The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
193(10 to 6), 197(1 to 11), 201(1 to 6), 202(5 to 10), 220(4 to 1), 223(9 to 12), 229(3 to 9), 245(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(193: 1), (197: 3), (201: 2), (202: 3), (220: 2), (223: 4), (229: 4), (245: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
