The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
722(10 to 6), 724(1 to 11), 726(1 to 6), 727(5 to 10), 742(4 to 1), 745(9 to 12), 749(3 to 9), 765(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(722: 1), (724: 3), (726: 2), (727: 3), (742: 2), (745: 4), (749: 4), (765: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
