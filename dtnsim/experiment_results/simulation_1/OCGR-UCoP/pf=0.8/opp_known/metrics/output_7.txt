The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
725(10 to 6), 727(1 to 11), 729(1 to 6), 730(5 to 10), 746(4 to 1), 749(9 to 12), 755(3 to 9), 771(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(749: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(725: 1), (727: 3), (729: 2), (730: 3), (746: 2), (749: 3), (755: 4), (771: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
