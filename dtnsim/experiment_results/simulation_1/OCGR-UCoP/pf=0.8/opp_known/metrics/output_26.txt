The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
442(10 to 6), 444(1 to 11), 445(1 to 6), 446(5 to 10), 461(4 to 1), 464(9 to 12), 469(3 to 9), 487(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(442: 4), (444: 2), (445: 2), (446: 3), (461: 2), (464: 4), (469: 4), (487: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
