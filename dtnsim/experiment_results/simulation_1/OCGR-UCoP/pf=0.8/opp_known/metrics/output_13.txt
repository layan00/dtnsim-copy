The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
987(10 to 6), 990(1 to 11), 992(1 to 6), 993(5 to 10), 1009(4 to 1), 1015(9 to 12), 1020(3 to 9), 1037(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(992: 15.000000), (1015: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(987: 1), (990: 3), (992: 4), (993: 3), (1009: 2), (1015: 4), (1020: 4), (1037: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
