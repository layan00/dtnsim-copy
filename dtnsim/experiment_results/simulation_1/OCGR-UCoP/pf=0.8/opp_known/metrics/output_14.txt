The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1253(10 to 6), 1255(1 to 11), 1256(1 to 6), 1257(5 to 10), 1273(4 to 1), 1276(9 to 12), 1279(3 to 9), 1297(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1297: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1253: 1), (1255: 2), (1256: 2), (1257: 3), (1273: 2), (1276: 4), (1279: 4), (1297: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
