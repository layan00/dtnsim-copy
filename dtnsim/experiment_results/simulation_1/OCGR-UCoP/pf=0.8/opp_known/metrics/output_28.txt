The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
984(10 to 6), 985(1 to 11), 989(1 to 6), 990(5 to 10), 1007(4 to 1), 1010(9 to 12), 1016(3 to 9), 1036(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1010: 0.000000), (1016: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(984: 1), (985: 2), (989: 2), (990: 5), (1007: 2), (1010: 3), (1016: 5), (1036: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
