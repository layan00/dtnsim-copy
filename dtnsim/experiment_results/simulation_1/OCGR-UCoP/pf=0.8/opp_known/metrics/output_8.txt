The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
988(10 to 6), 991(1 to 11), 994(1 to 6), 995(5 to 10), 1011(4 to 1), 1014(9 to 12), 1019(3 to 9), 1035(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(988: 1), (991: 2), (994: 2), (995: 3), (1011: 2), (1014: 4), (1019: 4), (1035: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
