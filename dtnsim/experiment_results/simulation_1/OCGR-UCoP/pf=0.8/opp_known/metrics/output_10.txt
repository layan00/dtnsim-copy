The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
188(10 to 6), 190(1 to 11), 193(1 to 6), 194(5 to 10), 210(4 to 1), 213(9 to 12), 217(3 to 9), 232(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(188: 1), (190: 2), (193: 2), (194: 3), (210: 2), (213: 3), (217: 4), (232: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 190: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 193: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 217: (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 4:

Bundle 213: (to: 12, time: 50.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 217: (to: 5, time: 80.000000), (to: 5, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7:
