The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
722(10 to 6), 725(1 to 11), 727(1 to 6), 728(5 to 10), 745(4 to 1), 748(9 to 12), 753(3 to 9), 770(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(748: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(722: 3), (725: 2), (727: 2), (728: 5), (745: 2), (748: 4), (753: 4), (770: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
