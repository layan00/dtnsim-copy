The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
992(10 to 6), 993(1 to 11), 995(1 to 6), 996(5 to 10), 1014(4 to 1), 1017(9 to 12), 1023(3 to 9), 1039(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1017: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(992: 1), (993: 2), (995: 2), (996: 3), (1014: 2), (1017: 3), (1023: 4), (1039: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 993: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
