The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
193(10 to 6), 195(1 to 11), 200(1 to 6), 201(5 to 10), 217(4 to 1), 220(9 to 12), 226(3 to 9), 244(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(193: 1), (195: 3), (200: 2), (201: 4), (217: 2), (220: 4), (226: 4), (244: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 68 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
