The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
707(10 to 6), 709(1 to 11), 711(1 to 6), 712(5 to 10), 730(4 to 1), 734(9 to 12), 742(3 to 9), 762(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(709: 55.000000), (711: 25.000000), (734: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(707: 1), (709: 6), (711: 2), (712: 3), (730: 2), (734: 3), (742: 4), (762: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
