The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
451(10 to 6), 453(1 to 11), 456(1 to 6), 457(5 to 10), 474(4 to 1), 477(9 to 12), 480(3 to 9), 503(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(457: 35.000000), (480: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(451: 1), (453: 2), (456: 2), (457: 4), (474: 2), (477: 4), (480: 5), (503: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
