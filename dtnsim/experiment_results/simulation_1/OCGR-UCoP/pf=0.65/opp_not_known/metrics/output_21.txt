The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
617(10 to 6), 631(1 to 11), 635(1 to 6), 636(5 to 10), 665(4 to 1), 667(9 to 12), 689(3 to 9), 717(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(636: 55.000000), (667: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(617: 1), (631: 2), (635: 1), (636: 8), (665: 5), (667: 3), (689: 3), (717: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 91 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
