The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
604(10 to 6), 620(1 to 11), 622(1 to 6), 623(5 to 10), 652(4 to 1), 654(9 to 12), 673(3 to 9), 704(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(623: 55.000000), (654: 0.000000), (673: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(604: 3), (620: 2), (622: 1), (623: 9), (652: 5), (654: 3), (673: 6), (704: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
