The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(10 to 6), 218(1 to 11), 220(1 to 6), 221(5 to 10), 249(4 to 1), 251(9 to 12), 269(3 to 9), 296(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 3), (218: 2), (220: 1), (221: 5), (249: 4), (251: 4), (269: 2), (296: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 137 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
