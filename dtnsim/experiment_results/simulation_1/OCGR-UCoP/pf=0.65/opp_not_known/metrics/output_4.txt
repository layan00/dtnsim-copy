The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1776(10 to 6), 1792(1 to 11), 1795(1 to 6), 1796(5 to 10), 1826(4 to 1), 1831(9 to 12), 1851(3 to 9), 1882(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1792: 55.000000), (1795: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1776: 1), (1792: 5), (1795: 4), (1796: 5), (1826: 2), (1831: 4), (1851: 3), (1882: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 143 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
