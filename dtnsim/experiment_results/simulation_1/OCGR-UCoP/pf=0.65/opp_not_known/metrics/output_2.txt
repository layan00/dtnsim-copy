The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
998(10 to 6), 1012(1 to 11), 1014(1 to 6), 1015(5 to 10), 1042(4 to 1), 1043(9 to 12), 1060(3 to 9), 1088(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1042: 140.000000), (1043: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(998: 1), (1012: 2), (1014: 2), (1015: 4), (1042: 6), (1043: 4), (1060: 2), (1088: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
