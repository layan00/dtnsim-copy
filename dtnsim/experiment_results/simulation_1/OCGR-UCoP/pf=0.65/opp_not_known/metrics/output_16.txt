The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
602(10 to 6), 615(1 to 11), 617(1 to 6), 618(5 to 10), 646(4 to 1), 647(9 to 12), 664(3 to 9), 693(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(664: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(602: 1), (615: 2), (617: 1), (618: 4), (646: 2), (647: 4), (664: 6), (693: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
