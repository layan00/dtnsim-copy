The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(10 to 6), 218(1 to 11), 222(1 to 6), 223(5 to 10), 252(4 to 1), 257(9 to 12), 277(3 to 9), 307(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 55.000000), (222: 15.000000), (257: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 1), (218: 6), (222: 3), (223: 4), (252: 4), (257: 3), (277: 2), (307: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 127 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
