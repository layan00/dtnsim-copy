The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1019(10 to 6), 1033(1 to 11), 1036(1 to 6), 1037(5 to 10), 1067(4 to 1), 1073(9 to 12), 1090(3 to 9), 1120(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1036: 15.000000), (1090: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1019: 1), (1033: 3), (1036: 3), (1037: 5), (1067: 6), (1073: 4), (1090: 6), (1120: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 115 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
