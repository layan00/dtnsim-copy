The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(10 to 6), 224(1 to 11), 228(1 to 6), 229(5 to 10), 258(4 to 1), 263(9 to 12), 280(3 to 9), 309(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(228: 15.000000), (263: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 1), (224: 3), (228: 3), (229: 4), (258: 5), (263: 3), (280: 2), (309: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
