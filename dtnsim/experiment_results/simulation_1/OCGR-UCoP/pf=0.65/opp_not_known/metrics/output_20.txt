The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(10 to 6), 230(1 to 11), 236(1 to 6), 237(5 to 10), 268(4 to 1), 269(9 to 12), 290(3 to 9), 319(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 25.000000), (269: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 1), (230: 2), (236: 2), (237: 4), (268: 4), (269: 3), (290: 2), (319: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 165 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
