The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
591(10 to 6), 606(1 to 11), 609(1 to 6), 610(5 to 10), 638(4 to 1), 643(9 to 12), 661(3 to 9), 692(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(609: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(591: 4), (606: 3), (609: 3), (610: 4), (638: 2), (643: 4), (661: 3), (692: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 173 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
