The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1794(10 to 6), 1808(1 to 11), 1810(1 to 6), 1811(5 to 10), 1840(4 to 1), 1841(9 to 12), 1859(3 to 9), 1888(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1841: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1794: 1), (1808: 2), (1810: 1), (1811: 4), (1840: 4), (1841: 3), (1859: 2), (1888: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 129 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
