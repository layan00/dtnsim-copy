The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1424(10 to 6), 1440(1 to 11), 1444(1 to 6), 1445(5 to 10), 1476(4 to 1), 1478(9 to 12), 1497(3 to 9), 1528(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1478: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1424: 1), (1440: 2), (1444: 2), (1445: 9), (1476: 4), (1478: 3), (1497: 2), (1528: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 156 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
