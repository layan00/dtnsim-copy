The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1381(10 to 6), 1396(1 to 11), 1399(1 to 6), 1400(5 to 10), 1429(4 to 1), 1430(9 to 12), 1451(3 to 9), 1481(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1430: 0.000000), (1451: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1381: 1), (1396: 2), (1399: 1), (1400: 4), (1429: 4), (1430: 3), (1451: 6), (1481: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
