The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1385(10 to 6), 1399(1 to 11), 1403(1 to 6), 1404(5 to 10), 1431(4 to 1), 1432(9 to 12), 1449(3 to 9), 1479(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1449: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1385: 1), (1399: 2), (1403: 1), (1404: 4), (1431: 4), (1432: 4), (1449: 6), (1479: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 123 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
