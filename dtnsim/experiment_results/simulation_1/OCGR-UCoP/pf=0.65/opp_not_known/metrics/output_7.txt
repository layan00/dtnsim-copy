The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1007(10 to 6), 1021(1 to 11), 1025(1 to 6), 1026(5 to 10), 1056(4 to 1), 1057(9 to 12), 1075(3 to 9), 1104(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1056: 140.000000), (1057: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1007: 1), (1021: 2), (1025: 2), (1026: 4), (1056: 6), (1057: 3), (1075: 3), (1104: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 142 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
