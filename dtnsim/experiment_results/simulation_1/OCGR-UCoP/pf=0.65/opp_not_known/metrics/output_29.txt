The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1797(10 to 6), 1812(1 to 11), 1816(1 to 6), 1817(5 to 10), 1846(4 to 1), 1850(9 to 12), 1873(3 to 9), 1903(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1812: 35.000000), (1816: 15.000000), (1817: 35.000000), (1850: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1797: 1), (1812: 3), (1816: 4), (1817: 3), (1846: 2), (1850: 3), (1873: 2), (1903: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 78 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
