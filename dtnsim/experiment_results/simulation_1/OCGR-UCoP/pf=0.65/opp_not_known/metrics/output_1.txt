The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
607(10 to 6), 621(1 to 11), 625(1 to 6), 626(5 to 10), 655(4 to 1), 657(9 to 12), 677(3 to 9), 708(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(657: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(607: 4), (621: 2), (625: 1), (626: 9), (655: 2), (657: 3), (677: 2), (708: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 135 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
