The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1774(10 to 6), 1789(1 to 11), 1794(1 to 6), 1795(5 to 10), 1822(4 to 1), 1823(9 to 12), 1842(3 to 9), 1873(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1789: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1774: 1), (1789: 5), (1794: 2), (1795: 5), (1822: 4), (1823: 4), (1842: 3), (1873: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 156 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
