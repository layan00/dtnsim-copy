The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
991(10 to 6), 1006(1 to 11), 1009(1 to 6), 1010(5 to 10), 1040(4 to 1), 1042(9 to 12), 1065(3 to 9), 1097(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1006: 35.000000), (1009: 25.000000), (1010: 35.000000), (1042: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(991: 1), (1006: 4), (1009: 2), (1010: 3), (1040: 4), (1042: 3), (1065: 2), (1097: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 107 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
