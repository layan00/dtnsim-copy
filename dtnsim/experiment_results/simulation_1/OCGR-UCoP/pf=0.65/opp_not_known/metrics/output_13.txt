The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1418(10 to 6), 1435(1 to 11), 1438(1 to 6), 1439(5 to 10), 1467(4 to 1), 1471(9 to 12), 1489(3 to 9), 1523(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1438: 15.000000), (1471: 55.000000), (1489: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1418: 1), (1435: 2), (1438: 4), (1439: 4), (1467: 4), (1471: 4), (1489: 4), (1523: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 136 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
