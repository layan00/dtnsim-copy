The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1018(10 to 6), 1033(1 to 11), 1037(1 to 6), 1038(5 to 10), 1065(4 to 1), 1066(9 to 12), 1084(3 to 9), 1116(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1038: 55.000000), (1066: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1018: 3), (1033: 2), (1037: 1), (1038: 5), (1065: 5), (1066: 4), (1084: 2), (1116: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 121 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
