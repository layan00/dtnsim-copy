The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1823(10 to 6), 1837(1 to 11), 1840(1 to 6), 1841(5 to 10), 1870(4 to 1), 1872(9 to 12), 1890(3 to 9), 1920(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1840: 25.000000), (1920: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1823: 1), (1837: 2), (1840: 2), (1841: 5), (1870: 6), (1872: 4), (1890: 2), (1920: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 108 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
