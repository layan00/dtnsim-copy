The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(10 to 6), 222(1 to 11), 228(1 to 6), 229(5 to 10), 256(4 to 1), 257(9 to 12), 277(3 to 9), 307(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(228: 25.000000), (229: 35.000000), (256: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 1), (222: 2), (228: 2), (229: 3), (256: 6), (257: 4), (277: 2), (307: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 134 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
