The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
991(10 to 6), 1005(1 to 11), 1008(1 to 6), 1009(5 to 10), 1037(4 to 1), 1038(9 to 12), 1057(3 to 9), 1087(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(991: 1), (1005: 2), (1008: 2), (1009: 4), (1037: 4), (1038: 4), (1057: 3), (1087: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 184 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
