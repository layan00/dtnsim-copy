The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1394(10 to 6), 1408(1 to 11), 1412(1 to 6), 1413(5 to 10), 1440(4 to 1), 1441(9 to 12), 1460(3 to 9), 1494(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1441: 0.000000), (1460: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1394: 1), (1408: 2), (1412: 1), (1413: 5), (1440: 4), (1441: 3), (1460: 4), (1494: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
