The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
324(10 to 6), 326(1 to 11), 330(1 to 6), 331(5 to 10), 333(4 to 1), 334(9 to 12), 338(3 to 9), 342(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(330: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(324: 1), (326: 2), (330: 2), (331: 1), (333: 2), (334: 1), (338: 4), (342: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 326: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 330: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 330: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 338: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 333: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5:
