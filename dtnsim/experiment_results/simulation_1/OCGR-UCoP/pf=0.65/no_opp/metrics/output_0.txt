The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
64(10 to 6), 66(1 to 11), 72(1 to 6), 73(5 to 10), 76(4 to 1), 77(9 to 12), 84(3 to 9), 89(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(72: 25.000000), (73: 35.000000), (76: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(64: 1), (66: 2), (72: 2), (73: 3), (76: 4), (77: 1), (84: 2), (89: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 67 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 66: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 72: (to: 2, time: 30.000000),
