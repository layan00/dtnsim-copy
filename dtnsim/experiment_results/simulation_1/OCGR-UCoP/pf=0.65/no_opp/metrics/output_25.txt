The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
59(10 to 6), 62(1 to 11), 64(1 to 6), 65(5 to 10), 67(4 to 1), 68(9 to 12), 74(3 to 9), 75(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(59: 3), (62: 2), (64: 2), (65: 1), (67: 3), (68: 2), (74: 2), (75: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 62: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 64: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 74: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 59: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 67: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 65: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8:
