The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
404(10 to 6), 407(1 to 11), 412(1 to 6), 413(5 to 10), 416(4 to 1), 417(9 to 12), 422(3 to 9), 423(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(404: 1), (407: 3), (412: 2), (413: 2), (416: 2), (417: 1), (422: 3), (423: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 407: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
