The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
240(10 to 6), 242(1 to 11), 246(1 to 6), 247(5 to 10), 251(4 to 1), 252(9 to 12), 255(3 to 9), 258(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(240: 1), (242: 2), (246: 2), (247: 1), (251: 2), (252: 1), (255: 3), (258: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 242: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 246: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 246: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3:
