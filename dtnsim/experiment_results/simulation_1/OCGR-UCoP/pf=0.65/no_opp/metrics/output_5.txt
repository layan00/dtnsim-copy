The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
61(10 to 6), 62(1 to 11), 66(1 to 6), 67(5 to 10), 71(4 to 1), 73(9 to 12), 79(3 to 9), 81(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(66: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(61: 1), (62: 4), (66: 2), (67: 1), (71: 2), (73: 1), (79: 2), (81: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 62: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 66: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 66: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 62: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 79: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 62: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 71: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 67: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 73: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 61: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 81: (to: 6, time: 110.000000), 
Node 13:
