The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(10 to 6), 74(1 to 11), 80(1 to 6), 81(5 to 10), 88(4 to 1), 89(9 to 12), 97(3 to 9), 100(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 1), (74: 2), (80: 2), (81: 4), (88: 3), (89: 2), (97: 2), (100: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 74: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
