The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
409(10 to 6), 413(1 to 11), 416(1 to 6), 417(5 to 10), 421(4 to 1), 423(9 to 12), 431(3 to 9), 436(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(416: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(409: 1), (413: 3), (416: 3), (417: 1), (421: 3), (423: 2), (431: 3), (436: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 413: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
