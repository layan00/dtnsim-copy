The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(10 to 6), 249(1 to 11), 251(1 to 6), 252(5 to 10), 253(4 to 1), 254(9 to 12), 257(3 to 9), 259(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 1), (249: 2), (251: 2), (252: 1), (253: 2), (254: 1), (257: 2), (259: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 249: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 251: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 249: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 257: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 253: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 252: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7:
