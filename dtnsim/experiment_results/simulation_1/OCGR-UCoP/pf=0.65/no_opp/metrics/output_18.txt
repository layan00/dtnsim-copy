The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
319(10 to 6), 322(1 to 11), 325(1 to 6), 326(5 to 10), 329(4 to 1), 330(9 to 12), 337(3 to 9), 341(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(319: 1), (322: 2), (325: 2), (326: 1), (329: 3), (330: 1), (337: 4), (341: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 322: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
