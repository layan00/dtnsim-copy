The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
64(10 to 6), 67(1 to 11), 71(1 to 6), 72(5 to 10), 75(4 to 1), 76(9 to 12), 78(3 to 9), 83(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(64: 1), (67: 2), (71: 2), (72: 1), (75: 3), (76: 2), (78: 4), (83: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 67: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
