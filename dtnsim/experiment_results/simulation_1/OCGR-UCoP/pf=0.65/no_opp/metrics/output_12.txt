The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
258(10 to 6), 261(1 to 11), 265(1 to 6), 266(5 to 10), 270(4 to 1), 271(9 to 12), 276(3 to 9), 280(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(265: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(258: 3), (261: 2), (265: 2), (266: 2), (270: 2), (271: 1), (276: 2), (280: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 261: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 265: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 265: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 276: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 258: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 266: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 270: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 266: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 271: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10:
