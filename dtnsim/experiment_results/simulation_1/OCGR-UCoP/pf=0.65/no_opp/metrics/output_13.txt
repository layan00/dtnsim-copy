The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
351(10 to 6), 356(1 to 11), 359(1 to 6), 360(5 to 10), 362(4 to 1), 364(9 to 12), 369(3 to 9), 377(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(359: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(351: 1), (356: 2), (359: 3), (360: 1), (362: 5), (364: 1), (369: 4), (377: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
