The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
341(10 to 6), 343(1 to 11), 347(1 to 6), 348(5 to 10), 351(4 to 1), 352(9 to 12), 356(3 to 9), 362(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(356: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(341: 1), (343: 2), (347: 2), (348: 2), (351: 5), (352: 1), (356: 4), (362: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
