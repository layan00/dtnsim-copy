The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
327(10 to 6), 330(1 to 11), 333(1 to 6), 334(5 to 10), 337(4 to 1), 338(9 to 12), 342(3 to 9), 346(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(327: 1), (330: 2), (333: 2), (334: 1), (337: 3), (338: 1), (342: 2), (346: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 330: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 333: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 333: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 342: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 337: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 334: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 338: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10:
