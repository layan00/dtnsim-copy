The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
170(10 to 6), 172(1 to 11), 176(1 to 6), 177(5 to 10), 180(4 to 1), 181(9 to 12), 189(3 to 9), 191(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(170: 1), (172: 2), (176: 2), (177: 1), (180: 4), (181: 3), (189: 3), (191: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 172: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
