The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
412(10 to 6), 414(1 to 11), 416(1 to 6), 417(5 to 10), 420(4 to 1), 421(9 to 12), 425(3 to 9), 429(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(412: 1), (414: 2), (416: 2), (417: 1), (420: 4), (421: 1), (425: 2), (429: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 414: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
