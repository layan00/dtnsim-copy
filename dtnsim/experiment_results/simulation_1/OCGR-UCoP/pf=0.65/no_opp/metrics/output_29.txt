The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
439(10 to 6), 442(1 to 11), 446(1 to 6), 447(5 to 10), 452(4 to 1), 454(9 to 12), 464(3 to 9), 470(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(442: 35.000000), (447: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(439: 1), (442: 3), (446: 4), (447: 3), (452: 3), (454: 2), (464: 2), (470: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 442: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
