The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
150(10 to 6), 154(1 to 11), 156(1 to 6), 157(5 to 10), 160(4 to 1), 161(9 to 12), 166(3 to 9), 169(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(150: 3), (154: 2), (156: 2), (157: 1), (160: 2), (161: 3), (166: 4), (169: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 154: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
