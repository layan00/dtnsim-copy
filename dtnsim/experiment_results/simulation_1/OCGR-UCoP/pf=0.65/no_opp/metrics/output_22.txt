The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
264(10 to 6), 266(1 to 11), 269(1 to 6), 270(5 to 10), 274(4 to 1), 277(9 to 12), 282(3 to 9), 286(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(269: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(264: 1), (266: 3), (269: 4), (270: 1), (274: 5), (277: 2), (282: 4), (286: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 266: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
