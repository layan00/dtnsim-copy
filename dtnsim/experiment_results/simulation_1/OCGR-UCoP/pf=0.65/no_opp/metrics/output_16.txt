The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
152(10 to 6), 153(1 to 11), 155(1 to 6), 156(5 to 10), 158(4 to 1), 159(9 to 12), 162(3 to 9), 167(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(152: 1), (153: 2), (155: 2), (156: 1), (158: 3), (159: 1), (162: 4), (167: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 153: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
