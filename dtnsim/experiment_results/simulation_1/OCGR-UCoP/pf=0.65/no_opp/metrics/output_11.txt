The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
159(10 to 6), 162(1 to 11), 166(1 to 6), 167(5 to 10), 171(4 to 1), 174(9 to 12), 176(3 to 9), 183(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(183: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(159: 4), (162: 3), (166: 4), (167: 2), (171: 3), (174: 1), (176: 2), (183: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 162: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
