The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
361(10 to 6), 365(1 to 11), 369(1 to 6), 370(5 to 10), 375(4 to 1), 376(9 to 12), 381(3 to 9), 384(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(361: 1), (365: 2), (369: 2), (370: 1), (375: 2), (376: 3), (381: 2), (384: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 365: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
