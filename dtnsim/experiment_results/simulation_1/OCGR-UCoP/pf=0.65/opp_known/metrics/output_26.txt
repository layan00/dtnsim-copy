The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
461(10 to 6), 464(1 to 11), 467(1 to 6), 468(5 to 10), 486(4 to 1), 491(9 to 12), 496(3 to 9), 515(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(467: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(461: 4), (464: 4), (467: 3), (468: 5), (486: 2), (491: 4), (496: 3), (515: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
