The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
776(10 to 6), 779(1 to 11), 783(1 to 6), 784(5 to 10), 801(4 to 1), 802(9 to 12), 808(3 to 9), 829(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(784: 35.000000), (802: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(776: 3), (779: 2), (783: 1), (784: 4), (801: 5), (802: 4), (808: 5), (829: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
