The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(10 to 6), 199(1 to 11), 203(1 to 6), 204(5 to 10), 221(4 to 1), 222(9 to 12), 225(3 to 9), 244(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 1), (199: 2), (203: 1), (204: 3), (221: 2), (222: 4), (225: 5), (244: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
