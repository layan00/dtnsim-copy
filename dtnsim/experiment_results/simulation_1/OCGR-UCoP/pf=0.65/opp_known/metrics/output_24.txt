The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1333(10 to 6), 1338(1 to 11), 1341(1 to 6), 1342(5 to 10), 1358(4 to 1), 1359(9 to 12), 1364(3 to 9), 1384(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1359: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1333: 3), (1338: 2), (1341: 1), (1342: 3), (1358: 4), (1359: 4), (1364: 5), (1384: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
