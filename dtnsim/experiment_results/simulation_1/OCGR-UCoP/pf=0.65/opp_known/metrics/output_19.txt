The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1279(10 to 6), 1282(1 to 11), 1287(1 to 6), 1288(5 to 10), 1304(4 to 1), 1305(9 to 12), 1312(3 to 9), 1331(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1282: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1279: 1), (1282: 5), (1287: 1), (1288: 5), (1304: 4), (1305: 4), (1312: 5), (1331: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
