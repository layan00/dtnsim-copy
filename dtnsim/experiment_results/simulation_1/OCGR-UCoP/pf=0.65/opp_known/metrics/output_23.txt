The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1055(10 to 6), 1059(1 to 11), 1063(1 to 6), 1064(5 to 10), 1082(4 to 1), 1083(9 to 12), 1089(3 to 9), 1108(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1083: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1055: 1), (1059: 3), (1063: 1), (1064: 3), (1082: 4), (1083: 3), (1089: 5), (1108: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
