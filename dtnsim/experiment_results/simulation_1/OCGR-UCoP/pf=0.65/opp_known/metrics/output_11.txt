The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
484(10 to 6), 487(1 to 11), 491(1 to 6), 492(5 to 10), 510(4 to 1), 515(9 to 12), 519(3 to 9), 544(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(491: 15.000000), (492: 35.000000), (519: 15.000000), (544: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(484: 4), (487: 4), (491: 3), (492: 4), (510: 2), (515: 4), (519: 6), (544: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
