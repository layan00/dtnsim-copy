The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
468(10 to 6), 469(1 to 11), 471(1 to 6), 472(5 to 10), 488(4 to 1), 489(9 to 12), 494(3 to 9), 516(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(494: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(468: 1), (469: 2), (471: 1), (472: 3), (488: 2), (489: 4), (494: 6), (516: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
