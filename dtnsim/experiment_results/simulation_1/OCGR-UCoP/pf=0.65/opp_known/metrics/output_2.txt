The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
746(10 to 6), 748(1 to 11), 750(1 to 6), 751(5 to 10), 766(4 to 1), 767(9 to 12), 772(3 to 9), 790(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(766: 140.000000), (767: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(746: 1), (748: 3), (750: 1), (751: 3), (766: 6), (767: 4), (772: 5), (790: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
