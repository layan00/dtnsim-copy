The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1008(10 to 6), 1011(1 to 11), 1014(1 to 6), 1015(5 to 10), 1032(4 to 1), 1033(9 to 12), 1042(3 to 9), 1060(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1033: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1008: 1), (1011: 2), (1014: 1), (1015: 3), (1032: 4), (1033: 3), (1042: 3), (1060: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1011: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
