The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
738(10 to 6), 740(1 to 11), 743(1 to 6), 744(5 to 10), 760(4 to 1), 761(9 to 12), 768(3 to 9), 786(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(738: 1), (740: 3), (743: 1), (744: 3), (760: 4), (761: 4), (768: 3), (786: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
