The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
752(10 to 6), 754(1 to 11), 758(1 to 6), 759(5 to 10), 776(4 to 1), 780(9 to 12), 786(3 to 9), 803(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(758: 15.000000), (776: 140.000000), (780: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(752: 1), (754: 3), (758: 3), (759: 3), (776: 6), (780: 3), (786: 3), (803: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
