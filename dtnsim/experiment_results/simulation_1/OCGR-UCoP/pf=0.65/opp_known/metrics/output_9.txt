The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1303(10 to 6), 1305(1 to 11), 1307(1 to 6), 1308(5 to 10), 1325(4 to 1), 1326(9 to 12), 1332(3 to 9), 1351(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1326: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1303: 1), (1305: 2), (1307: 1), (1308: 3), (1325: 4), (1326: 3), (1332: 5), (1351: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
