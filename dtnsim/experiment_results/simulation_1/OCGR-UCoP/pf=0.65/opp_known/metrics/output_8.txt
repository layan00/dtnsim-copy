The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1031(10 to 6), 1034(1 to 11), 1037(1 to 6), 1038(5 to 10), 1054(4 to 1), 1055(9 to 12), 1060(3 to 9), 1079(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1055: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1031: 1), (1034: 2), (1037: 1), (1038: 3), (1054: 4), (1055: 4), (1060: 5), (1079: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
