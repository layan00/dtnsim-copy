The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1316(10 to 6), 1319(1 to 11), 1323(1 to 6), 1324(5 to 10), 1343(4 to 1), 1347(9 to 12), 1357(3 to 9), 1380(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1319: 35.000000), (1323: 15.000000), (1324: 35.000000), (1347: 0.000000), (1357: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1316: 1), (1319: 3), (1323: 3), (1324: 4), (1343: 2), (1347: 3), (1357: 6), (1380: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
