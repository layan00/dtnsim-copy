The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(10 to 6), 206(1 to 11), 212(1 to 6), 213(5 to 10), 233(4 to 1), 237(9 to 12), 244(3 to 9), 263(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 15.000000), (237: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 1), (206: 3), (212: 3), (213: 5), (233: 4), (237: 3), (244: 5), (263: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
