The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1033(10 to 6), 1035(1 to 11), 1039(1 to 6), 1040(5 to 10), 1057(4 to 1), 1058(9 to 12), 1065(3 to 9), 1085(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1058: 0.000000), (1065: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1033: 1), (1035: 2), (1039: 1), (1040: 5), (1057: 4), (1058: 3), (1065: 4), (1085: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
