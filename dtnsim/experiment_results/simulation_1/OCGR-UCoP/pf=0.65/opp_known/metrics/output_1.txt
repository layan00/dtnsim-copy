The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
476(10 to 6), 478(1 to 11), 482(1 to 6), 483(5 to 10), 500(4 to 1), 501(9 to 12), 508(3 to 9), 527(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(501: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(476: 4), (478: 2), (482: 1), (483: 3), (500: 2), (501: 3), (508: 5), (527: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
