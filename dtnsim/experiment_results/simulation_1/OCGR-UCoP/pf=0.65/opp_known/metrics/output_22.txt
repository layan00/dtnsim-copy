The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
770(10 to 6), 772(1 to 11), 775(1 to 6), 776(5 to 10), 794(4 to 1), 799(9 to 12), 804(3 to 9), 827(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(775: 15.000000), (804: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(770: 1), (772: 4), (775: 3), (776: 3), (794: 6), (799: 4), (804: 6), (827: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
