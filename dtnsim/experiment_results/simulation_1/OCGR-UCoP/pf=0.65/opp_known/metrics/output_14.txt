The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1343(10 to 6), 1345(1 to 11), 1348(1 to 6), 1349(5 to 10), 1365(4 to 1), 1366(9 to 12), 1371(3 to 9), 1391(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1391: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1343: 1), (1345: 2), (1348: 1), (1349: 3), (1365: 6), (1366: 4), (1371: 5), (1391: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
