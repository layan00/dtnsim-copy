The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1016(10 to 6), 1018(1 to 11), 1022(1 to 6), 1023(5 to 10), 1038(4 to 1), 1039(9 to 12), 1044(3 to 9), 1062(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1016: 1), (1018: 2), (1022: 1), (1023: 3), (1038: 4), (1039: 4), (1044: 3), (1062: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
