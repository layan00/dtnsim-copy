The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(10 to 6), 198(1 to 11), 204(1 to 6), 205(5 to 10), 221(4 to 1), 222(9 to 12), 228(3 to 9), 248(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(205: 35.000000), (221: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 1), (198: 3), (204: 1), (205: 4), (221: 6), (222: 4), (228: 5), (248: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 67 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
