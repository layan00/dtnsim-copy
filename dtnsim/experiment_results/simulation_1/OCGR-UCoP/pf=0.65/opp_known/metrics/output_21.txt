The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
491(10 to 6), 493(1 to 11), 497(1 to 6), 498(5 to 10), 515(4 to 1), 516(9 to 12), 524(3 to 9), 542(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(516: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(491: 1), (493: 2), (497: 1), (498: 3), (515: 5), (516: 3), (524: 5), (542: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
