The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
197(10 to 6), 200(1 to 11), 204(1 to 6), 205(5 to 10), 222(4 to 1), 227(9 to 12), 232(3 to 9), 251(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(204: 15.000000), (227: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(197: 1), (200: 4), (204: 3), (205: 3), (222: 5), (227: 3), (232: 5), (251: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
