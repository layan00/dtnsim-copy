The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
743(10 to 6), 746(1 to 11), 749(1 to 6), 750(5 to 10), 769(4 to 1), 774(9 to 12), 783(3 to 9), 808(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(746: 35.000000), (749: 15.000000), (750: 35.000000), (774: 0.000000), (783: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(743: 1), (746: 4), (749: 3), (750: 4), (769: 4), (774: 3), (783: 6), (808: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
