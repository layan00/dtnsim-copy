The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1285(10 to 6), 1289(1 to 11), 1292(1 to 6), 1293(5 to 10), 1311(4 to 1), 1315(9 to 12), 1323(3 to 9), 1342(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1289: 55.000000), (1292: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1285: 1), (1289: 5), (1292: 3), (1293: 3), (1311: 2), (1315: 4), (1323: 3), (1342: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
