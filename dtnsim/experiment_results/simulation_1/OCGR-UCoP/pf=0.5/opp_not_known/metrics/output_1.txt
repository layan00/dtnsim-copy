The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
631(10 to 6), 645(1 to 11), 649(1 to 6), 650(5 to 10), 679(4 to 1), 681(9 to 12), 703(3 to 9), 733(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(681: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(631: 5), (645: 2), (649: 1), (650: 8), (679: 3), (681: 3), (703: 2), (733: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 98 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
