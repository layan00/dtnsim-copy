The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1856(10 to 6), 1871(1 to 11), 1874(1 to 6), 1875(5 to 10), 1904(4 to 1), 1905(9 to 12), 1924(3 to 9), 1953(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1905: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1856: 3), (1871: 2), (1874: 1), (1875: 4), (1904: 6), (1905: 3), (1924: 2), (1953: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 140 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
