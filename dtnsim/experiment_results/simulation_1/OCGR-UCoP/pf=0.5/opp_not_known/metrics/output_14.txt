The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1890(10 to 6), 1905(1 to 11), 1909(1 to 6), 1910(5 to 10), 1939(4 to 1), 1940(9 to 12), 1960(3 to 9), 1992(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1909: 25.000000), (1910: 55.000000), (1939: 140.000000), (1992: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1890: 1), (1905: 2), (1909: 2), (1910: 5), (1939: 6), (1940: 4), (1960: 2), (1992: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
