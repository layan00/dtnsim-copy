The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1035(10 to 6), 1051(1 to 11), 1054(1 to 6), 1055(5 to 10), 1083(4 to 1), 1084(9 to 12), 1102(3 to 9), 1131(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1083: 140.000000), (1084: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1035: 1), (1051: 2), (1054: 2), (1055: 4), (1083: 6), (1084: 3), (1102: 2), (1131: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 147 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
