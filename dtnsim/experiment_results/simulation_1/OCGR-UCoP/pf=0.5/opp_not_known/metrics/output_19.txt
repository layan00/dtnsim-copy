The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1852(10 to 6), 1867(1 to 11), 1873(1 to 6), 1874(5 to 10), 1903(4 to 1), 1904(9 to 12), 1927(3 to 9), 1955(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1867: 35.000000), (1904: 0.000000), (1927: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1852: 1), (1867: 3), (1873: 2), (1874: 4), (1903: 4), (1904: 3), (1927: 5), (1955: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 115 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
