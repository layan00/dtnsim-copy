The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1029(10 to 6), 1043(1 to 11), 1048(1 to 6), 1049(5 to 10), 1078(4 to 1), 1079(9 to 12), 1103(3 to 9), 1134(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1043: 35.000000), (1048: 25.000000), (1079: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1029: 1), (1043: 3), (1048: 2), (1049: 4), (1078: 3), (1079: 4), (1103: 3), (1134: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
