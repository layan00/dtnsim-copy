The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1437(10 to 6), 1452(1 to 11), 1457(1 to 6), 1458(5 to 10), 1487(4 to 1), 1492(9 to 12), 1511(3 to 9), 1541(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1457: 15.000000), (1511: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1437: 1), (1452: 3), (1457: 3), (1458: 4), (1487: 4), (1492: 4), (1511: 6), (1541: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 155 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
