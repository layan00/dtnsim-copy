The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(10 to 6), 226(1 to 11), 232(1 to 6), 233(5 to 10), 262(4 to 1), 267(9 to 12), 289(3 to 9), 320(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 55.000000), (226: 55.000000), (232: 15.000000), (267: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 3), (226: 6), (232: 3), (233: 4), (262: 5), (267: 3), (289: 2), (320: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 120 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
