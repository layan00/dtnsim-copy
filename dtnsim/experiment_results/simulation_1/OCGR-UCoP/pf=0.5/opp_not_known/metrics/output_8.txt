The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1453(10 to 6), 1469(1 to 11), 1474(1 to 6), 1475(5 to 10), 1505(4 to 1), 1507(9 to 12), 1526(3 to 9), 1556(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1475: 35.000000), (1507: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1453: 1), (1469: 3), (1474: 2), (1475: 3), (1505: 4), (1507: 3), (1526: 2), (1556: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 129 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
