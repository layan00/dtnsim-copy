The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(10 to 6), 232(1 to 11), 237(1 to 6), 238(5 to 10), 267(4 to 1), 272(9 to 12), 290(3 to 9), 320(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(237: 15.000000), (272: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 5), (232: 3), (237: 3), (238: 4), (267: 5), (272: 3), (290: 3), (320: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
