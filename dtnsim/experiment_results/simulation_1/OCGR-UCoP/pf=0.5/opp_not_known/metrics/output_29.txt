The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1845(10 to 6), 1860(1 to 11), 1865(1 to 6), 1866(5 to 10), 1895(4 to 1), 1899(9 to 12), 1922(3 to 9), 1953(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1860: 35.000000), (1865: 15.000000), (1866: 35.000000), (1899: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1845: 1), (1860: 3), (1865: 4), (1866: 3), (1895: 2), (1899: 3), (1922: 2), (1953: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 83 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
