The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1849(10 to 6), 1867(1 to 11), 1872(1 to 6), 1873(5 to 10), 1904(4 to 1), 1906(9 to 12), 1928(3 to 9), 1962(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1867: 55.000000), (1906: 55.000000), (1928: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1849: 5), (1867: 5), (1872: 2), (1873: 9), (1904: 3), (1906: 4), (1928: 5), (1962: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 136 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
