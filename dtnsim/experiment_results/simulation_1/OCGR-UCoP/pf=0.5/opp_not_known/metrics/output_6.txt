The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
628(10 to 6), 644(1 to 11), 647(1 to 6), 648(5 to 10), 678(4 to 1), 680(9 to 12), 700(3 to 9), 735(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(648: 55.000000), (680: 0.000000), (700: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(628: 4), (644: 2), (647: 1), (648: 9), (678: 2), (680: 3), (700: 6), (735: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 108 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
