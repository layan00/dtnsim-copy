The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1048(10 to 6), 1063(1 to 11), 1067(1 to 6), 1068(5 to 10), 1097(4 to 1), 1102(9 to 12), 1123(3 to 9), 1158(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1063: 55.000000), (1067: 15.000000), (1068: 55.000000), (1102: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1048: 3), (1063: 6), (1067: 3), (1068: 5), (1097: 5), (1102: 3), (1123: 2), (1158: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 134 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
