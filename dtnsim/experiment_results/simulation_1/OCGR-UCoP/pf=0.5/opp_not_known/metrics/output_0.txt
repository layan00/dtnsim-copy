The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(10 to 6), 233(1 to 11), 240(1 to 6), 241(5 to 10), 272(4 to 1), 273(9 to 12), 294(3 to 9), 325(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(240: 25.000000), (241: 35.000000), (272: 140.000000), (273: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 1), (233: 2), (240: 2), (241: 3), (272: 6), (273: 3), (294: 3), (325: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
