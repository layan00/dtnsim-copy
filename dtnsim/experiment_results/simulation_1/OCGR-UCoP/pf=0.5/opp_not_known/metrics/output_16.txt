The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
621(10 to 6), 635(1 to 11), 638(1 to 6), 639(5 to 10), 668(4 to 1), 669(9 to 12), 686(3 to 9), 715(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(668: 60.000000), (669: 55.000000), (686: 65.000000), (715: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(621: 1), (635: 2), (638: 2), (639: 4), (668: 4), (669: 4), (686: 5), (715: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 93 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
