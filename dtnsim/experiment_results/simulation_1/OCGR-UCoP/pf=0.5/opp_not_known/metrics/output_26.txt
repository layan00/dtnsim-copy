The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
611(10 to 6), 627(1 to 11), 632(1 to 6), 633(5 to 10), 663(4 to 1), 664(9 to 12), 684(3 to 9), 715(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(633: 55.000000), (664: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(611: 4), (627: 2), (632: 2), (633: 4), (663: 2), (664: 3), (684: 3), (715: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 160 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
