The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
634(10 to 6), 648(1 to 11), 652(1 to 6), 653(5 to 10), 682(4 to 1), 684(9 to 12), 706(3 to 9), 737(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(653: 35.000000), (684: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(634: 1), (648: 2), (652: 1), (653: 7), (682: 5), (684: 3), (706: 3), (737: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 85 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
