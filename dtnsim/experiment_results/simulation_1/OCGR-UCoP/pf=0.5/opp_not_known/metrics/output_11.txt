The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
630(10 to 6), 645(1 to 11), 649(1 to 6), 650(5 to 10), 678(4 to 1), 683(9 to 12), 700(3 to 9), 733(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(630: 105.000000), (649: 15.000000), (678: 60.000000), (683: 55.000000), (733: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(630: 5), (645: 3), (649: 3), (650: 5), (678: 4), (683: 4), (700: 2), (733: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 128 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
