The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1863(10 to 6), 1880(1 to 11), 1884(1 to 6), 1885(5 to 10), 1914(4 to 1), 1915(9 to 12), 1933(3 to 9), 1965(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1915: 55.000000), (1933: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1863: 5), (1880: 2), (1884: 2), (1885: 4), (1914: 3), (1915: 4), (1933: 5), (1965: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
