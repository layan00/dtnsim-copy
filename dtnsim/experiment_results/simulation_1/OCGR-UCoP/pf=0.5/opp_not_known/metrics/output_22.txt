The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1040(10 to 6), 1055(1 to 11), 1059(1 to 6), 1060(5 to 10), 1091(4 to 1), 1096(9 to 12), 1114(3 to 9), 1144(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1059: 15.000000), (1096: 0.000000), (1114: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1040: 1), (1055: 2), (1059: 4), (1060: 5), (1091: 6), (1096: 3), (1114: 6), (1144: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 115 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
