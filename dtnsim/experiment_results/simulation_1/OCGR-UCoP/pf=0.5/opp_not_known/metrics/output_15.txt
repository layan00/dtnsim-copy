The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(10 to 6), 227(1 to 11), 231(1 to 6), 232(5 to 10), 261(4 to 1), 263(9 to 12), 279(3 to 9), 309(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 60.000000), (263: 55.000000), (279: 65.000000), (309: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 1), (227: 2), (231: 1), (232: 5), (261: 4), (263: 4), (279: 5), (309: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 65 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
