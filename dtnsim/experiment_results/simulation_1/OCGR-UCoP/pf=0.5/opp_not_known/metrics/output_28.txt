The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1431(10 to 6), 1446(1 to 11), 1451(1 to 6), 1452(5 to 10), 1479(4 to 1), 1480(9 to 12), 1500(3 to 9), 1536(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1480: 0.000000), (1500: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1431: 1), (1446: 2), (1451: 1), (1452: 5), (1479: 4), (1480: 3), (1500: 4), (1536: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 78 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
