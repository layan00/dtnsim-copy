The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1439(10 to 6), 1454(1 to 11), 1458(1 to 6), 1459(5 to 10), 1489(4 to 1), 1490(9 to 12), 1511(3 to 9), 1542(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1489: 60.000000), (1490: 0.000000), (1542: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1439: 1), (1454: 2), (1458: 2), (1459: 4), (1489: 4), (1490: 3), (1511: 5), (1542: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
