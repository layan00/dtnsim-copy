The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(10 to 6), 225(1 to 11), 229(1 to 6), 230(5 to 10), 257(4 to 1), 258(9 to 12), 278(3 to 9), 306(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 3), (225: 2), (229: 1), (230: 4), (257: 4), (258: 4), (278: 2), (306: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 25 calls to RUCoP, which took 168 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
