The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1019(10 to 6), 1034(1 to 11), 1037(1 to 6), 1038(5 to 10), 1068(4 to 1), 1070(9 to 12), 1093(3 to 9), 1125(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1034: 35.000000), (1037: 25.000000), (1038: 35.000000), (1070: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1019: 1), (1034: 4), (1037: 2), (1038: 3), (1068: 3), (1070: 3), (1093: 2), (1125: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
