The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
500(10 to 6), 503(1 to 11), 507(1 to 6), 508(5 to 10), 526(4 to 1), 531(9 to 12), 536(3 to 9), 561(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(500: 105.000000), (507: 15.000000), (508: 35.000000), (526: 60.000000), (531: 55.000000), (536: 15.000000), (561: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(500: 5), (503: 4), (507: 3), (508: 4), (526: 4), (531: 4), (536: 6), (561: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
