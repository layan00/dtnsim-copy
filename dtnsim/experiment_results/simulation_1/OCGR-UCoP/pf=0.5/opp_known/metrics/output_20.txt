The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
207(10 to 6), 212(1 to 11), 220(1 to 6), 221(5 to 10), 241(4 to 1), 245(9 to 12), 252(3 to 9), 273(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 15.000000), (221: 35.000000), (245: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(207: 1), (212: 3), (220: 3), (221: 4), (241: 4), (245: 3), (252: 5), (273: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
