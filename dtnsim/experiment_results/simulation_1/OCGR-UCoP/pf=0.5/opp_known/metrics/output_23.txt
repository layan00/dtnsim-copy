The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1083(10 to 6), 1088(1 to 11), 1095(1 to 6), 1096(5 to 10), 1115(4 to 1), 1116(9 to 12), 1122(3 to 9), 1143(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1096: 35.000000), (1116: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1083: 1), (1088: 3), (1095: 1), (1096: 4), (1115: 4), (1116: 3), (1122: 5), (1143: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
