The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
775(10 to 6), 777(1 to 11), 782(1 to 6), 783(5 to 10), 799(4 to 1), 800(9 to 12), 811(3 to 9), 830(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(777: 35.000000), (800: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(775: 1), (777: 3), (782: 1), (783: 3), (799: 3), (800: 4), (811: 3), (830: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
