The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1105(10 to 6), 1112(1 to 11), 1117(1 to 6), 1118(5 to 10), 1136(4 to 1), 1140(9 to 12), 1148(3 to 9), 1173(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1105: 105.000000), (1112: 55.000000), (1117: 15.000000), (1118: 35.000000), (1140: 55.000000), (1148: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1105: 6), (1112: 5), (1117: 3), (1118: 4), (1136: 4), (1140: 4), (1148: 4), (1173: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
