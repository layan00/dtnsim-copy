The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
487(10 to 6), 489(1 to 11), 492(1 to 6), 493(5 to 10), 509(4 to 1), 510(9 to 12), 515(3 to 9), 537(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(509: 60.000000), (510: 55.000000), (515: 15.000000), (537: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(487: 1), (489: 2), (492: 1), (493: 3), (509: 4), (510: 4), (515: 6), (537: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
