The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1370(10 to 6), 1373(1 to 11), 1376(1 to 6), 1377(5 to 10), 1394(4 to 1), 1395(9 to 12), 1402(3 to 9), 1421(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1395: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1370: 3), (1373: 2), (1376: 1), (1377: 3), (1394: 6), (1395: 3), (1402: 5), (1421: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
