The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1369(10 to 6), 1372(1 to 11), 1377(1 to 6), 1378(5 to 10), 1397(4 to 1), 1401(9 to 12), 1411(3 to 9), 1435(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1372: 35.000000), (1377: 15.000000), (1378: 35.000000), (1401: 0.000000), (1411: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1369: 1), (1372: 3), (1377: 3), (1378: 4), (1397: 2), (1401: 3), (1411: 6), (1435: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
