The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
499(10 to 6), 503(1 to 11), 506(1 to 6), 507(5 to 10), 525(4 to 1), 526(9 to 12), 533(3 to 9), 559(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(526: 0.000000), (533: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(499: 4), (503: 2), (506: 1), (507: 3), (525: 2), (526: 3), (533: 6), (559: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
