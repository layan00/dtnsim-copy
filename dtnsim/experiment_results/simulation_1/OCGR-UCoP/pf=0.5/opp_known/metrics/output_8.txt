The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1080(10 to 6), 1084(1 to 11), 1089(1 to 6), 1090(5 to 10), 1109(4 to 1), 1114(9 to 12), 1120(3 to 9), 1140(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1089: 15.000000), (1090: 35.000000), (1114: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1080: 1), (1084: 4), (1089: 3), (1090: 4), (1109: 4), (1114: 3), (1120: 5), (1140: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
