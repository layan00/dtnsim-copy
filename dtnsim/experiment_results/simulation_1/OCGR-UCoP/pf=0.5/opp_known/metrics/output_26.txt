The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
483(10 to 6), 487(1 to 11), 492(1 to 6), 493(5 to 10), 512(4 to 1), 516(9 to 12), 523(3 to 9), 542(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(492: 15.000000), (493: 55.000000), (516: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(483: 4), (487: 3), (492: 3), (493: 5), (512: 2), (516: 3), (523: 3), (542: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
