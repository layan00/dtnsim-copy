The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
788(10 to 6), 790(1 to 11), 794(1 to 6), 795(5 to 10), 812(4 to 1), 816(9 to 12), 824(3 to 9), 844(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(790: 55.000000), (794: 15.000000), (812: 140.000000), (816: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(788: 1), (790: 5), (794: 3), (795: 3), (812: 6), (816: 3), (824: 3), (844: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
