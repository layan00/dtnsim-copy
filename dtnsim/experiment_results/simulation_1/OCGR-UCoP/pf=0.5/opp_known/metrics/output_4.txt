The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1364(10 to 6), 1370(1 to 11), 1375(1 to 6), 1376(5 to 10), 1394(4 to 1), 1398(9 to 12), 1407(3 to 9), 1427(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1370: 55.000000), (1375: 15.000000), (1398: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1364: 5), (1370: 5), (1375: 3), (1376: 3), (1394: 3), (1398: 4), (1407: 3), (1427: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
