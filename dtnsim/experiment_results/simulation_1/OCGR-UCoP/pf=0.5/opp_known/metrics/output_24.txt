The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1375(10 to 6), 1380(1 to 11), 1384(1 to 6), 1385(5 to 10), 1401(4 to 1), 1402(9 to 12), 1408(3 to 9), 1430(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1402: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1375: 5), (1380: 2), (1384: 1), (1385: 3), (1401: 3), (1402: 4), (1408: 5), (1430: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
