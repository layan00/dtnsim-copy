The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
501(10 to 6), 503(1 to 11), 507(1 to 6), 508(5 to 10), 525(4 to 1), 527(9 to 12), 537(3 to 9), 560(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 0.000000), (537: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(501: 5), (503: 2), (507: 1), (508: 8), (525: 3), (527: 3), (537: 5), (560: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 5 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
