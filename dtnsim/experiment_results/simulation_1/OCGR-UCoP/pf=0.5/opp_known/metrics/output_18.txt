The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1063(10 to 6), 1066(1 to 11), 1070(1 to 6), 1071(5 to 10), 1088(4 to 1), 1089(9 to 12), 1098(3 to 9), 1117(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1088: 60.000000), (1089: 0.000000), (1117: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1063: 1), (1066: 2), (1070: 1), (1071: 3), (1088: 4), (1089: 3), (1098: 3), (1117: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
