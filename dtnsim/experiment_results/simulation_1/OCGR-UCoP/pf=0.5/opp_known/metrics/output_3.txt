The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1074(10 to 6), 1077(1 to 11), 1082(1 to 6), 1083(5 to 10), 1100(4 to 1), 1105(9 to 12), 1112(3 to 9), 1130(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1082: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1074: 1), (1077: 4), (1082: 3), (1083: 3), (1100: 4), (1105: 4), (1112: 3), (1130: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
