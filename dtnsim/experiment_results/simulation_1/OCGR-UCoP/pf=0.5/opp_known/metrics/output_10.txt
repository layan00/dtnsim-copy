The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(10 to 6), 208(1 to 11), 213(1 to 6), 214(5 to 10), 231(4 to 1), 237(9 to 12), 243(3 to 9), 263(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 15.000000), (237: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 5), (208: 4), (213: 3), (214: 3), (231: 5), (237: 3), (243: 5), (263: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
