The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(10 to 6), 201(1 to 11), 205(1 to 6), 206(5 to 10), 223(4 to 1), 224(9 to 12), 231(3 to 9), 249(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 3), (201: 2), (205: 1), (206: 5), (223: 4), (224: 4), (231: 5), (249: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
