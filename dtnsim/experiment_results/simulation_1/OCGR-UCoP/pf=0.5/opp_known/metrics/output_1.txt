The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
502(10 to 6), 504(1 to 11), 508(1 to 6), 509(5 to 10), 526(4 to 1), 527(9 to 12), 535(3 to 9), 558(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 0.000000), (535: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(502: 5), (504: 2), (508: 1), (509: 3), (526: 3), (527: 3), (535: 6), (558: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
