The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(10 to 6), 209(1 to 11), 216(1 to 6), 217(5 to 10), 235(4 to 1), 239(9 to 12), 247(3 to 9), 268(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(216: 15.000000), (217: 35.000000), (235: 140.000000), (239: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 1), (209: 3), (216: 3), (217: 3), (235: 6), (239: 3), (247: 4), (268: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
