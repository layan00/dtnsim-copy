The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1074(10 to 6), 1077(1 to 11), 1082(1 to 6), 1083(5 to 10), 1100(4 to 1), 1101(9 to 12), 1109(3 to 9), 1132(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1083: 35.000000), (1101: 0.000000), (1109: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1074: 1), (1077: 2), (1082: 1), (1083: 4), (1100: 4), (1101: 3), (1109: 4), (1132: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
