The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
775(10 to 6), 778(1 to 11), 781(1 to 6), 782(5 to 10), 801(4 to 1), 806(9 to 12), 815(3 to 9), 840(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(778: 35.000000), (781: 15.000000), (782: 35.000000), (806: 0.000000), (815: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(775: 1), (778: 4), (781: 3), (782: 4), (801: 3), (806: 3), (815: 6), (840: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
