The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
790(10 to 6), 794(1 to 11), 797(1 to 6), 798(5 to 10), 814(4 to 1), 815(9 to 12), 821(3 to 9), 840(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(814: 140.000000), (815: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(790: 1), (794: 3), (797: 1), (798: 4), (814: 6), (815: 3), (821: 4), (840: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 5 calls to RUCoP, which took 8 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
