The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(10 to 6), 203(1 to 11), 207(1 to 6), 208(5 to 10), 225(4 to 1), 226(9 to 12), 230(3 to 9), 250(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 60.000000), (226: 55.000000), (250: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 1), (203: 2), (207: 1), (208: 3), (225: 4), (226: 4), (230: 5), (250: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
