The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1354(10 to 6), 1357(1 to 11), 1363(1 to 6), 1364(5 to 10), 1382(4 to 1), 1383(9 to 12), 1393(3 to 9), 1414(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1357: 35.000000), (1383: 0.000000), (1393: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1354: 1), (1357: 3), (1363: 1), (1364: 5), (1382: 4), (1383: 3), (1393: 6), (1414: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
