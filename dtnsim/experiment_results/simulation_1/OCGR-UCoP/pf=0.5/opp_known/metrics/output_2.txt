The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
788(10 to 6), 792(1 to 11), 795(1 to 6), 796(5 to 10), 812(4 to 1), 813(9 to 12), 819(3 to 9), 838(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(812: 140.000000), (813: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(788: 1), (792: 3), (795: 1), (796: 3), (812: 6), (813: 3), (819: 5), (838: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
