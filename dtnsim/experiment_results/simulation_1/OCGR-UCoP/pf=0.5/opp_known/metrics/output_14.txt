The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1410(10 to 6), 1413(1 to 11), 1417(1 to 6), 1418(5 to 10), 1436(4 to 1), 1437(9 to 12), 1444(3 to 9), 1465(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1418: 35.000000), (1436: 140.000000), (1465: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1410: 1), (1413: 2), (1417: 1), (1418: 4), (1436: 6), (1437: 4), (1444: 5), (1465: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
