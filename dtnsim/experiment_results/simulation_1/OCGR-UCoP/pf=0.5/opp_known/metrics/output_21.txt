The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
504(10 to 6), 506(1 to 11), 510(1 to 6), 511(5 to 10), 528(4 to 1), 529(9 to 12), 537(3 to 9), 560(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(529: 0.000000), (537: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(504: 1), (506: 2), (510: 1), (511: 3), (528: 5), (529: 3), (537: 6), (560: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 506: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
