The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
790(10 to 6), 793(1 to 11), 797(1 to 6), 798(5 to 10), 817(4 to 1), 821(9 to 12), 827(3 to 9), 850(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(797: 15.000000), (821: 0.000000), (827: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(790: 1), (793: 3), (797: 3), (798: 3), (817: 6), (821: 3), (827: 6), (850: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
