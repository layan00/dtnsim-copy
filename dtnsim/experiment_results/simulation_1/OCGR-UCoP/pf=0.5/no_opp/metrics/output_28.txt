The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
381(10 to 6), 384(1 to 11), 389(1 to 6), 390(5 to 10), 394(4 to 1), 395(9 to 12), 400(3 to 9), 408(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(400: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(381: 1), (384: 2), (389: 2), (390: 2), (394: 4), (395: 1), (400: 4), (408: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
