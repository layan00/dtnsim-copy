The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
177(10 to 6), 180(1 to 11), 184(1 to 6), 185(5 to 10), 189(4 to 1), 192(9 to 12), 195(3 to 9), 202(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(177: 105.000000), (189: 60.000000), (202: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(177: 5), (180: 3), (184: 4), (185: 2), (189: 4), (192: 1), (195: 2), (202: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
