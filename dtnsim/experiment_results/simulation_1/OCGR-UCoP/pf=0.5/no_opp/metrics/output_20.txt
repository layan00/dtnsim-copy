The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
75(10 to 6), 80(1 to 11), 88(1 to 6), 89(5 to 10), 96(4 to 1), 97(9 to 12), 104(3 to 9), 109(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(88: 25.000000), (89: 35.000000), (104: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(75: 1), (80: 2), (88: 2), (89: 3), (96: 1), (97: 2), (104: 5), (109: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
