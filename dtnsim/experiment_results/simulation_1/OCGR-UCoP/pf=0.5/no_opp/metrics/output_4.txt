The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
477(10 to 6), 483(1 to 11), 488(1 to 6), 489(5 to 10), 494(4 to 1), 495(9 to 12), 504(3 to 9), 511(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(495: 55.000000), (504: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(477: 5), (483: 3), (488: 2), (489: 1), (494: 3), (495: 4), (504: 5), (511: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
