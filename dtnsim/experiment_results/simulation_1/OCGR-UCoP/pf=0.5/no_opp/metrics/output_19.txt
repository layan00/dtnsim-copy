The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
488(10 to 6), 491(1 to 11), 497(1 to 6), 498(5 to 10), 503(4 to 1), 504(9 to 12), 512(3 to 9), 514(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(491: 35.000000), (512: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(488: 1), (491: 3), (497: 2), (498: 4), (503: 1), (504: 1), (512: 5), (514: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
