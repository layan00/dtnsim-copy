The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
71(10 to 6), 76(1 to 11), 81(1 to 6), 82(5 to 10), 85(4 to 1), 89(9 to 12), 92(3 to 9), 96(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(71: 5), (76: 3), (81: 4), (82: 1), (85: 1), (89: 1), (92: 3), (96: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 76: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
