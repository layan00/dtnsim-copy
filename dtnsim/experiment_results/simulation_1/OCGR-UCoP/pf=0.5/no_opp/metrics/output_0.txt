The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
73(10 to 6), 77(1 to 11), 84(1 to 6), 85(5 to 10), 92(4 to 1), 93(9 to 12), 100(3 to 9), 105(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(84: 25.000000), (85: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(73: 1), (77: 2), (84: 2), (85: 3), (92: 1), (93: 2), (100: 3), (105: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 77: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 84: (to: 2, time: 30.000000),

Bundle 100: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 85: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 92: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 85: (to: 4, time: 30.000000),
