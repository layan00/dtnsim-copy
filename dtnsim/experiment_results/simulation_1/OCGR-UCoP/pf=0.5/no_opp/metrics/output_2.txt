The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
282(10 to 6), 286(1 to 11), 289(1 to 6), 290(5 to 10), 292(4 to 1), 293(9 to 12), 296(3 to 9), 299(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(282: 1), (286: 2), (289: 2), (290: 1), (292: 1), (293: 1), (296: 2), (299: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 286: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 289: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 286: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 296: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 292: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 290: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 293: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10:
