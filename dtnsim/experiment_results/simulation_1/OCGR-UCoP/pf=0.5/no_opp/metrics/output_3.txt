The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
374(10 to 6), 377(1 to 11), 382(1 to 6), 383(5 to 10), 387(4 to 1), 389(9 to 12), 395(3 to 9), 399(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(382: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(374: 1), (377: 3), (382: 2), (383: 1), (387: 1), (389: 1), (395: 4), (399: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 377: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 382: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 382: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 377: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 395: (to: 6, time: 60.000000),

Bundle 387: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 383: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Bundle 395: (to: 12, time: 110.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 395: (to: 5, time: 80.000000), (to: 5, time: 100.000000),
