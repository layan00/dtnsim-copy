The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(10 to 6), 182(1 to 11), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/2) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(180: 2), (182: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 1 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 3 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 182: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 180: (to: 5, time: 30.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 180: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Node 14: 
Node 15:
