The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
375(10 to 6), 379(1 to 11), 384(1 to 6), 385(5 to 10), 391(4 to 1), 393(9 to 12), 397(3 to 9), 401(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(385: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(375: 1), (379: 3), (384: 2), (385: 3), (391: 1), (393: 1), (397: 2), (401: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 379: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 384: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 384: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 379: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 397: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 385: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 391: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 385: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7:
