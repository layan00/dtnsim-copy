The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
513(10 to 6), 516(1 to 11), 520(1 to 6), 521(5 to 10), 526(4 to 1), 527(9 to 12), 534(3 to 9), 538(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(520: 25.000000), (538: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(513: 1), (516: 2), (520: 2), (521: 2), (526: 1), (527: 2), (534: 2), (538: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 516: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 520: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 520: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 534: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 521: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 526: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 521: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 538: (to: 1, time: 110.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 527: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9:
