The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(10 to 6), 174(1 to 11), 177(1 to 6), 178(5 to 10), 181(4 to 1), 182(9 to 12), 185(3 to 9), 190(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(181: 60.000000), (185: 65.000000), (190: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 1), (174: 2), (177: 2), (178: 1), (181: 4), (182: 1), (185: 5), (190: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
