The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
68(10 to 6), 71(1 to 11), 75(1 to 6), 76(5 to 10), 79(4 to 1), 80(9 to 12), 83(3 to 9), 89(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(79: 60.000000), (83: 65.000000), (89: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(68: 1), (71: 2), (75: 2), (76: 1), (79: 4), (80: 2), (83: 5), (89: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 71: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
