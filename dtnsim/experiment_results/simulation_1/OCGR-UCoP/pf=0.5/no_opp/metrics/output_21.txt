The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
186(10 to 6), 188(1 to 11), 192(1 to 6), 193(5 to 10), 196(4 to 1), 197(9 to 12), 204(3 to 9), 208(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 1), (188: 2), (192: 2), (193: 1), (196: 1), (197: 3), (204: 3), (208: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 188: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
