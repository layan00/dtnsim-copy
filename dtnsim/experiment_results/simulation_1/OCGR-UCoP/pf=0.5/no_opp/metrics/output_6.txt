The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(10 to 6), 177(1 to 11), 180(1 to 6), 181(5 to 10), 185(4 to 1), 186(9 to 12), 192(3 to 9), 202(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 4), (177: 2), (180: 2), (181: 1), (185: 2), (186: 4), (192: 4), (202: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
