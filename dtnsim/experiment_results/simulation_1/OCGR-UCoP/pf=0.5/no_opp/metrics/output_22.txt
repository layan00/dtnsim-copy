The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
282(10 to 6), 285(1 to 11), 289(1 to 6), 290(5 to 10), 295(4 to 1), 297(9 to 12), 301(3 to 9), 305(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(289: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(282: 1), (285: 2), (289: 4), (290: 1), (295: 1), (297: 2), (301: 4), (305: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 285: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 289: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3:
