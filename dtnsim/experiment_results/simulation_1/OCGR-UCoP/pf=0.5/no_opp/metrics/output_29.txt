The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
491(10 to 6), 494(1 to 11), 499(1 to 6), 500(5 to 10), 505(4 to 1), 507(9 to 12), 516(3 to 9), 523(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(494: 35.000000), (500: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(491: 1), (494: 3), (499: 4), (500: 3), (505: 2), (507: 2), (516: 2), (523: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 494: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 499: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2:
