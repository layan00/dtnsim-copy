The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
277(10 to 6), 279(1 to 11), 283(1 to 6), 284(5 to 10), 288(4 to 1), 289(9 to 12), 294(3 to 9), 298(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(277: 1), (279: 3), (283: 2), (284: 1), (288: 1), (289: 1), (294: 4), (298: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
