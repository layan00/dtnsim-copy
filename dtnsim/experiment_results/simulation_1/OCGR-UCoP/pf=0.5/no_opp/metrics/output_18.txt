The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
380(10 to 6), 383(1 to 11), 387(1 to 6), 388(5 to 10), 392(4 to 1), 393(9 to 12), 399(3 to 9), 406(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(392: 60.000000), (406: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(380: 1), (383: 2), (387: 2), (388: 1), (392: 4), (393: 1), (399: 5), (406: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
