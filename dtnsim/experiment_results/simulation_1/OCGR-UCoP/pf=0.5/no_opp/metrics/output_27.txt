The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
272(10 to 6), 275(1 to 11), 278(1 to 6), 279(5 to 10), 285(4 to 1), 287(9 to 12), 295(3 to 9), 303(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(275: 35.000000), (278: 25.000000), (279: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(272: 1), (275: 4), (278: 2), (279: 3), (285: 3), (287: 1), (295: 2), (303: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 275: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
