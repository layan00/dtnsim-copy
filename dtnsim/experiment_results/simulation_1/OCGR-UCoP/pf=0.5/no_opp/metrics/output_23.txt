The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
383(10 to 6), 388(1 to 11), 395(1 to 6), 396(5 to 10), 402(4 to 1), 403(9 to 12), 408(3 to 9), 412(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(383: 1), (388: 2), (395: 2), (396: 2), (402: 1), (403: 3), (408: 2), (412: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 388: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
