The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
275(10 to 6), 277(1 to 11), 282(1 to 6), 283(5 to 10), 286(4 to 1), 287(9 to 12), 297(3 to 9), 304(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(277: 35.000000), (282: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(275: 1), (277: 3), (282: 2), (283: 1), (286: 3), (287: 1), (297: 3), (304: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 277: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
