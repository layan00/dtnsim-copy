The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
394(10 to 6), 401(1 to 11), 406(1 to 6), 407(5 to 10), 411(4 to 1), 413(9 to 12), 422(3 to 9), 431(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(394: 105.000000), (406: 25.000000), (413: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(394: 6), (401: 3), (406: 3), (407: 2), (411: 4), (413: 4), (422: 4), (431: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
