The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(10 to 6), 182(1 to 11), 186(1 to 6), 187(5 to 10), 191(4 to 1), 192(9 to 12), 200(3 to 9), 207(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(186: 25.000000), (192: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(180: 5), (182: 2), (186: 2), (187: 1), (191: 3), (192: 4), (200: 2), (207: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 182: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
