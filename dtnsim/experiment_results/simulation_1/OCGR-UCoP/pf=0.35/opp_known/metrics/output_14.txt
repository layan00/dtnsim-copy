The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1453(10 to 6), 1457(1 to 11), 1462(1 to 6), 1463(5 to 10), 1481(4 to 1), 1482(9 to 12), 1492(3 to 9), 1513(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1457: 35.000000), (1463: 35.000000), (1513: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1453: 1), (1457: 3), (1462: 1), (1463: 4), (1481: 2), (1482: 4), (1492: 5), (1513: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
