The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
503(10 to 6), 506(1 to 11), 509(1 to 6), 510(5 to 10), 526(4 to 1), 527(9 to 12), 535(3 to 9), 556(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(526: 60.000000), (527: 55.000000), (535: 15.000000), (556: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(503: 1), (506: 2), (509: 1), (510: 3), (526: 4), (527: 4), (535: 4), (556: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
