The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
816(10 to 6), 821(1 to 11), 826(1 to 6), 827(5 to 10), 847(4 to 1), 851(9 to 12), 862(3 to 9), 887(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(821: 35.000000), (826: 15.000000), (827: 35.000000), (851: 0.000000), (862: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(816: 1), (821: 3), (826: 3), (827: 4), (847: 3), (851: 3), (862: 4), (887: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
