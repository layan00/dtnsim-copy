The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
533(10 to 6), 538(1 to 11), 543(1 to 6), 544(5 to 10), 562(4 to 1), 563(9 to 12), 571(3 to 9), 597(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(533: 105.000000), (544: 35.000000), (562: 60.000000), (563: 0.000000), (571: 15.000000), (597: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(533: 5), (538: 2), (543: 1), (544: 4), (562: 4), (563: 3), (571: 6), (597: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
