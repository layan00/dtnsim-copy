The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
510(10 to 6), 514(1 to 11), 521(1 to 6), 522(5 to 10), 541(4 to 1), 546(9 to 12), 554(3 to 9), 572(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(521: 15.000000), (522: 55.000000), (546: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(510: 5), (514: 3), (521: 3), (522: 5), (541: 2), (546: 3), (554: 3), (572: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
