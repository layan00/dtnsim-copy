The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1127(10 to 6), 1130(1 to 11), 1137(1 to 6), 1138(5 to 10), 1156(4 to 1), 1161(9 to 12), 1169(3 to 9), 1192(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1137: 15.000000), (1138: 35.000000), (1161: 0.000000), (1169: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1127: 1), (1130: 4), (1137: 3), (1138: 4), (1156: 4), (1161: 3), (1169: 4), (1192: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
