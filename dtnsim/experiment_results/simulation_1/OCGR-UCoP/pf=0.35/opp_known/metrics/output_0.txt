The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(10 to 6), 219(1 to 11), 226(1 to 6), 227(5 to 10), 247(4 to 1), 251(9 to 12), 262(3 to 9), 286(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 35.000000), (226: 15.000000), (227: 35.000000), (247: 140.000000), (251: 0.000000), (262: 15.000000), (286: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 1), (219: 3), (226: 3), (227: 4), (247: 6), (251: 3), (262: 4), (286: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
