The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(10 to 6), 217(1 to 11), 226(1 to 6), 227(5 to 10), 247(4 to 1), 253(9 to 12), 263(3 to 9), 284(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(211: 45.000000), (217: 35.000000), (226: 15.000000), (227: 35.000000), (253: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(211: 4), (217: 3), (226: 3), (227: 4), (247: 4), (253: 3), (263: 5), (284: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
