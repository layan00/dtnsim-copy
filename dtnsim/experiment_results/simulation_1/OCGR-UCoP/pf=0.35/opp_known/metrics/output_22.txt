The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
823(10 to 6), 827(1 to 11), 832(1 to 6), 833(5 to 10), 852(4 to 1), 856(9 to 12), 863(3 to 9), 887(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(832: 15.000000), (856: 0.000000), (863: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(823: 1), (827: 3), (832: 3), (833: 3), (852: 6), (856: 3), (863: 6), (887: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
