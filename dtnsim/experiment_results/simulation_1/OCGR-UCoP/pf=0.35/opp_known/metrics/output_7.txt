The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
829(10 to 6), 832(1 to 11), 837(1 to 6), 838(5 to 10), 856(4 to 1), 860(9 to 12), 870(3 to 9), 892(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(832: 35.000000), (837: 15.000000), (860: 0.000000), (870: 15.000000), (892: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(829: 1), (832: 3), (837: 3), (838: 3), (856: 2), (860: 3), (870: 4), (892: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
