The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1441(10 to 6), 1447(1 to 11), 1451(1 to 6), 1452(5 to 10), 1469(4 to 1), 1470(9 to 12), 1478(3 to 9), 1503(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1441: 105.000000), (1470: 0.000000), (1478: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1441: 5), (1447: 2), (1451: 1), (1452: 3), (1469: 4), (1470: 3), (1478: 4), (1503: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
