The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1405(10 to 6), 1408(1 to 11), 1414(1 to 6), 1415(5 to 10), 1434(4 to 1), 1435(9 to 12), 1447(3 to 9), 1470(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1408: 35.000000), (1415: 35.000000), (1434: 140.000000), (1435: 0.000000), (1447: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1405: 1), (1408: 3), (1414: 1), (1415: 4), (1434: 6), (1435: 3), (1447: 6), (1470: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
