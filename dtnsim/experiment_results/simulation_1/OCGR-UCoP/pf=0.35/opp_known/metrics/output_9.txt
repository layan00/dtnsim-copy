The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1451(10 to 6), 1455(1 to 11), 1458(1 to 6), 1459(5 to 10), 1477(4 to 1), 1478(9 to 12), 1488(3 to 9), 1507(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1478: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1451: 3), (1455: 2), (1458: 1), (1459: 3), (1477: 6), (1478: 3), (1488: 5), (1507: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
