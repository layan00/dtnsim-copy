The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1129(10 to 6), 1135(1 to 11), 1144(1 to 6), 1145(5 to 10), 1164(4 to 1), 1167(9 to 12), 1173(3 to 9), 1198(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1129: 45.000000), (1145: 35.000000), (1167: 0.000000), (1173: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1129: 4), (1135: 3), (1144: 1), (1145: 4), (1164: 4), (1167: 3), (1173: 6), (1198: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
