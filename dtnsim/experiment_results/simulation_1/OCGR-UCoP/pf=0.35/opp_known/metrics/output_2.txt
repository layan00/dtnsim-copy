The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
843(10 to 6), 848(1 to 11), 852(1 to 6), 853(5 to 10), 870(4 to 1), 874(9 to 12), 883(3 to 9), 902(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(852: 15.000000), (870: 140.000000), (874: 0.000000), (902: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(843: 1), (848: 3), (852: 3), (853: 3), (870: 6), (874: 3), (883: 3), (902: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
