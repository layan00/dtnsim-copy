The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
523(10 to 6), 526(1 to 11), 532(1 to 6), 533(5 to 10), 550(4 to 1), 552(9 to 12), 561(3 to 9), 584(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(523: 105.000000), (552: 0.000000), (561: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(523: 5), (526: 2), (532: 1), (533: 3), (550: 5), (552: 3), (561: 6), (584: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
