The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
522(10 to 6), 527(1 to 11), 533(1 to 6), 534(5 to 10), 552(4 to 1), 555(9 to 12), 564(3 to 9), 589(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(522: 45.000000), (555: 0.000000), (564: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(522: 4), (527: 2), (533: 1), (534: 3), (552: 3), (555: 3), (564: 6), (589: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
