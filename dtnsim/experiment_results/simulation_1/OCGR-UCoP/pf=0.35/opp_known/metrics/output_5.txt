The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(10 to 6), 212(1 to 11), 219(1 to 6), 220(5 to 10), 238(4 to 1), 244(9 to 12), 254(3 to 9), 275(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(208: 45.000000), (212: 55.000000), (219: 15.000000), (244: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 4), (212: 5), (219: 3), (220: 3), (238: 3), (244: 3), (254: 3), (275: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
