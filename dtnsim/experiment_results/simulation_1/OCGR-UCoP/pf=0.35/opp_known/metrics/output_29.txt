The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1436(10 to 6), 1439(1 to 11), 1445(1 to 6), 1446(5 to 10), 1465(4 to 1), 1469(9 to 12), 1480(3 to 9), 1504(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1439: 35.000000), (1445: 15.000000), (1446: 35.000000), (1469: 0.000000), (1480: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1436: 1), (1439: 3), (1445: 3), (1446: 4), (1465: 2), (1469: 3), (1480: 4), (1504: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
