The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1103(10 to 6), 1107(1 to 11), 1112(1 to 6), 1113(5 to 10), 1130(4 to 1), 1133(9 to 12), 1143(3 to 9), 1162(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1103: 45.000000), (1130: 60.000000), (1133: 0.000000), (1162: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1103: 4), (1107: 2), (1112: 1), (1113: 3), (1130: 4), (1133: 3), (1143: 3), (1162: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
