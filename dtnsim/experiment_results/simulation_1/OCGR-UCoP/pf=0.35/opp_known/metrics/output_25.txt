The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
207(10 to 6), 211(1 to 11), 217(1 to 6), 218(5 to 10), 236(4 to 1), 237(9 to 12), 246(3 to 9), 267(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 55.000000), (246: 15.000000), (267: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(207: 5), (211: 2), (217: 1), (218: 5), (236: 5), (237: 4), (246: 4), (267: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
