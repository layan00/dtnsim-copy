The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(10 to 6), 206(1 to 11), 210(1 to 6), 211(5 to 10), 229(4 to 1), 234(9 to 12), 238(3 to 9), 258(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 15.000000), (229: 60.000000), (234: 55.000000), (258: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 1), (206: 4), (210: 3), (211: 3), (229: 4), (234: 4), (238: 5), (258: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
