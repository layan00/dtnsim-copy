The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(10 to 6), 212(1 to 11), 218(1 to 6), 219(5 to 10), 236(4 to 1), 241(9 to 12), 249(3 to 9), 268(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 15.000000), (241: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 5), (212: 3), (218: 3), (219: 3), (236: 5), (241: 3), (249: 3), (268: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
