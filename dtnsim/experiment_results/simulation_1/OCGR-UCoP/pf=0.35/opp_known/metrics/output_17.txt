The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
801(10 to 6), 804(1 to 11), 810(1 to 6), 811(5 to 10), 827(4 to 1), 828(9 to 12), 840(3 to 9), 863(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(801: 55.000000), (804: 35.000000), (828: 55.000000), (840: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(801: 4), (804: 3), (810: 1), (811: 3), (827: 3), (828: 4), (840: 4), (863: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
