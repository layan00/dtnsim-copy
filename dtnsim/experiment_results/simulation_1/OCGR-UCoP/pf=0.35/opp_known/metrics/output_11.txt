The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
509(10 to 6), 513(1 to 11), 519(1 to 6), 520(5 to 10), 538(4 to 1), 543(9 to 12), 549(3 to 9), 573(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(509: 105.000000), (519: 15.000000), (520: 35.000000), (538: 60.000000), (543: 55.000000), (549: 15.000000), (573: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(509: 6), (513: 4), (519: 3), (520: 4), (538: 4), (543: 4), (549: 4), (573: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
