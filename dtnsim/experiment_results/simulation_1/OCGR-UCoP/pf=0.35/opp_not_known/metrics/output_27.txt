The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1065(10 to 6), 1082(1 to 11), 1087(1 to 6), 1088(5 to 10), 1119(4 to 1), 1120(9 to 12), 1145(3 to 9), 1182(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1082: 35.000000), (1087: 25.000000), (1088: 35.000000), (1120: 0.000000), (1145: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1065: 1), (1082: 3), (1087: 2), (1088: 3), (1119: 3), (1120: 3), (1145: 4), (1182: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 54 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
