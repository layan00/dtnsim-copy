The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
219(10 to 6), 235(1 to 11), 241(1 to 6), 242(5 to 10), 270(4 to 1), 271(9 to 12), 293(3 to 9), 326(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 55.000000), (293: 15.000000), (326: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(219: 4), (235: 2), (241: 1), (242: 4), (270: 5), (271: 4), (293: 4), (326: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
