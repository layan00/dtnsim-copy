The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1927(10 to 6), 1945(1 to 11), 1949(1 to 6), 1950(5 to 10), 1980(4 to 1), 1981(9 to 12), 2001(3 to 9), 2038(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1927: 105.000000), (1981: 0.000000), (2001: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1927: 5), (1945: 2), (1949: 2), (1950: 4), (1980: 4), (1981: 3), (2001: 4), (2038: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 104 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
