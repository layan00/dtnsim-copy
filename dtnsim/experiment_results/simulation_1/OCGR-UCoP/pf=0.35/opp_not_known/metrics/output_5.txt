The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(10 to 6), 236(1 to 11), 243(1 to 6), 244(5 to 10), 275(4 to 1), 276(9 to 12), 300(3 to 9), 333(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 55.000000), (236: 55.000000), (243: 25.000000), (276: 0.000000), (300: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 3), (236: 5), (243: 2), (244: 4), (275: 3), (276: 3), (300: 5), (333: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
