The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(10 to 6), 241(1 to 11), 250(1 to 6), 251(5 to 10), 282(4 to 1), 283(9 to 12), 308(3 to 9), 339(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 55.000000), (241: 35.000000), (250: 25.000000), (251: 35.000000), (283: 0.000000), (308: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 3), (241: 3), (250: 2), (251: 3), (282: 4), (283: 3), (308: 5), (339: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 91 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
