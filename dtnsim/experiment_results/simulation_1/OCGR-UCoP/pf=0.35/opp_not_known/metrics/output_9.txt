The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1938(10 to 6), 1954(1 to 11), 1957(1 to 6), 1958(5 to 10), 1989(4 to 1), 1991(9 to 12), 2016(3 to 9), 2046(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1957: 25.000000), (1958: 35.000000), (1991: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1938: 3), (1954: 2), (1957: 2), (1958: 7), (1989: 6), (1991: 3), (2016: 2), (2046: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 125 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
