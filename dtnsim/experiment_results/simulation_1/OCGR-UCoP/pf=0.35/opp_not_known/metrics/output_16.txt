The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
636(10 to 6), 651(1 to 11), 654(1 to 6), 655(5 to 10), 684(4 to 1), 685(9 to 12), 705(3 to 9), 738(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(684: 60.000000), (685: 55.000000), (705: 15.000000), (738: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 1), (651: 2), (654: 2), (655: 4), (684: 4), (685: 4), (705: 4), (738: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 84 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
