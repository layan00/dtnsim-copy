The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
663(10 to 6), 680(1 to 11), 685(1 to 6), 686(5 to 10), 714(4 to 1), 715(9 to 12), 736(3 to 9), 769(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(663: 105.000000), (686: 35.000000), (714: 60.000000), (715: 0.000000), (769: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(663: 5), (680: 2), (685: 1), (686: 3), (714: 4), (715: 3), (736: 2), (769: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
