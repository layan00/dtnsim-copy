The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
641(10 to 6), 657(1 to 11), 664(1 to 6), 665(5 to 10), 695(4 to 1), 697(9 to 12), 718(3 to 9), 748(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(665: 55.000000), (697: 0.000000), (718: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(641: 5), (657: 2), (664: 2), (665: 4), (695: 2), (697: 3), (718: 6), (748: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 132 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
