The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1087(10 to 6), 1104(1 to 11), 1108(1 to 6), 1109(5 to 10), 1138(4 to 1), 1142(9 to 12), 1163(3 to 9), 1193(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1108: 15.000000), (1138: 140.000000), (1142: 0.000000), (1193: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1087: 1), (1104: 2), (1108: 3), (1109: 4), (1138: 6), (1142: 3), (1163: 2), (1193: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 8 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
