The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1072(10 to 6), 1088(1 to 11), 1093(1 to 6), 1094(5 to 10), 1126(4 to 1), 1128(9 to 12), 1148(3 to 9), 1179(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1093: 25.000000), (1128: 0.000000), (1148: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1072: 1), (1088: 2), (1093: 2), (1094: 5), (1126: 6), (1128: 3), (1148: 6), (1179: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 111 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
