The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1515(10 to 6), 1531(1 to 11), 1536(1 to 6), 1537(5 to 10), 1567(4 to 1), 1572(9 to 12), 1593(3 to 9), 1627(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1536: 15.000000), (1572: 0.000000), (1593: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1515: 3), (1531: 3), (1536: 3), (1537: 4), (1567: 4), (1572: 3), (1593: 4), (1627: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 151 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
