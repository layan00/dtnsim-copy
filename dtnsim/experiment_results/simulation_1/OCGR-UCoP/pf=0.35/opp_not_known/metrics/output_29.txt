The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1922(10 to 6), 1937(1 to 11), 1943(1 to 6), 1944(5 to 10), 1973(4 to 1), 1977(9 to 12), 2001(3 to 9), 2037(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1937: 35.000000), (1943: 15.000000), (1944: 35.000000), (1977: 0.000000), (2001: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1922: 1), (1937: 3), (1943: 4), (1944: 3), (1973: 2), (1977: 3), (2001: 4), (2037: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
