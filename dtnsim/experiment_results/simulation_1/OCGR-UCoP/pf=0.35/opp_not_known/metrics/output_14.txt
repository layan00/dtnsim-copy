The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1941(10 to 6), 1957(1 to 11), 1962(1 to 6), 1963(5 to 10), 1992(4 to 1), 1993(9 to 12), 2017(3 to 9), 2048(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1957: 35.000000), (1962: 25.000000), (1963: 35.000000), (2048: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1941: 1), (1957: 3), (1962: 2), (1963: 3), (1992: 2), (1993: 4), (2017: 2), (2048: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
