The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1497(10 to 6), 1515(1 to 11), 1524(1 to 6), 1525(5 to 10), 1555(4 to 1), 1556(9 to 12), 1575(3 to 9), 1608(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1497: 55.000000), (1556: 0.000000), (1575: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1497: 3), (1515: 2), (1524: 2), (1525: 5), (1555: 4), (1556: 3), (1575: 5), (1608: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 150 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
