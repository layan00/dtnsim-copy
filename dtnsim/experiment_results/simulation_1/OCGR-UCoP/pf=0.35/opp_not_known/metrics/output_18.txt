The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1479(10 to 6), 1495(1 to 11), 1500(1 to 6), 1501(5 to 10), 1531(4 to 1), 1532(9 to 12), 1556(3 to 9), 1587(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1479: 55.000000), (1500: 25.000000), (1531: 60.000000), (1532: 0.000000), (1587: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1479: 3), (1495: 2), (1500: 2), (1501: 4), (1531: 4), (1532: 3), (1556: 5), (1587: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 88 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
