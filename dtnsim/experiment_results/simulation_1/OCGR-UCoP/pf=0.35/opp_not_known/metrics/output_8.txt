The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1508(10 to 6), 1526(1 to 11), 1534(1 to 6), 1535(5 to 10), 1565(4 to 1), 1566(9 to 12), 1589(3 to 9), 1620(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1526: 35.000000), (1535: 35.000000), (1565: 60.000000), (1566: 0.000000), (1589: 65.000000), (1620: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1508: 1), (1526: 3), (1534: 2), (1535: 3), (1565: 4), (1566: 3), (1589: 5), (1620: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 55 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
