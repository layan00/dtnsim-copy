The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1940(10 to 6), 1958(1 to 11), 1963(1 to 6), 1964(5 to 10), 1995(4 to 1), 1997(9 to 12), 2022(3 to 9), 2056(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1940: 105.000000), (1958: 35.000000), (1995: 60.000000), (1997: 55.000000), (2022: 15.000000), (2056: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1940: 5), (1958: 3), (1963: 2), (1964: 8), (1995: 4), (1997: 4), (2022: 4), (2056: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
