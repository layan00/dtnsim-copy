The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(10 to 6), 236(1 to 11), 242(1 to 6), 243(5 to 10), 272(4 to 1), 276(9 to 12), 296(3 to 9), 327(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 15.000000), (276: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 5), (236: 2), (242: 4), (243: 4), (272: 5), (276: 3), (296: 3), (327: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 162 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
