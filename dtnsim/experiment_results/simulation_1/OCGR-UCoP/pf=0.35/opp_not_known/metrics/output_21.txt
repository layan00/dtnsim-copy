The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
653(10 to 6), 668(1 to 11), 674(1 to 6), 675(5 to 10), 704(4 to 1), 706(9 to 12), 730(3 to 9), 761(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(653: 55.000000), (675: 35.000000), (706: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(653: 3), (668: 2), (674: 1), (675: 7), (704: 5), (706: 3), (730: 3), (761: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 88 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
