The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(10 to 6), 671(1 to 11), 677(1 to 6), 678(5 to 10), 708(4 to 1), 710(9 to 12), 734(3 to 9), 767(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(654: 55.000000), (678: 35.000000), (710: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 3), (671: 2), (677: 1), (678: 7), (708: 3), (710: 3), (734: 5), (767: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 6 calls to RUCoP, which took 47 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
