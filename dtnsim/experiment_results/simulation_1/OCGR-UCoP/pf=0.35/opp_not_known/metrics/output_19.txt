The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1903(10 to 6), 1918(1 to 11), 1924(1 to 6), 1925(5 to 10), 1955(4 to 1), 1956(9 to 12), 1982(3 to 9), 2012(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1918: 35.000000), (1924: 25.000000), (1925: 35.000000), (1955: 140.000000), (1956: 0.000000), (1982: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1903: 1), (1918: 3), (1924: 2), (1925: 3), (1955: 6), (1956: 3), (1982: 5), (2012: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 66 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
