The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1055(10 to 6), 1070(1 to 11), 1076(1 to 6), 1077(5 to 10), 1106(4 to 1), 1107(9 to 12), 1132(3 to 9), 1167(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1055: 55.000000), (1070: 35.000000), (1076: 25.000000), (1107: 55.000000), (1132: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1055: 3), (1070: 3), (1076: 2), (1077: 4), (1106: 3), (1107: 4), (1132: 4), (1167: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 96 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
