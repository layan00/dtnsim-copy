The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1494(10 to 6), 1509(1 to 11), 1516(1 to 6), 1517(5 to 10), 1545(4 to 1), 1550(9 to 12), 1570(3 to 9), 1606(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1516: 15.000000), (1517: 55.000000), (1550: 0.000000), (1570: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1494: 1), (1509: 3), (1516: 3), (1517: 5), (1545: 4), (1550: 3), (1570: 4), (1606: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 90 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
