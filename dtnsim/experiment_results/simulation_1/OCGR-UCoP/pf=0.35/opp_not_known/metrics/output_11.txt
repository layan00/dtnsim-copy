The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
640(10 to 6), 656(1 to 11), 662(1 to 6), 663(5 to 10), 691(4 to 1), 696(9 to 12), 714(3 to 9), 751(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(640: 105.000000), (662: 15.000000), (691: 60.000000), (696: 55.000000), (714: 15.000000), (751: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(640: 6), (656: 3), (662: 3), (663: 5), (691: 4), (696: 4), (714: 4), (751: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 115 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
