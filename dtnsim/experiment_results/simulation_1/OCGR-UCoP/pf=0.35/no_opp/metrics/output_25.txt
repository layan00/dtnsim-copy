The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
75(10 to 6), 79(1 to 11), 85(1 to 6), 86(5 to 10), 91(4 to 1), 92(9 to 12), 103(3 to 9), 108(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(85: 25.000000), (86: 55.000000), (108: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(75: 5), (79: 2), (85: 2), (86: 4), (91: 1), (92: 3), (103: 3), (108: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
