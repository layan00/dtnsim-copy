The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
574(10 to 6), 578(1 to 11), 581(1 to 6), 582(5 to 10), 587(4 to 1), 588(9 to 12), 598(3 to 9), 601(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(581: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(574: 3), (578: 2), (581: 2), (582: 1), (587: 1), (588: 3), (598: 2), (601: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 578: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

Node 2: 
Bundle 581: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 598: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000),
