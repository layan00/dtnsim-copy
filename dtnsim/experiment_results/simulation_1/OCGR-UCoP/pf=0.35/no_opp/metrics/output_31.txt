The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(10 to 6), 214(1 to 11), 219(1 to 6), 220(5 to 10), 224(4 to 1), 225(9 to 12), 233(3 to 9), 243(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 105.000000), (220: 35.000000), (224: 60.000000), (225: 55.000000), (243: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 5), (214: 2), (219: 1), (220: 3), (224: 4), (225: 4), (233: 2), (243: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 6 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
