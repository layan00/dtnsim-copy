The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
561(10 to 6), 564(1 to 11), 570(1 to 6), 571(5 to 10), 576(4 to 1), 578(9 to 12), 589(3 to 9), 599(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(564: 35.000000), (570: 25.000000), (571: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(561: 1), (564: 3), (570: 3), (571: 3), (576: 2), (578: 2), (589: 3), (599: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
