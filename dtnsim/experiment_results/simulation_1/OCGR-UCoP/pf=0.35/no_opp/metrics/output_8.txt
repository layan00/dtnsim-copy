The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
447(10 to 6), 453(1 to 11), 461(1 to 6), 462(5 to 10), 468(4 to 1), 469(9 to 12), 477(3 to 9), 484(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(453: 35.000000), (462: 35.000000), (468: 60.000000), (477: 65.000000), (484: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(447: 1), (453: 3), (461: 2), (462: 3), (468: 4), (469: 1), (477: 5), (484: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
