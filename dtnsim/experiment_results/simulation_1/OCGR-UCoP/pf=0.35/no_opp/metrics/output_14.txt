The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
571(10 to 6), 575(1 to 11), 580(1 to 6), 581(5 to 10), 586(4 to 1), 587(9 to 12), 598(3 to 9), 605(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(575: 35.000000), (580: 25.000000), (581: 35.000000), (605: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(571: 1), (575: 3), (580: 2), (581: 3), (586: 2), (587: 2), (598: 2), (605: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
