The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
418(10 to 6), 422(1 to 11), 427(1 to 6), 428(5 to 10), 432(4 to 1), 435(9 to 12), 443(3 to 9), 450(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(418: 45.000000), (427: 25.000000), (432: 60.000000), (450: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(418: 4), (422: 2), (427: 2), (428: 1), (432: 4), (435: 1), (443: 5), (450: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
