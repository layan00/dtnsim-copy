The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
538(10 to 6), 541(1 to 11), 547(1 to 6), 548(5 to 10), 554(4 to 1), 555(9 to 12), 568(3 to 9), 572(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(541: 35.000000), (547: 25.000000), (548: 35.000000), (568: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(538: 1), (541: 3), (547: 2), (548: 3), (554: 1), (555: 3), (568: 5), (572: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
