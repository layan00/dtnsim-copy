The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
313(10 to 6), 316(1 to 11), 320(1 to 6), 321(5 to 10), 328(4 to 1), 330(9 to 12), 342(3 to 9), 348(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(316: 35.000000), (320: 25.000000), (321: 35.000000), (342: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(313: 3), (316: 4), (320: 2), (321: 3), (328: 1), (330: 3), (342: 5), (348: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
