The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
339(10 to 6), 344(1 to 11), 348(1 to 6), 349(5 to 10), 352(4 to 1), 354(9 to 12), 361(3 to 9), 366(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(348: 25.000000), (361: 65.000000), (366: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(339: 1), (344: 2), (348: 3), (349: 1), (352: 1), (354: 1), (361: 5), (366: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
