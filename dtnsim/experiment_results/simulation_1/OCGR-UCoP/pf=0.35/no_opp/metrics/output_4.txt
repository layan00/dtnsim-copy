The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
573(10 to 6), 579(1 to 11), 584(1 to 6), 585(5 to 10), 590(4 to 1), 591(9 to 12), 602(3 to 9), 611(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(573: 105.000000), (579: 35.000000), (590: 60.000000), (591: 55.000000), (602: 65.000000), (611: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(573: 5), (579: 3), (584: 2), (585: 1), (590: 4), (591: 4), (602: 4), (611: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
