The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(10 to 6), 198(1 to 11), 205(1 to 6), 206(5 to 10), 212(4 to 1), 214(9 to 12), 221(3 to 9), 227(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 5), (198: 2), (205: 2), (206: 4), (212: 2), (214: 2), (221: 4), (227: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
