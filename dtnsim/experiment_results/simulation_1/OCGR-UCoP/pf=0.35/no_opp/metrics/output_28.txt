The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
441(10 to 6), 444(1 to 11), 451(1 to 6), 452(5 to 10), 457(4 to 1), 459(9 to 12), 464(3 to 9), 472(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(464: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(441: 1), (444: 3), (451: 2), (452: 2), (457: 4), (459: 1), (464: 4), (472: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
