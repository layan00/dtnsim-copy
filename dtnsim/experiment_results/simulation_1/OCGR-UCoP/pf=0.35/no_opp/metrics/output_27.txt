The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
314(10 to 6), 319(1 to 11), 324(1 to 6), 325(5 to 10), 332(4 to 1), 333(9 to 12), 344(3 to 9), 355(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(319: 35.000000), (324: 25.000000), (325: 35.000000), (344: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(314: 1), (319: 3), (324: 2), (325: 3), (332: 3), (333: 2), (344: 4), (355: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
