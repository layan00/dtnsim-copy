The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
334(10 to 6), 339(1 to 11), 343(1 to 6), 344(5 to 10), 347(4 to 1), 349(9 to 12), 356(3 to 9), 360(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(343: 25.000000), (360: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(334: 1), (339: 2), (343: 2), (344: 1), (347: 1), (349: 1), (356: 2), (360: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 5 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 339: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 343: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 339: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 343: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 356: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 347: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 344: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 360: (to: 1, time: 110.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 349: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 334: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 360: (to: 6, time: 110.000000), 
Node 13:
