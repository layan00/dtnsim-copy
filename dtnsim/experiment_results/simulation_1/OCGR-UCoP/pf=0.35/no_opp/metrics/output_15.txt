The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
71(10 to 6), 74(1 to 11), 78(1 to 6), 79(5 to 10), 83(4 to 1), 86(9 to 12), 89(3 to 9), 95(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(78: 65.000000), (83: 60.000000), (89: 65.000000), (95: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(71: 1), (74: 3), (78: 4), (79: 1), (83: 4), (86: 2), (89: 5), (95: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
