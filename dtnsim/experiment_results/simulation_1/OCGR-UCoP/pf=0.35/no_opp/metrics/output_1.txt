The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(10 to 6), 217(1 to 11), 222(1 to 6), 223(5 to 10), 228(4 to 1), 229(9 to 12), 238(3 to 9), 248(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 105.000000), (222: 25.000000), (223: 35.000000), (228: 60.000000), (229: 55.000000), (248: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 5), (217: 2), (222: 2), (223: 3), (228: 4), (229: 4), (238: 2), (248: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
