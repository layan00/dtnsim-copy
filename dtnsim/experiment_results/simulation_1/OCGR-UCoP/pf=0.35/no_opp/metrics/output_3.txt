The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
456(10 to 6), 460(1 to 11), 465(1 to 6), 466(5 to 10), 471(4 to 1), 473(9 to 12), 480(3 to 9), 486(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(465: 25.000000), (480: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(456: 3), (460: 3), (465: 2), (466: 1), (471: 1), (473: 1), (480: 4), (486: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 460: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
