The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
442(10 to 6), 449(1 to 11), 456(1 to 6), 457(5 to 10), 461(4 to 1), 463(9 to 12), 475(3 to 9), 485(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(442: 55.000000), (456: 25.000000), (463: 55.000000), (475: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(442: 4), (449: 3), (456: 3), (457: 2), (461: 4), (463: 4), (475: 4), (485: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
