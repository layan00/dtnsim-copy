The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
300(10 to 6), 303(1 to 11), 309(1 to 6), 310(5 to 10), 313(4 to 1), 314(9 to 12), 325(3 to 9), 334(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(300: 55.000000), (303: 35.000000), (309: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(300: 4), (303: 3), (309: 2), (310: 1), (313: 3), (314: 1), (325: 4), (334: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
