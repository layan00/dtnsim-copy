The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
430(10 to 6), 436(1 to 11), 445(1 to 6), 446(5 to 10), 452(4 to 1), 455(9 to 12), 460(3 to 9), 465(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(430: 45.000000), (460: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(430: 4), (436: 2), (445: 2), (446: 2), (452: 1), (455: 3), (460: 5), (465: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
