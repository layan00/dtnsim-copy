The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
187(10 to 6), 191(1 to 11), 197(1 to 6), 198(5 to 10), 202(4 to 1), 205(9 to 12), 210(3 to 9), 219(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(187: 105.000000), (197: 25.000000), (202: 60.000000), (210: 65.000000), (219: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(187: 6), (191: 3), (197: 3), (198: 2), (202: 4), (205: 1), (210: 4), (219: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
