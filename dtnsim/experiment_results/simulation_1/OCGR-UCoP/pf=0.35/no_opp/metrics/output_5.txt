The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
76(10 to 6), 80(1 to 11), 87(1 to 6), 88(5 to 10), 93(4 to 1), 96(9 to 12), 104(3 to 9), 111(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(76: 45.000000), (87: 25.000000), (104: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(76: 4), (80: 3), (87: 2), (88: 1), (93: 3), (96: 1), (104: 5), (111: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
