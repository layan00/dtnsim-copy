The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(10 to 6), 87(1 to 11), 94(1 to 6), 95(5 to 10), 102(4 to 1), 103(9 to 12), 114(3 to 9), 122(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(87: 35.000000), (94: 25.000000), (95: 35.000000), (114: 65.000000), (122: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 1), (87: 3), (94: 2), (95: 3), (102: 1), (103: 2), (114: 4), (122: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 66 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
