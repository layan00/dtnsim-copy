The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
316(10 to 6), 320(1 to 11), 325(1 to 6), 326(5 to 10), 332(4 to 1), 333(9 to 12), 339(3 to 9), 344(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(325: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(316: 1), (320: 2), (325: 2), (326: 1), (332: 1), (333: 2), (339: 4), (344: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 320: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 325: (to: 2, time: 30.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 325: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 320: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 339: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 332: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 326: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Bundle 339: (to: 12, time: 110.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 339: (to: 5, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8:
