The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(10 to 6), 209(1 to 11), 215(1 to 6), 216(5 to 10), 219(4 to 1), 221(9 to 12), 229(3 to 9), 233(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 105.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 5), (209: 2), (215: 2), (216: 1), (219: 1), (221: 3), (229: 3), (233: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 209: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
