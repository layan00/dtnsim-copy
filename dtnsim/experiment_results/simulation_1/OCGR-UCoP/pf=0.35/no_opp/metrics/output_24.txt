The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
556(10 to 6), 562(1 to 11), 566(1 to 6), 567(5 to 10), 571(4 to 1), 572(9 to 12), 577(3 to 9), 588(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(556: 105.000000), (577: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(556: 5), (562: 2), (566: 2), (567: 1), (571: 4), (572: 1), (577: 4), (588: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
