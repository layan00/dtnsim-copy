The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
76(1 to 6), 77(6 to 10), 78(9 to 4), 80(2 to 8), 81(5 to 12), 85(7 to 12), 86(10 to 9), 87(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(76: 2), (77: 5), (78: 4), (80: 2), (81: 2), (85: 2), (86: 2), (87: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 76: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
