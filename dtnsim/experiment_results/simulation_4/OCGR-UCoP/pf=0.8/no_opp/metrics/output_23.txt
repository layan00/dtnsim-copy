The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
427(1 to 6), 428(6 to 10), 429(9 to 4), 431(2 to 8), 434(5 to 12), 438(7 to 12), 439(10 to 9), 444(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(427: 1), (428: 3), (429: 3), (431: 3), (434: 2), (438: 2), (439: 3), (444: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
