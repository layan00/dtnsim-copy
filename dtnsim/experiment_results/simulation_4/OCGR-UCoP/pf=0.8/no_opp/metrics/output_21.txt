The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(1 to 6), 212(6 to 10), 213(9 to 4), 214(2 to 8), 216(5 to 12), 220(7 to 12), 221(10 to 9), 223(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(211: 1), (212: 3), (213: 4), (214: 2), (216: 2), (220: 2), (221: 2), (223: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 211: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
