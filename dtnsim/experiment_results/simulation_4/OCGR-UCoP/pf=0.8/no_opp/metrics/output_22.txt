The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
317(1 to 6), 318(6 to 10), 319(9 to 4), 320(2 to 8), 322(5 to 12), 326(7 to 12), 327(10 to 9), 329(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(320: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(317: 1), (318: 5), (319: 4), (320: 3), (322: 3), (326: 2), (327: 2), (329: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
