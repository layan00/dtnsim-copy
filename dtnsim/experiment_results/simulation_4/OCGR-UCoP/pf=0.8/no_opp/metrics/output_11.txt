The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
177(1 to 6), 178(6 to 10), 179(9 to 4), 180(2 to 8), 181(5 to 12), 182(7 to 12), 183(10 to 9), 184(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(177: 1), (178: 5), (179: 4), (180: 2), (181: 2), (182: 3), (183: 3), (184: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
