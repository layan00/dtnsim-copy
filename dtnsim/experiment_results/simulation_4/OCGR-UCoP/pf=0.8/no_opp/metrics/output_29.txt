The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
502(1 to 6), 503(6 to 10), 504(9 to 4), 506(2 to 8), 513(5 to 12), 516(7 to 12), 517(10 to 9), 519(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(506: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(502: 3), (503: 5), (504: 5), (506: 2), (513: 2), (516: 2), (517: 3), (519: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
