The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
282(1 to 6), 283(6 to 10), 284(9 to 4), 285(2 to 8), 287(5 to 12), 290(7 to 12), 291(10 to 9), 292(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(282: 1), (283: 6), (284: 4), (285: 2), (287: 2), (290: 3), (291: 2), (292: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
