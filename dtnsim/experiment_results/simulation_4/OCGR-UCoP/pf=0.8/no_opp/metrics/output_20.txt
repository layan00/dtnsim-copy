The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
89(1 to 6), 90(6 to 10), 91(9 to 4), 94(2 to 8), 97(5 to 12), 102(7 to 12), 103(10 to 9), 107(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(91: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(89: 1), (90: 8), (91: 6), (94: 6), (97: 2), (102: 2), (103: 5), (107: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
