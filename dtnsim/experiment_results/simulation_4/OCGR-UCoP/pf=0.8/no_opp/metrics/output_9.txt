The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
515(1 to 6), 516(6 to 10), 517(9 to 4), 518(2 to 8), 522(5 to 12), 525(7 to 12), 526(10 to 9), 528(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(515: 1), (516: 5), (517: 5), (518: 2), (522: 2), (525: 2), (526: 2), (528: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
