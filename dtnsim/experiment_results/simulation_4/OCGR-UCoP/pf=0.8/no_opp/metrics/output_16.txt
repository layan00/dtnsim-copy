The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
192(1 to 6), 193(6 to 10), 194(9 to 4), 195(2 to 8), 196(5 to 12), 198(7 to 12), 199(10 to 9), 201(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(192: 1), (193: 5), (194: 4), (195: 2), (196: 2), (198: 2), (199: 2), (201: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
