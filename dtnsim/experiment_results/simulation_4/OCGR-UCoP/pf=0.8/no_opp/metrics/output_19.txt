The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
483(1 to 6), 484(6 to 10), 485(9 to 4), 486(2 to 8), 487(5 to 12), 490(7 to 12), 491(10 to 9), 493(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(483: 1), (484: 5), (485: 5), (486: 2), (487: 2), (490: 3), (491: 2), (493: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
