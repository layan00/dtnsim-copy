The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 6), 199(6 to 10), 200(9 to 4), 203(2 to 8), 207(5 to 12), 211(7 to 12), 212(10 to 9), 214(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 1), (199: 6), (200: 4), (203: 3), (207: 2), (211: 2), (212: 2), (214: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
