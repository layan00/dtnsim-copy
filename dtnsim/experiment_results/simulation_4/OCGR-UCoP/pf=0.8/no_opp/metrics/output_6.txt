The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(1 to 6), 201(6 to 10), 202(9 to 4), 204(2 to 8), 210(5 to 12), 214(7 to 12), 215(10 to 9), 218(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 3), (201: 3), (202: 4), (204: 3), (210: 3), (214: 3), (215: 2), (218: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
