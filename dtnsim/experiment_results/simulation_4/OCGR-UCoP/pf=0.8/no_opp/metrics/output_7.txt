The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
309(1 to 6), 310(6 to 10), 311(9 to 4), 312(2 to 8), 314(5 to 12), 317(7 to 12), 318(10 to 9), 319(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(309: 1), (310: 3), (311: 4), (312: 2), (314: 2), (317: 2), (318: 2), (319: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 309: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
