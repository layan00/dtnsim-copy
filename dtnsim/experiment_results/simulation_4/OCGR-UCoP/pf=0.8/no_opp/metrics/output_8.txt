The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
411(1 to 6), 412(6 to 10), 413(9 to 4), 415(2 to 8), 416(5 to 12), 420(7 to 12), 421(10 to 9), 424(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(411: 2), (412: 5), (413: 4), (415: 2), (416: 2), (420: 2), (421: 3), (424: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
