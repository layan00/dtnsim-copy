The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
383(1 to 6), 384(6 to 10), 385(9 to 4), 386(2 to 8), 389(5 to 12), 394(7 to 12), 395(10 to 9), 397(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(383: 1), (384: 5), (385: 4), (386: 2), (389: 2), (394: 2), (395: 2), (397: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
