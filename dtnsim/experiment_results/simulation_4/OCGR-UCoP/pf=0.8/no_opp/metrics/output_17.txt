The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
281(1 to 6), 282(6 to 10), 283(9 to 4), 284(2 to 8), 286(5 to 12), 288(7 to 12), 289(10 to 9), 291(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(281: 1), (282: 6), (283: 4), (284: 2), (286: 2), (288: 2), (289: 2), (291: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
