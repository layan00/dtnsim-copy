The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
392(1 to 6), 393(6 to 10), 394(9 to 4), 395(2 to 8), 397(5 to 12), 399(7 to 12), 400(10 to 9), 401(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(392: 1), (393: 5), (394: 5), (395: 2), (397: 3), (399: 2), (400: 2), (401: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
