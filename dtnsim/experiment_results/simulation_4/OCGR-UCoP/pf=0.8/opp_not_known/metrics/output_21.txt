The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
653(1 to 6), 654(6 to 10), 655(9 to 4), 660(2 to 8), 674(5 to 12), 702(7 to 12), 703(10 to 9), 709(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(653: 1), (654: 6), (655: 5), (660: 2), (674: 2), (702: 4), (703: 3), (709: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
