The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(1 to 6), 223(6 to 10), 224(9 to 4), 229(2 to 8), 242(5 to 12), 268(7 to 12), 269(10 to 9), 270(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 1), (223: 5), (224: 5), (229: 2), (242: 2), (268: 3), (269: 2), (270: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
