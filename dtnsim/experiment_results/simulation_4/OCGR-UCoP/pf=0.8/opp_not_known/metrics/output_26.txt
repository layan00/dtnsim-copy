The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
625(1 to 6), 626(6 to 10), 627(9 to 4), 632(2 to 8), 648(5 to 12), 677(7 to 12), 678(10 to 9), 688(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(678: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(625: 1), (626: 6), (627: 5), (632: 2), (648: 2), (677: 4), (678: 7), (688: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 74 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
