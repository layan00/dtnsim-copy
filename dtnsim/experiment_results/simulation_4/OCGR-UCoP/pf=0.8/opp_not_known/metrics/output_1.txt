The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
657(1 to 6), 658(6 to 10), 659(9 to 4), 666(2 to 8), 682(5 to 12), 710(7 to 12), 711(10 to 9), 719(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(659: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(657: 1), (658: 6), (659: 4), (666: 3), (682: 2), (710: 3), (711: 7), (719: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 93 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
