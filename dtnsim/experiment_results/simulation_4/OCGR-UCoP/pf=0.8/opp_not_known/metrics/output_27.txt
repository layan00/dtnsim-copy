The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1042(1 to 6), 1043(6 to 10), 1044(9 to 4), 1049(2 to 8), 1064(5 to 12), 1091(7 to 12), 1092(10 to 9), 1093(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1044: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1042: 1), (1043: 7), (1044: 4), (1049: 2), (1064: 2), (1091: 2), (1092: 3), (1093: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
