The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
230(1 to 6), 231(6 to 10), 232(9 to 4), 241(2 to 8), 261(5 to 12), 287(7 to 12), 288(10 to 9), 289(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(232: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(230: 3), (231: 9), (232: 4), (241: 3), (261: 3), (287: 2), (288: 4), (289: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 67 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
