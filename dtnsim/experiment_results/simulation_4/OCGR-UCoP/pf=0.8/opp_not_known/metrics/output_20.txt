The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
233(1 to 6), 234(6 to 10), 235(9 to 4), 242(2 to 8), 257(5 to 12), 286(7 to 12), 287(10 to 9), 291(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(233: 1), (234: 8), (235: 4), (242: 6), (257: 2), (286: 2), (287: 5), (291: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 90 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
