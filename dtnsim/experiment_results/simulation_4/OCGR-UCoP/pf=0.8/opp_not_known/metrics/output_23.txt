The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1484(1 to 6), 1485(6 to 10), 1486(9 to 4), 1492(2 to 8), 1507(5 to 12), 1535(7 to 12), 1536(10 to 9), 1541(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1486: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1484: 1), (1485: 5), (1486: 5), (1492: 3), (1507: 2), (1535: 2), (1536: 3), (1541: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 95 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
