The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1872(1 to 6), 1873(6 to 10), 1874(9 to 4), 1880(2 to 8), 1897(5 to 12), 1924(7 to 12), 1925(10 to 9), 1927(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1874: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1872: 3), (1873: 8), (1874: 4), (1880: 3), (1897: 2), (1924: 2), (1925: 2), (1927: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
