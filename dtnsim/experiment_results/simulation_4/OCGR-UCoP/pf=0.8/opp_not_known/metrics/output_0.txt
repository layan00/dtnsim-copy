The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(1 to 6), 229(6 to 10), 230(9 to 4), 236(2 to 8), 249(5 to 12), 278(7 to 12), 279(10 to 9), 288(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(230: 80.000000), (278: 0.000000), (288: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 1), (229: 6), (230: 4), (236: 3), (249: 2), (278: 6), (279: 3), (288: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
