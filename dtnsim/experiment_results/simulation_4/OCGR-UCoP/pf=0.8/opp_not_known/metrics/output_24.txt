The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1900(1 to 6), 1901(6 to 10), 1902(9 to 4), 1909(2 to 8), 1924(5 to 12), 1951(7 to 12), 1952(10 to 9), 1960(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1902: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1900: 2), (1901: 6), (1902: 4), (1909: 2), (1924: 2), (1951: 3), (1952: 7), (1960: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 99 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
