The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1038(1 to 6), 1039(6 to 10), 1040(9 to 4), 1045(2 to 8), 1059(5 to 12), 1086(7 to 12), 1087(10 to 9), 1095(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1040: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1038: 1), (1039: 6), (1040: 4), (1045: 2), (1059: 2), (1086: 3), (1087: 8), (1095: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 68 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
