The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1464(1 to 6), 1465(6 to 10), 1466(9 to 4), 1471(2 to 8), 1485(5 to 12), 1511(7 to 12), 1512(10 to 9), 1513(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1464: 1), (1465: 7), (1466: 5), (1471: 2), (1485: 3), (1511: 2), (1512: 2), (1513: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 133 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
