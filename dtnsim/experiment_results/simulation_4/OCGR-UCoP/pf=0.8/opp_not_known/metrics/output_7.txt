The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1062(1 to 6), 1063(6 to 10), 1064(9 to 4), 1069(2 to 8), 1083(5 to 12), 1110(7 to 12), 1111(10 to 9), 1112(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1062: 1), (1063: 6), (1064: 5), (1069: 2), (1083: 2), (1110: 2), (1111: 2), (1112: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
