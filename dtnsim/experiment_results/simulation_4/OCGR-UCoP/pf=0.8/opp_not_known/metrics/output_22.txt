The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1066(1 to 6), 1067(6 to 10), 1068(9 to 4), 1073(2 to 8), 1087(5 to 12), 1115(7 to 12), 1116(10 to 9), 1118(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1068: 120.000000), (1073: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1066: 1), (1067: 9), (1068: 5), (1073: 3), (1087: 3), (1115: 2), (1116: 2), (1118: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
