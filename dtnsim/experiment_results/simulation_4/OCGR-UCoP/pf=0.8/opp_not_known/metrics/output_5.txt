The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
229(1 to 6), 230(6 to 10), 231(9 to 4), 236(2 to 8), 251(5 to 12), 279(7 to 12), 280(10 to 9), 283(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(280: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(229: 1), (230: 6), (231: 5), (236: 3), (251: 2), (279: 2), (280: 5), (283: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 140 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
