The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1878(1 to 6), 1879(6 to 10), 1880(9 to 4), 1885(2 to 8), 1901(5 to 12), 1928(7 to 12), 1929(10 to 9), 1931(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1880: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1878: 1), (1879: 7), (1880: 5), (1885: 2), (1901: 2), (1928: 2), (1929: 2), (1931: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 100 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
