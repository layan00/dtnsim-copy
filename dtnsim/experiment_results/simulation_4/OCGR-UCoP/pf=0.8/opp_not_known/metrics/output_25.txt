The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 6), 221(6 to 10), 222(9 to 4), 228(2 to 8), 241(5 to 12), 269(7 to 12), 270(10 to 9), 278(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 3), (221: 6), (222: 5), (228: 3), (241: 2), (269: 3), (270: 7), (278: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 132 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
