The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1852(1 to 6), 1853(6 to 10), 1854(9 to 4), 1859(2 to 8), 1872(5 to 12), 1899(7 to 12), 1900(10 to 9), 1902(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1852: 1), (1853: 7), (1854: 5), (1859: 2), (1872: 2), (1899: 3), (1900: 2), (1902: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 117 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
