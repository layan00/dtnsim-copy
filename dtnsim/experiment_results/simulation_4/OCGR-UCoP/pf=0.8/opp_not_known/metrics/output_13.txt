The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1453(1 to 6), 1454(6 to 10), 1455(9 to 4), 1461(2 to 8), 1475(5 to 12), 1502(7 to 12), 1503(10 to 9), 1504(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1455: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1453: 1), (1454: 6), (1455: 4), (1461: 2), (1475: 4), (1502: 2), (1503: 2), (1504: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 87 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
