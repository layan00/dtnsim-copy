The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1068(1 to 6), 1069(6 to 10), 1070(9 to 4), 1075(2 to 8), 1088(5 to 12), 1114(7 to 12), 1115(10 to 9), 1117(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1068: 1), (1069: 6), (1070: 5), (1075: 2), (1088: 2), (1114: 2), (1115: 2), (1117: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 104 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
