The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1459(1 to 6), 1460(6 to 10), 1461(9 to 4), 1467(2 to 8), 1483(5 to 12), 1512(7 to 12), 1513(10 to 9), 1515(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1461: 0.000000), (1515: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1459: 1), (1460: 6), (1461: 3), (1467: 2), (1483: 2), (1512: 2), (1513: 2), (1515: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 71 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
