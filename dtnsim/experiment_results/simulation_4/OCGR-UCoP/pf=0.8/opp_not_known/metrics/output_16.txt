The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
640(1 to 6), 641(6 to 10), 642(9 to 4), 647(2 to 8), 660(5 to 12), 686(7 to 12), 687(10 to 9), 689(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(640: 1), (641: 6), (642: 5), (647: 2), (660: 2), (686: 2), (687: 2), (689: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
