The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 6), 218(6 to 10), 219(9 to 4), 224(2 to 8), 228(5 to 12), 244(7 to 12), 245(10 to 9), 252(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(217: 40.000000), (245: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 3), (218: 4), (219: 5), (224: 3), (228: 2), (244: 4), (245: 5), (252: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
