The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
519(1 to 6), 520(6 to 10), 521(9 to 4), 526(2 to 8), 529(5 to 12), 545(7 to 12), 546(10 to 9), 553(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(519: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(519: 3), (520: 4), (521: 5), (526: 2), (529: 2), (545: 6), (546: 2), (553: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
