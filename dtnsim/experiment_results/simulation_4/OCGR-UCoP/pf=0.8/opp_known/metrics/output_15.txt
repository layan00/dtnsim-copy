The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 6), 219(6 to 10), 220(9 to 4), 228(2 to 8), 235(5 to 12), 249(7 to 12), 250(10 to 9), 255(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 40.000000), (220: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 3), (219: 8), (220: 4), (228: 3), (235: 3), (249: 4), (250: 5), (255: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
