The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
510(1 to 6), 511(6 to 10), 512(9 to 4), 517(2 to 8), 518(5 to 12), 532(7 to 12), 533(10 to 9), 537(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(510: 3), (511: 4), (512: 5), (517: 2), (518: 2), (532: 4), (533: 2), (537: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
