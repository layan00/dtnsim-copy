The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
782(1 to 6), 783(6 to 10), 784(9 to 4), 789(2 to 8), 792(5 to 12), 807(7 to 12), 808(10 to 9), 811(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(784: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(782: 3), (783: 4), (784: 4), (789: 2), (792: 2), (807: 4), (808: 3), (811: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
