The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(1 to 6), 222(6 to 10), 223(9 to 4), 230(2 to 8), 233(5 to 12), 250(7 to 12), 251(10 to 9), 256(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 3), (222: 6), (223: 4), (230: 3), (233: 2), (250: 4), (251: 4), (256: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
