The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
488(1 to 6), 489(6 to 10), 490(9 to 4), 495(2 to 8), 499(5 to 12), 516(7 to 12), 517(10 to 9), 521(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(488: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(488: 4), (489: 6), (490: 5), (495: 2), (499: 2), (516: 5), (517: 2), (521: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
