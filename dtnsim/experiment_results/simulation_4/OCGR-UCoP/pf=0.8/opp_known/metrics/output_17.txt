The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
786(1 to 6), 787(6 to 10), 788(9 to 4), 793(2 to 8), 795(5 to 12), 809(7 to 12), 810(10 to 9), 814(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(788: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(786: 3), (787: 4), (788: 4), (793: 2), (795: 2), (809: 4), (810: 2), (814: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
