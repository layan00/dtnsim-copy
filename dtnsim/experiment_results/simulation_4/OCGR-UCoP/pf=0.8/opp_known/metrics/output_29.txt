The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1385(1 to 6), 1386(6 to 10), 1387(9 to 4), 1392(2 to 8), 1398(5 to 12), 1413(7 to 12), 1414(10 to 9), 1418(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1392: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1385: 3), (1386: 7), (1387: 5), (1392: 2), (1398: 2), (1413: 4), (1414: 3), (1418: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
