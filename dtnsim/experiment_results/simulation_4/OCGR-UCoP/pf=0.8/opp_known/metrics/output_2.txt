The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
817(1 to 6), 818(6 to 10), 819(9 to 4), 824(2 to 8), 825(5 to 12), 839(7 to 12), 840(10 to 9), 843(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(817: 3), (818: 4), (819: 5), (824: 2), (825: 2), (839: 4), (840: 2), (843: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
