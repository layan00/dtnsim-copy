The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1099(1 to 6), 1100(6 to 10), 1101(9 to 4), 1106(2 to 8), 1107(5 to 12), 1123(7 to 12), 1124(10 to 9), 1130(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1101: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1099: 3), (1100: 4), (1101: 5), (1106: 2), (1107: 2), (1123: 6), (1124: 4), (1130: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
