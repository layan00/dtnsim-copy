The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
808(1 to 6), 809(6 to 10), 810(9 to 4), 815(2 to 8), 817(5 to 12), 832(7 to 12), 833(10 to 9), 836(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(808: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(808: 4), (809: 4), (810: 5), (815: 2), (817: 2), (832: 4), (833: 2), (836: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
