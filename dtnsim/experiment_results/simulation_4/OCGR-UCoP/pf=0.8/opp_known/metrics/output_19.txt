The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1365(1 to 6), 1366(6 to 10), 1367(9 to 4), 1372(2 to 8), 1373(5 to 12), 1388(7 to 12), 1389(10 to 9), 1393(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1365: 3), (1366: 4), (1367: 5), (1372: 2), (1373: 2), (1388: 4), (1389: 2), (1393: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
