The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1384(1 to 6), 1385(6 to 10), 1386(9 to 4), 1391(2 to 8), 1395(5 to 12), 1410(7 to 12), 1411(10 to 9), 1415(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1386: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1384: 3), (1385: 4), (1386: 4), (1391: 3), (1395: 2), (1410: 4), (1411: 2), (1415: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
