The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(1 to 6), 209(6 to 10), 210(9 to 4), 215(2 to 8), 216(5 to 12), 232(7 to 12), 233(10 to 9), 236(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 3), (209: 4), (210: 5), (215: 2), (216: 2), (232: 4), (233: 2), (236: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
