The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
494(1 to 6), 495(6 to 10), 496(9 to 4), 501(2 to 8), 502(5 to 12), 515(7 to 12), 516(10 to 9), 519(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(494: 3), (495: 4), (496: 4), (501: 2), (502: 2), (515: 4), (516: 3), (519: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
