The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1416(1 to 6), 1417(6 to 10), 1418(9 to 4), 1424(2 to 8), 1427(5 to 12), 1442(7 to 12), 1443(10 to 9), 1448(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1416: 80.000000), (1418: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1416: 4), (1417: 8), (1418: 4), (1424: 2), (1427: 2), (1442: 4), (1443: 2), (1448: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
