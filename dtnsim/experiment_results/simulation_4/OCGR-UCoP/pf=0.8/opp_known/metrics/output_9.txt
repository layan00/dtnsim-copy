The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1389(1 to 6), 1390(6 to 10), 1391(9 to 4), 1396(2 to 8), 1400(5 to 12), 1415(7 to 12), 1416(10 to 9), 1419(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1389: 80.000000), (1390: 120.000000), (1391: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1389: 4), (1390: 9), (1391: 5), (1396: 2), (1400: 2), (1415: 4), (1416: 2), (1419: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
