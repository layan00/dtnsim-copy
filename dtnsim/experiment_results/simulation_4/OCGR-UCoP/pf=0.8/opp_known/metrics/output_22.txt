The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
813(1 to 6), 814(6 to 10), 815(9 to 4), 820(2 to 8), 822(5 to 12), 838(7 to 12), 839(10 to 9), 844(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(815: 120.000000), (820: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(813: 3), (814: 4), (815: 5), (820: 3), (822: 3), (838: 6), (839: 2), (844: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
