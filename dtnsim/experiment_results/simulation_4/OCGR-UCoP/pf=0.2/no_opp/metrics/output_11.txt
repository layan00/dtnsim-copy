The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
298(1 to 6), 299(6 to 10), 300(9 to 4), 303(2 to 8), 310(5 to 12), 316(7 to 12), 317(10 to 9), 318(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(310: 95.000000), (316: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(298: 1), (299: 2), (300: 7), (303: 2), (310: 4), (316: 4), (317: 3), (318: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
