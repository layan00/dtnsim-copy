The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
869(1 to 6), 870(6 to 10), 871(9 to 4), 874(2 to 8), 886(5 to 12), 894(7 to 12), 895(10 to 9), 899(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(874: 0.000000), (886: 95.000000), (894: 80.000000), (895: 40.000000), (899: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(869: 1), (870: 2), (871: 8), (874: 2), (886: 4), (894: 4), (895: 4), (899: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
