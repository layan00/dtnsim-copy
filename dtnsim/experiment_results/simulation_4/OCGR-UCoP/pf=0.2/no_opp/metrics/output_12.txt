The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
472(1 to 6), 473(6 to 10), 474(9 to 4), 476(2 to 8), 483(5 to 12), 490(7 to 12), 491(10 to 9), 497(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(476: 25.000000), (483: 95.000000), (490: 80.000000), (491: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(472: 1), (473: 2), (474: 3), (476: 3), (483: 5), (490: 3), (491: 4), (497: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
