The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
122(1 to 6), 123(6 to 10), 124(9 to 4), 129(2 to 8), 140(5 to 12), 147(7 to 12), 148(10 to 9), 151(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(124: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(122: 3), (123: 4), (124: 6), (129: 3), (140: 3), (147: 3), (148: 2), (151: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
