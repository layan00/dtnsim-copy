The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
626(1 to 6), 627(6 to 10), 628(9 to 4), 634(2 to 8), 643(5 to 12), 664(7 to 12), 665(10 to 9), 672(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(626: 80.000000), (627: 80.000000), (628: 0.000000), (634: 0.000000), (665: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(626: 4), (627: 8), (628: 3), (634: 2), (643: 2), (664: 5), (665: 5), (672: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
