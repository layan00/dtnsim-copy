The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1030(1 to 6), 1031(6 to 10), 1032(9 to 4), 1044(2 to 8), 1051(5 to 12), 1070(7 to 12), 1071(10 to 9), 1080(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1031: 0.000000), (1032: 0.000000), (1044: 25.000000), (1051: 95.000000), (1070: 0.000000), (1080: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1030: 3), (1031: 8), (1032: 3), (1044: 3), (1051: 4), (1070: 6), (1071: 2), (1080: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
