The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
646(1 to 6), 647(6 to 10), 648(9 to 4), 657(2 to 8), 666(5 to 12), 687(7 to 12), 688(10 to 9), 704(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(646: 40.000000), (647: 40.000000), (648: 0.000000), (657: 25.000000), (687: 0.000000), (688: 40.000000), (704: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(646: 3), (647: 8), (648: 3), (657: 6), (666: 4), (687: 6), (688: 5), (704: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
