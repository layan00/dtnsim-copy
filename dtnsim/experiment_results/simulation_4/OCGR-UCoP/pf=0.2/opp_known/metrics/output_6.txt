The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
639(1 to 6), 640(6 to 10), 641(9 to 4), 647(2 to 8), 658(5 to 12), 679(7 to 12), 680(10 to 9), 692(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(639: 40.000000), (640: 80.000000), (641: 0.000000), (647: 0.000000), (658: 95.000000), (679: 0.000000), (680: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(639: 3), (640: 8), (641: 3), (647: 2), (658: 5), (679: 6), (680: 5), (692: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
