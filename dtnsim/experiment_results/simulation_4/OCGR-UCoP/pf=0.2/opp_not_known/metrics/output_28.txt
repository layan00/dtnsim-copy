The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1788(1 to 6), 1789(6 to 10), 1790(9 to 4), 1802(2 to 8), 1822(5 to 12), 1855(7 to 12), 1856(10 to 9), 1862(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1788: 40.000000), (1789: 0.000000), (1790: 0.000000), (1802: 0.000000), (1856: 40.000000), (1862: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1788: 3), (1789: 8), (1790: 3), (1802: 2), (1822: 3), (1855: 2), (1856: 4), (1862: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 47 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
