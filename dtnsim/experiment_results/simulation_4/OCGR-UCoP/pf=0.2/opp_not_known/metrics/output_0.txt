The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
273(1 to 6), 274(6 to 10), 275(9 to 4), 287(2 to 8), 310(5 to 12), 343(7 to 12), 344(10 to 9), 355(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(273: 40.000000), (274: 0.000000), (275: 0.000000), (287: 0.000000), (310: 95.000000), (343: 0.000000), (355: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(273: 3), (274: 8), (275: 3), (287: 2), (310: 4), (343: 6), (344: 3), (355: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 83 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
