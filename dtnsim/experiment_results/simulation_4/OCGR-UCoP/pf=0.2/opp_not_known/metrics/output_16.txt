The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
752(1 to 6), 753(6 to 10), 754(9 to 4), 760(2 to 8), 781(5 to 12), 814(7 to 12), 815(10 to 9), 826(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(754: 0.000000), (760: 0.000000), (815: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(752: 2), (753: 7), (754: 3), (760: 2), (781: 2), (814: 4), (815: 7), (826: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 66 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
