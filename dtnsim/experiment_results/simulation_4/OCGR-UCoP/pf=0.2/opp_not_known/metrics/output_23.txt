The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1781(1 to 6), 1782(6 to 10), 1783(9 to 4), 1794(2 to 8), 1813(5 to 12), 1847(7 to 12), 1848(10 to 9), 1859(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1781: 40.000000), (1782: 0.000000), (1783: 80.000000), (1794: 0.000000), (1848: 40.000000), (1859: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1781: 3), (1782: 8), (1783: 4), (1794: 2), (1813: 2), (1847: 3), (1848: 7), (1859: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 68 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
