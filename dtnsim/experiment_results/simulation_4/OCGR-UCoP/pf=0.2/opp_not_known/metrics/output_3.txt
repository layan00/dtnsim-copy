The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1780(1 to 6), 1781(6 to 10), 1782(9 to 4), 1794(2 to 8), 1814(5 to 12), 1847(7 to 12), 1848(10 to 9), 1862(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1780: 40.000000), (1781: 0.000000), (1782: 0.000000), (1794: 0.000000), (1814: 95.000000), (1847: 0.000000), (1848: 100.000000), (1862: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1780: 3), (1781: 8), (1782: 3), (1794: 2), (1814: 4), (1847: 6), (1848: 8), (1862: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 6 calls to RUCoP, which took 39 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
