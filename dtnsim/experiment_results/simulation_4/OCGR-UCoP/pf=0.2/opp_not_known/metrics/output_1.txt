The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
775(1 to 6), 776(6 to 10), 777(9 to 4), 786(2 to 8), 807(5 to 12), 840(7 to 12), 841(10 to 9), 858(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(775: 40.000000), (776: 40.000000), (777: 0.000000), (786: 125.000000), (840: 0.000000), (841: 40.000000), (858: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(775: 3), (776: 8), (777: 3), (786: 6), (807: 4), (840: 6), (841: 7), (858: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 49 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
