The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
585(1 to 6), 586(6 to 10), 587(9 to 4), 593(2 to 8), 601(5 to 12), 620(7 to 12), 621(10 to 9), 628(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(586: 80.000000), (587: 0.000000), (593: 0.000000), (621: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(585: 3), (586: 8), (587: 3), (593: 2), (601: 2), (620: 5), (621: 5), (628: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
