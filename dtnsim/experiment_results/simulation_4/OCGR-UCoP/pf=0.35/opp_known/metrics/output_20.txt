The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
251(1 to 6), 252(6 to 10), 253(9 to 4), 265(2 to 8), 272(5 to 12), 293(7 to 12), 294(10 to 9), 303(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(251: 80.000000), (252: 0.000000), (253: 0.000000), (265: 0.000000), (272: 95.000000), (293: 0.000000), (294: 40.000000), (303: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(251: 4), (252: 8), (253: 3), (265: 2), (272: 5), (293: 6), (294: 5), (303: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 14 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
