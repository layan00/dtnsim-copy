The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
602(1 to 6), 603(6 to 10), 604(9 to 4), 612(2 to 8), 615(5 to 12), 632(7 to 12), 633(10 to 9), 636(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(604: 0.000000), (615: 95.000000), (636: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(602: 3), (603: 7), (604: 3), (612: 2), (615: 4), (632: 4), (633: 3), (636: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
