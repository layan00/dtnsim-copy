The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
241(1 to 6), 242(6 to 10), 243(9 to 4), 252(2 to 8), 261(5 to 12), 275(7 to 12), 276(10 to 9), 281(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 40.000000), (242: 100.000000), (243: 0.000000), (276: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(241: 3), (242: 9), (243: 3), (252: 3), (261: 4), (275: 4), (276: 6), (281: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
