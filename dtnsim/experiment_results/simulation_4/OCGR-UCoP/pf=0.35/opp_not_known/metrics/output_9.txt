The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2157(1 to 6), 2158(6 to 10), 2159(9 to 4), 2166(2 to 8), 2186(5 to 12), 2220(7 to 12), 2221(10 to 9), 2232(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2159: 0.000000), (2166: 0.000000), (2221: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2157: 1), (2158: 5), (2159: 3), (2166: 2), (2186: 2), (2220: 4), (2221: 7), (2232: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
