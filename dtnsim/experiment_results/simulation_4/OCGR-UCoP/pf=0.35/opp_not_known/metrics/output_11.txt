The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
733(1 to 6), 734(6 to 10), 735(9 to 4), 743(2 to 8), 758(5 to 12), 787(7 to 12), 788(10 to 9), 796(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(735: 0.000000), (758: 95.000000), (788: 100.000000), (796: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(733: 1), (734: 8), (735: 3), (743: 2), (758: 4), (787: 3), (788: 8), (796: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 79 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
