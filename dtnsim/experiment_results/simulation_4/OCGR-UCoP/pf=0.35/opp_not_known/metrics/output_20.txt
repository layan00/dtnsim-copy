The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
263(1 to 6), 264(6 to 10), 265(9 to 4), 277(2 to 8), 296(5 to 12), 329(7 to 12), 330(10 to 9), 342(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(264: 0.000000), (265: 0.000000), (277: 0.000000), (296: 95.000000), (329: 0.000000), (342: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(263: 1), (264: 8), (265: 3), (277: 2), (296: 5), (329: 6), (330: 7), (342: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 56 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
