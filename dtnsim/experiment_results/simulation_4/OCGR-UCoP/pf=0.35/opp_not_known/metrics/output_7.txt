The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1217(1 to 6), 1218(6 to 10), 1219(9 to 4), 1227(2 to 8), 1248(5 to 12), 1277(7 to 12), 1278(10 to 9), 1281(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1217: 40.000000), (1219: 0.000000), (1227: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1217: 3), (1218: 8), (1219: 3), (1227: 2), (1248: 2), (1277: 2), (1278: 2), (1281: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
