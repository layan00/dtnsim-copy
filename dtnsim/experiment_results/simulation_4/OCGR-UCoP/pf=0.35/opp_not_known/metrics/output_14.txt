The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2165(1 to 6), 2166(6 to 10), 2167(9 to 4), 2175(2 to 8), 2194(5 to 12), 2225(7 to 12), 2226(10 to 9), 2235(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2165: 120.000000), (2167: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2165: 6), (2166: 5), (2167: 3), (2175: 4), (2194: 2), (2225: 4), (2226: 3), (2235: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 80 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
