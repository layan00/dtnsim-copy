The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
270(1 to 6), 271(6 to 10), 272(9 to 4), 284(2 to 8), 307(5 to 12), 339(7 to 12), 340(10 to 9), 351(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(270: 40.000000), (271: 0.000000), (272: 0.000000), (284: 0.000000), (307: 95.000000), (339: 0.000000), (351: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(270: 3), (271: 8), (272: 3), (284: 2), (307: 4), (339: 6), (340: 3), (351: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 84 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
