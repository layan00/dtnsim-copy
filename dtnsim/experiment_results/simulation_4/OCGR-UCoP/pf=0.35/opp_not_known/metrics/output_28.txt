The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1717(1 to 6), 1718(6 to 10), 1719(9 to 4), 1725(2 to 8), 1747(5 to 12), 1779(7 to 12), 1780(10 to 9), 1784(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1719: 0.000000), (1725: 0.000000), (1784: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1717: 2), (1718: 6), (1719: 3), (1725: 2), (1747: 2), (1779: 3), (1780: 3), (1784: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 63 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
