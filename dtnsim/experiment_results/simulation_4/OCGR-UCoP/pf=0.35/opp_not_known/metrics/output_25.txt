The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
261(1 to 6), 262(6 to 10), 263(9 to 4), 275(2 to 8), 298(5 to 12), 330(7 to 12), 331(10 to 9), 345(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 40.000000), (262: 0.000000), (263: 0.000000), (275: 0.000000), (330: 0.000000), (331: 100.000000), (345: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(261: 3), (262: 8), (263: 3), (275: 2), (298: 3), (330: 6), (331: 8), (345: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 7 calls to RUCoP, which took 44 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
