The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
647(1 to 6), 648(6 to 10), 649(9 to 4), 651(2 to 8), 659(5 to 12), 667(7 to 12), 668(10 to 9), 673(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(651: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(647: 2), (648: 4), (649: 4), (651: 2), (659: 2), (667: 3), (668: 3), (673: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
