The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
424(1 to 6), 425(6 to 10), 426(9 to 4), 427(2 to 8), 435(5 to 12), 444(7 to 12), 445(10 to 9), 449(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(427: 0.000000), (445: 40.000000), (449: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(424: 1), (425: 2), (426: 4), (427: 2), (435: 3), (444: 2), (445: 4), (449: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
