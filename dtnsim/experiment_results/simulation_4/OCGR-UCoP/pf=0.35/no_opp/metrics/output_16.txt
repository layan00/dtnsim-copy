The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
266(1 to 6), 267(6 to 10), 268(9 to 4), 269(2 to 8), 277(5 to 12), 284(7 to 12), 285(10 to 9), 290(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(269: 0.000000), (284: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(266: 1), (267: 7), (268: 4), (269: 2), (277: 2), (284: 3), (285: 3), (290: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
