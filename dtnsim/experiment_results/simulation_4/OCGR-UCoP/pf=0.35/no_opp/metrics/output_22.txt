The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
456(1 to 6), 457(6 to 10), 458(9 to 4), 460(2 to 8), 466(5 to 12), 474(7 to 12), 475(10 to 9), 480(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(460: 0.000000), (466: 95.000000), (474: 80.000000), (475: 40.000000), (480: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(456: 1), (457: 7), (458: 3), (460: 2), (466: 5), (474: 3), (475: 4), (480: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
