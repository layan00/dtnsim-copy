The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
816(1 to 6), 817(6 to 10), 818(9 to 4), 820(2 to 8), 831(5 to 12), 839(7 to 12), 840(10 to 9), 844(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(818: 140.000000), (820: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(816: 3), (817: 3), (818: 5), (820: 2), (831: 2), (839: 2), (840: 2), (844: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
