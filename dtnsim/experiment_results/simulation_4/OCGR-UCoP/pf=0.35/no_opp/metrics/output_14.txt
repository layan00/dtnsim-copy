The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
783(1 to 6), 784(6 to 10), 785(9 to 4), 788(2 to 8), 795(5 to 12), 802(7 to 12), 803(10 to 9), 812(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(783: 120.000000), (784: 160.000000), (788: 125.000000), (803: 40.000000), (812: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(783: 5), (784: 5), (785: 3), (788: 6), (795: 2), (802: 3), (803: 4), (812: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
