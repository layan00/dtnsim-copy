The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
440(1 to 6), 441(6 to 10), 442(9 to 4), 444(2 to 8), 449(5 to 12), 456(7 to 12), 457(10 to 9), 463(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(457: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(440: 1), (441: 2), (442: 3), (444: 7), (449: 4), (456: 2), (457: 5), (463: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
