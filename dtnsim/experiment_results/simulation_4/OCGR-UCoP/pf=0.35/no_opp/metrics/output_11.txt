The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
280(1 to 6), 281(6 to 10), 282(9 to 4), 285(2 to 8), 288(5 to 12), 293(7 to 12), 294(10 to 9), 295(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(288: 95.000000), (293: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(280: 1), (281: 2), (282: 6), (285: 2), (288: 4), (293: 4), (294: 3), (295: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
