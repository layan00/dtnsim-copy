The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
802(1 to 6), 803(6 to 10), 804(9 to 4), 809(2 to 8), 820(5 to 12), 827(7 to 12), 828(10 to 9), 833(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(802: 80.000000), (804: 40.000000), (809: 0.000000), (827: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(802: 4), (803: 2), (804: 5), (809: 2), (820: 2), (827: 4), (828: 3), (833: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
