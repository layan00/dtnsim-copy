The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
591(1 to 6), 592(6 to 10), 593(9 to 4), 596(2 to 8), 603(5 to 12), 613(7 to 12), 614(10 to 9), 619(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(603: 95.000000), (613: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(591: 2), (592: 5), (593: 3), (596: 2), (603: 4), (613: 3), (614: 5), (619: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
