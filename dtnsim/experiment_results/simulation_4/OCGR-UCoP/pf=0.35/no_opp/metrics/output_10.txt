The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
110(1 to 6), 111(6 to 10), 112(9 to 4), 115(2 to 8), 121(5 to 12), 129(7 to 12), 130(10 to 9), 136(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(115: 25.000000), (121: 95.000000), (129: 80.000000), (130: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(110: 2), (111: 5), (112: 3), (115: 3), (121: 4), (129: 3), (130: 5), (136: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
