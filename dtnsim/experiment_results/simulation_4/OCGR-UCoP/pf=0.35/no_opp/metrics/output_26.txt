The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
293(1 to 6), 294(6 to 10), 295(9 to 4), 298(2 to 8), 308(5 to 12), 318(7 to 12), 319(10 to 9), 324(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(295: 140.000000), (298: 0.000000), (318: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(293: 1), (294: 4), (295: 8), (298: 2), (308: 2), (318: 3), (319: 3), (324: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
