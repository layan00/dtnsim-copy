The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
109(1 to 6), 110(6 to 10), 111(9 to 4), 113(2 to 8), 118(5 to 12), 128(7 to 12), 129(10 to 9), 136(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(129: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(109: 1), (110: 3), (111: 3), (113: 3), (118: 3), (128: 2), (129: 5), (136: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
