The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
609(1 to 6), 610(6 to 10), 611(9 to 4), 613(2 to 8), 616(5 to 12), 624(7 to 12), 625(10 to 9), 629(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(610: 160.000000), (611: 140.000000), (624: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(609: 2), (610: 6), (611: 7), (613: 2), (616: 3), (624: 4), (625: 3), (629: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
