The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
279(1 to 6), 280(6 to 10), 281(9 to 4), 283(2 to 8), 294(5 to 12), 302(7 to 12), 303(10 to 9), 309(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(283: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(279: 3), (280: 4), (281: 4), (283: 2), (294: 3), (302: 3), (303: 2), (309: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
