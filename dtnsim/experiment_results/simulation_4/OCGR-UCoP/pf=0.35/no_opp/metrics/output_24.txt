The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
818(1 to 6), 819(6 to 10), 820(9 to 4), 823(2 to 8), 829(5 to 12), 839(7 to 12), 840(10 to 9), 846(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(823: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(818: 2), (819: 4), (820: 3), (823: 3), (829: 2), (839: 3), (840: 4), (846: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
