The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
636(1 to 6), 637(6 to 10), 638(9 to 4), 643(2 to 8), 650(5 to 12), 658(7 to 12), 659(10 to 9), 667(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(636: 80.000000), (637: 160.000000), (638: 40.000000), (643: 0.000000), (658: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 4), (637: 5), (638: 5), (643: 2), (650: 3), (658: 3), (659: 3), (667: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
