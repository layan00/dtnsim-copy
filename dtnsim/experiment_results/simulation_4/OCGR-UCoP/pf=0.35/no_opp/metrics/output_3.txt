The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
637(1 to 6), 638(6 to 10), 639(9 to 4), 641(2 to 8), 649(5 to 12), 657(7 to 12), 658(10 to 9), 661(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(641: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(637: 2), (638: 4), (639: 4), (641: 2), (649: 3), (657: 3), (658: 2), (661: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
