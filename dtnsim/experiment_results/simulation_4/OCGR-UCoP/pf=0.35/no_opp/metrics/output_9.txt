The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
779(1 to 6), 780(6 to 10), 781(9 to 4), 783(2 to 8), 791(5 to 12), 801(7 to 12), 802(10 to 9), 809(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(783: 0.000000), (801: 80.000000), (802: 40.000000), (809: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(779: 1), (780: 4), (781: 3), (783: 2), (791: 2), (801: 3), (802: 4), (809: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
