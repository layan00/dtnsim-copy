The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(1 to 6), 482(6 to 10), 483(9 to 4), 486(2 to 8), 491(5 to 12), 497(7 to 12), 498(10 to 9), 502(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 2), (482: 2), (483: 3), (486: 2), (491: 4), (497: 3), (498: 2), (502: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
