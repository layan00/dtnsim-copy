The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
126(1 to 6), 127(6 to 10), 128(9 to 4), 133(2 to 8), 145(5 to 12), 153(7 to 12), 154(10 to 9), 157(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(126: 80.000000), (127: 160.000000), (128: 40.000000), (133: 0.000000), (145: 95.000000), (153: 80.000000), (157: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(126: 4), (127: 7), (128: 5), (133: 2), (145: 4), (153: 4), (154: 2), (157: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 63 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
