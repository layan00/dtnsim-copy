The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
719(1 to 6), 720(6 to 10), 721(9 to 4), 727(2 to 8), 745(5 to 12), 775(7 to 12), 776(10 to 9), 787(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(719: 40.000000), (721: 0.000000), (775: 0.000000), (787: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(719: 4), (720: 6), (721: 3), (727: 3), (745: 5), (775: 6), (776: 3), (787: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 65 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
