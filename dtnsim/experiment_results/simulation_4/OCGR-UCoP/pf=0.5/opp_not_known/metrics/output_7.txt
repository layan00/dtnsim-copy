The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1153(1 to 6), 1154(6 to 10), 1155(9 to 4), 1162(2 to 8), 1183(5 to 12), 1211(7 to 12), 1212(10 to 9), 1215(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1153: 40.000000), (1155: 120.000000), (1162: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1153: 3), (1154: 8), (1155: 5), (1162: 2), (1183: 2), (1211: 2), (1212: 2), (1215: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 115 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
