The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2039(1 to 6), 2040(6 to 10), 2041(9 to 4), 2047(2 to 8), 2066(5 to 12), 2099(7 to 12), 2100(10 to 9), 2111(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2041: 0.000000), (2047: 0.000000), (2100: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2039: 1), (2040: 6), (2041: 3), (2047: 2), (2066: 2), (2099: 4), (2100: 7), (2111: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 67 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
