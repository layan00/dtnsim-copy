The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
708(1 to 6), 709(6 to 10), 710(9 to 4), 718(2 to 8), 732(5 to 12), 758(7 to 12), 759(10 to 9), 767(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(710: 0.000000), (759: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(708: 1), (709: 7), (710: 3), (718: 2), (732: 2), (758: 3), (759: 8), (767: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 78 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
