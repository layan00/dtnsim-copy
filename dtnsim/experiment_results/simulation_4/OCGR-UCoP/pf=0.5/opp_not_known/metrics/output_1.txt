The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
727(1 to 6), 728(6 to 10), 729(9 to 4), 736(2 to 8), 755(5 to 12), 785(7 to 12), 786(10 to 9), 798(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(727: 40.000000), (729: 80.000000), (736: 125.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(727: 3), (728: 12), (729: 4), (736: 6), (755: 2), (785: 4), (786: 7), (798: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
