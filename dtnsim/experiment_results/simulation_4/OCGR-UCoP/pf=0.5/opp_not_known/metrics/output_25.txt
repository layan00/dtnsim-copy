The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
243(1 to 6), 244(6 to 10), 245(9 to 4), 251(2 to 8), 270(5 to 12), 300(7 to 12), 301(10 to 9), 313(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 40.000000), (245: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 4), (244: 6), (245: 3), (251: 4), (270: 2), (300: 4), (301: 7), (313: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
