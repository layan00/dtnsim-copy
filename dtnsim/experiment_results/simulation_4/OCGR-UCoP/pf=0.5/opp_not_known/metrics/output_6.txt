The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
697(1 to 6), 698(6 to 10), 699(9 to 4), 705(2 to 8), 726(5 to 12), 755(7 to 12), 756(10 to 9), 766(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(699: 80.000000), (756: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(697: 4), (698: 6), (699: 4), (705: 3), (726: 3), (755: 3), (756: 7), (766: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 89 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
