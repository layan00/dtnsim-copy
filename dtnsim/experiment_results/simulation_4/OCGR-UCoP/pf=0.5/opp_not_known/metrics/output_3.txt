The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1618(1 to 6), 1619(6 to 10), 1620(9 to 4), 1626(2 to 8), 1641(5 to 12), 1671(7 to 12), 1672(10 to 9), 1673(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1618: 3), (1619: 6), (1620: 5), (1626: 2), (1641: 3), (1671: 3), (1672: 2), (1673: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 128 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
