The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1157(1 to 6), 1158(6 to 10), 1159(9 to 4), 1165(2 to 8), 1180(5 to 12), 1210(7 to 12), 1211(10 to 9), 1221(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1159: 80.000000), (1211: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1157: 1), (1158: 5), (1159: 4), (1165: 2), (1180: 2), (1210: 3), (1211: 8), (1221: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 77 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
