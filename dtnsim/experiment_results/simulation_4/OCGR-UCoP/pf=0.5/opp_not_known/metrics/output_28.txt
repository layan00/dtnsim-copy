The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1609(1 to 6), 1610(6 to 10), 1611(9 to 4), 1617(2 to 8), 1635(5 to 12), 1667(7 to 12), 1668(10 to 9), 1673(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1611: 0.000000), (1617: 25.000000), (1673: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1609: 1), (1610: 6), (1611: 3), (1617: 3), (1635: 2), (1667: 3), (1668: 3), (1673: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 72 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
