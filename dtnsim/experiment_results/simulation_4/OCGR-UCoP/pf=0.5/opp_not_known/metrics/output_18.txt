The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1591(1 to 6), 1592(6 to 10), 1593(9 to 4), 1600(2 to 8), 1621(5 to 12), 1654(7 to 12), 1655(10 to 9), 1665(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1593: 0.000000), (1654: 0.000000), (1665: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1591: 2), (1592: 5), (1593: 3), (1600: 3), (1621: 2), (1654: 6), (1655: 3), (1665: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
