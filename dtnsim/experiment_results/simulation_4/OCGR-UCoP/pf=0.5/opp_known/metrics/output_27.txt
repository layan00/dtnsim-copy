The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
899(1 to 6), 900(6 to 10), 901(9 to 4), 906(2 to 8), 914(5 to 12), 930(7 to 12), 931(10 to 9), 937(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(899: 40.000000), (900: 120.000000), (901: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(899: 3), (900: 9), (901: 4), (906: 2), (914: 2), (930: 5), (931: 3), (937: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
