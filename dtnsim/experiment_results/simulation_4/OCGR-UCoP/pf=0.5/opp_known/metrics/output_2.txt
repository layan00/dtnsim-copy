The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
923(1 to 6), 924(6 to 10), 925(9 to 4), 931(2 to 8), 934(5 to 12), 949(7 to 12), 950(10 to 9), 955(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(925: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(923: 3), (924: 8), (925: 4), (931: 2), (934: 2), (949: 4), (950: 3), (955: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
