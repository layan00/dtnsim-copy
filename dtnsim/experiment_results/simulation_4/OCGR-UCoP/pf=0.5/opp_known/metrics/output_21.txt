The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
594(1 to 6), 595(6 to 10), 596(9 to 4), 602(2 to 8), 608(5 to 12), 626(7 to 12), 627(10 to 9), 641(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(594: 40.000000), (596: 0.000000), (602: 25.000000), (626: 0.000000), (641: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(594: 3), (595: 4), (596: 3), (602: 6), (608: 5), (626: 6), (627: 2), (641: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
