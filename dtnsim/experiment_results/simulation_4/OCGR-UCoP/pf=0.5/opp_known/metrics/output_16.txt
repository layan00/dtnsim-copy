The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
562(1 to 6), 563(6 to 10), 564(9 to 4), 570(2 to 8), 577(5 to 12), 593(7 to 12), 594(10 to 9), 599(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(563: 120.000000), (564: 0.000000), (570: 0.000000), (594: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(562: 3), (563: 9), (564: 3), (570: 2), (577: 3), (593: 4), (594: 5), (599: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
