The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
575(1 to 6), 576(6 to 10), 577(9 to 4), 585(2 to 8), 587(5 to 12), 601(7 to 12), 602(10 to 9), 605(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(577: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(575: 3), (576: 7), (577: 3), (585: 2), (587: 2), (601: 4), (602: 3), (605: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
