The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1235(1 to 6), 1236(6 to 10), 1237(9 to 4), 1242(2 to 8), 1244(5 to 12), 1263(7 to 12), 1264(10 to 9), 1270(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1237: 80.000000), (1263: 120.000000), (1264: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1235: 3), (1236: 4), (1237: 4), (1242: 2), (1244: 2), (1263: 8), (1264: 5), (1270: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
