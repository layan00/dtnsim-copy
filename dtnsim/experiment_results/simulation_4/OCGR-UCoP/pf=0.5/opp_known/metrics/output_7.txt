The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
908(1 to 6), 909(6 to 10), 910(9 to 4), 917(2 to 8), 926(5 to 12), 942(7 to 12), 943(10 to 9), 950(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(908: 40.000000), (910: 120.000000), (917: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(908: 3), (909: 11), (910: 5), (917: 2), (926: 2), (942: 4), (943: 2), (950: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
