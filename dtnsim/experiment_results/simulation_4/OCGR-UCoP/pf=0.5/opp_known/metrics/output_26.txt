The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
564(1 to 6), 565(6 to 10), 566(9 to 4), 573(2 to 8), 584(5 to 12), 604(7 to 12), 605(10 to 9), 613(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(564: 40.000000), (566: 80.000000), (573: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(564: 3), (565: 9), (566: 4), (573: 2), (584: 2), (604: 5), (605: 4), (613: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
