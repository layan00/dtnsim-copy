The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
900(1 to 6), 901(6 to 10), 902(9 to 4), 908(2 to 8), 911(5 to 12), 929(7 to 12), 930(10 to 9), 937(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(902: 80.000000), (930: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(900: 3), (901: 8), (902: 4), (908: 2), (911: 2), (929: 4), (930: 5), (937: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
