The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1567(1 to 6), 1568(6 to 10), 1569(9 to 4), 1574(2 to 8), 1583(5 to 12), 1601(7 to 12), 1602(10 to 9), 1608(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1568: 80.000000), (1569: 80.000000), (1574: 0.000000), (1602: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1567: 3), (1568: 8), (1569: 4), (1574: 2), (1583: 2), (1601: 4), (1602: 5), (1608: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
