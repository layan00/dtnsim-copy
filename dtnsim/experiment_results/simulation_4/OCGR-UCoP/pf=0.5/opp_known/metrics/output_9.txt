The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1563(1 to 6), 1564(6 to 10), 1565(9 to 4), 1571(2 to 8), 1579(5 to 12), 1600(7 to 12), 1601(10 to 9), 1608(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1563: 40.000000), (1564: 120.000000), (1565: 0.000000), (1571: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1563: 3), (1564: 9), (1565: 3), (1571: 2), (1579: 2), (1600: 6), (1601: 2), (1608: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
