The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
231(1 to 6), 232(6 to 10), 233(9 to 4), 239(2 to 8), 246(5 to 12), 264(7 to 12), 265(10 to 9), 271(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 40.000000), (233: 0.000000), (264: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(231: 3), (232: 4), (233: 3), (239: 3), (246: 2), (264: 8), (265: 3), (271: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
