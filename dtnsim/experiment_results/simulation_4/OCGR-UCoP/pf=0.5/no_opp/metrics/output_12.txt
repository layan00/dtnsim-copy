The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
390(1 to 6), 391(6 to 10), 392(9 to 4), 394(2 to 8), 397(5 to 12), 403(7 to 12), 404(10 to 9), 409(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(404: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(390: 1), (391: 2), (392: 3), (394: 2), (397: 2), (403: 2), (404: 5), (409: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
