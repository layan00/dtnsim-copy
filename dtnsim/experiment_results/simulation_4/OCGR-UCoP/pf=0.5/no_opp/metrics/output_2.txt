The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
418(1 to 6), 419(6 to 10), 420(9 to 4), 422(2 to 8), 425(5 to 12), 428(7 to 12), 429(10 to 9), 432(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(418: 1), (419: 2), (420: 3), (422: 2), (425: 2), (428: 3), (429: 3), (432: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
