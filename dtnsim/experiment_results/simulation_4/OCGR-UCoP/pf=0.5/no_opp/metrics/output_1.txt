The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
275(1 to 6), 276(6 to 10), 277(9 to 4), 280(2 to 8), 286(5 to 12), 292(7 to 12), 293(10 to 9), 297(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(280: 125.000000), (293: 40.000000), (297: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(275: 1), (276: 2), (277: 6), (280: 6), (286: 2), (292: 2), (293: 4), (297: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
