The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
530(1 to 6), 531(6 to 10), 532(9 to 4), 534(2 to 8), 536(5 to 12), 543(7 to 12), 544(10 to 9), 548(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(530: 2), (531: 3), (532: 6), (534: 2), (536: 2), (543: 2), (544: 3), (548: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
