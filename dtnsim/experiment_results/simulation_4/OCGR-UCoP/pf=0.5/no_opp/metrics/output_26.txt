The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
244(1 to 6), 245(6 to 10), 246(9 to 4), 249(2 to 8), 259(5 to 12), 267(7 to 12), 268(10 to 9), 272(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 140.000000), (249: 0.000000), (267: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(244: 1), (245: 4), (246: 9), (249: 2), (259: 2), (267: 3), (268: 3), (272: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
