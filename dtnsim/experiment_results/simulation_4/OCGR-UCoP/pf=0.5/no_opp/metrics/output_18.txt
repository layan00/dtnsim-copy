The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
528(1 to 6), 529(6 to 10), 530(9 to 4), 533(2 to 8), 540(5 to 12), 549(7 to 12), 550(10 to 9), 555(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(549: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(528: 2), (529: 5), (530: 3), (533: 2), (540: 2), (549: 3), (550: 3), (555: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
