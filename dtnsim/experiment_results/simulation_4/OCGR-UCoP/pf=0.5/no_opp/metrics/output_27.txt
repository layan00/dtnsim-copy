The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
394(1 to 6), 395(6 to 10), 396(9 to 4), 397(2 to 8), 404(5 to 12), 408(7 to 12), 409(10 to 9), 410(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(394: 1), (395: 6), (396: 5), (397: 2), (404: 2), (408: 2), (409: 3), (410: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
