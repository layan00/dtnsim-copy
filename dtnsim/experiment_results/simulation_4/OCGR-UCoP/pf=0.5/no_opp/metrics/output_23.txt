The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
561(1 to 6), 562(6 to 10), 563(9 to 4), 568(2 to 8), 575(5 to 12), 581(7 to 12), 582(10 to 9), 590(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(561: 80.000000), (562: 160.000000), (563: 40.000000), (568: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(561: 4), (562: 5), (563: 5), (568: 2), (575: 2), (581: 3), (582: 3), (590: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
