The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
695(1 to 6), 696(6 to 10), 697(9 to 4), 699(2 to 8), 708(5 to 12), 714(7 to 12), 715(10 to 9), 719(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(697: 140.000000), (699: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(695: 3), (696: 3), (697: 5), (699: 2), (708: 2), (714: 2), (715: 2), (719: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
