The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
242(1 to 6), 243(6 to 10), 244(9 to 4), 245(2 to 8), 252(5 to 12), 256(7 to 12), 257(10 to 9), 261(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(245: 0.000000), (256: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(242: 1), (243: 4), (244: 5), (245: 2), (252: 3), (256: 3), (257: 3), (261: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
