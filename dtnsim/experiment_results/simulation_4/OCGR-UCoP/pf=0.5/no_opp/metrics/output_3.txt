The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
549(1 to 6), 550(6 to 10), 551(9 to 4), 553(2 to 8), 556(5 to 12), 562(7 to 12), 563(10 to 9), 565(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(549: 2), (550: 4), (551: 5), (553: 2), (556: 3), (562: 3), (563: 2), (565: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
