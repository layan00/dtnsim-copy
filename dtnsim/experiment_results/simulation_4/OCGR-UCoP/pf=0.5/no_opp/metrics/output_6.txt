The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(1 to 6), 247(6 to 10), 248(9 to 4), 250(2 to 8), 259(5 to 12), 264(7 to 12), 265(10 to 9), 270(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 3), (247: 4), (248: 4), (250: 3), (259: 3), (264: 3), (265: 4), (270: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
