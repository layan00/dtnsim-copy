The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
414(1 to 6), 415(6 to 10), 416(9 to 4), 418(2 to 8), 423(5 to 12), 429(7 to 12), 430(10 to 9), 433(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(418: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(414: 1), (415: 5), (416: 3), (418: 2), (423: 4), (429: 2), (430: 2), (433: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
