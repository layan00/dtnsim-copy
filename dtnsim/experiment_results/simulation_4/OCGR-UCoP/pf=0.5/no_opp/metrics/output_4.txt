The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
692(1 to 6), 693(6 to 10), 694(9 to 4), 696(2 to 8), 706(5 to 12), 712(7 to 12), 713(10 to 9), 718(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(692: 80.000000), (694: 140.000000), (696: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(692: 4), (693: 2), (694: 5), (696: 2), (706: 2), (712: 4), (713: 3), (718: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
