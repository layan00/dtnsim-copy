The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
395(1 to 6), 396(6 to 10), 397(9 to 4), 400(2 to 8), 408(5 to 12), 412(7 to 12), 413(10 to 9), 414(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(400: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(395: 1), (396: 2), (397: 6), (400: 2), (408: 2), (412: 2), (413: 2), (414: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 395: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
