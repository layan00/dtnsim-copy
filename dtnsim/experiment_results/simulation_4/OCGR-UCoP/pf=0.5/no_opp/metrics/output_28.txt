The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
544(1 to 6), 545(6 to 10), 546(9 to 4), 548(2 to 8), 554(5 to 12), 562(7 to 12), 563(10 to 9), 569(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(548: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(544: 2), (545: 4), (546: 4), (548: 3), (554: 2), (562: 3), (563: 3), (569: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
