The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
380(1 to 6), 381(6 to 10), 382(9 to 4), 383(2 to 8), 389(5 to 12), 397(7 to 12), 398(10 to 9), 402(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(383: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(380: 1), (381: 2), (382: 4), (383: 2), (389: 3), (397: 2), (398: 5), (402: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
