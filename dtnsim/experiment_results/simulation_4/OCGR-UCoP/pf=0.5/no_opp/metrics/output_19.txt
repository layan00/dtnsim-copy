The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
679(1 to 6), 680(6 to 10), 681(9 to 4), 682(2 to 8), 688(5 to 12), 695(7 to 12), 696(10 to 9), 700(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(679: 1), (680: 4), (681: 5), (682: 2), (688: 3), (695: 3), (696: 3), (700: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
