The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
584(1 to 6), 585(6 to 10), 586(9 to 4), 587(2 to 8), 592(5 to 12), 598(7 to 12), 599(10 to 9), 604(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(584: 1), (585: 3), (586: 4), (587: 2), (592: 2), (598: 2), (599: 2), (604: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
