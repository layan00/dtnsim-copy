The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
226(1 to 6), 227(6 to 10), 228(9 to 4), 231(2 to 8), 235(5 to 12), 240(7 to 12), 241(10 to 9), 245(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 125.000000), (241: 40.000000), (245: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(226: 1), (227: 2), (228: 4), (231: 6), (235: 2), (240: 2), (241: 4), (245: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
