The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
457(1 to 6), 458(6 to 10), 459(9 to 4), 460(2 to 8), 463(5 to 12), 467(7 to 12), 468(10 to 9), 470(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(457: 1), (458: 4), (459: 5), (460: 2), (463: 3), (467: 3), (468: 2), (470: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
