The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
101(1 to 6), 102(6 to 10), 103(9 to 4), 106(2 to 8), 109(5 to 12), 116(7 to 12), 117(10 to 9), 122(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(103: 140.000000), (117: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(101: 1), (102: 3), (103: 6), (106: 6), (109: 2), (116: 2), (117: 4), (122: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
