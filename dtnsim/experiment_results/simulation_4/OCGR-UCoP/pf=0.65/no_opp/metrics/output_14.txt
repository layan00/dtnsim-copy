The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
615(1 to 6), 616(6 to 10), 617(9 to 4), 619(2 to 8), 624(5 to 12), 629(7 to 12), 630(10 to 9), 636(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(615: 1), (616: 4), (617: 3), (619: 6), (624: 2), (629: 3), (630: 2), (636: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
