The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
91(1 to 6), 92(6 to 10), 93(9 to 4), 98(2 to 8), 107(5 to 12), 109(7 to 12), 110(10 to 9), 112(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(91: 3), (92: 4), (93: 6), (98: 3), (107: 3), (109: 3), (110: 4), (112: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
