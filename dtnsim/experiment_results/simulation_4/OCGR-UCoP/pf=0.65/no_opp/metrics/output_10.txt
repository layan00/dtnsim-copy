The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
92(1 to 6), 93(6 to 10), 94(9 to 4), 96(2 to 8), 99(5 to 12), 105(7 to 12), 106(10 to 9), 111(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(96: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(92: 2), (93: 3), (94: 4), (96: 3), (99: 2), (105: 2), (106: 3), (111: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
