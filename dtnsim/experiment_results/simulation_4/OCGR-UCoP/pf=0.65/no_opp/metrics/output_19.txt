The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
578(1 to 6), 579(6 to 10), 580(9 to 4), 581(2 to 8), 586(5 to 12), 591(7 to 12), 592(10 to 9), 596(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(578: 1), (579: 4), (580: 5), (581: 2), (586: 3), (591: 3), (592: 3), (596: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
