The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
345(1 to 6), 346(6 to 10), 347(9 to 4), 348(2 to 8), 354(5 to 12), 358(7 to 12), 359(10 to 9), 360(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(348: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(345: 1), (346: 2), (347: 4), (348: 2), (354: 2), (358: 2), (359: 2), (360: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
