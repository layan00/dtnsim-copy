The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
349(1 to 6), 350(6 to 10), 351(9 to 4), 353(2 to 8), 356(5 to 12), 361(7 to 12), 362(10 to 9), 365(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(362: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(349: 1), (350: 5), (351: 5), (353: 2), (356: 2), (361: 3), (362: 5), (365: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
