The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
485(1 to 6), 486(6 to 10), 487(9 to 4), 490(2 to 8), 492(5 to 12), 497(7 to 12), 498(10 to 9), 499(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(492: 95.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(485: 2), (486: 2), (487: 4), (490: 2), (492: 4), (497: 2), (498: 2), (499: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 485: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 492: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),

Bundle 492: (to: 12, time: 120.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 499: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 492: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 492: (to: 4, time: 20.000000),
