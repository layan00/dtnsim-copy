The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
464(1 to 6), 465(6 to 10), 466(9 to 4), 468(2 to 8), 469(5 to 12), 474(7 to 12), 475(10 to 9), 478(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(464: 2), (465: 4), (466: 4), (468: 2), (469: 2), (474: 2), (475: 3), (478: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
