The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(1 to 6), 246(6 to 10), 247(9 to 4), 248(2 to 8), 253(5 to 12), 259(7 to 12), 260(10 to 9), 263(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 1), (246: 2), (247: 4), (248: 3), (253: 5), (259: 3), (260: 2), (263: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
