The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
589(1 to 6), 590(6 to 10), 591(9 to 4), 593(2 to 8), 602(5 to 12), 607(7 to 12), 608(10 to 9), 611(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(591: 140.000000), (593: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(589: 3), (590: 4), (591: 5), (593: 2), (602: 2), (607: 2), (608: 2), (611: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
