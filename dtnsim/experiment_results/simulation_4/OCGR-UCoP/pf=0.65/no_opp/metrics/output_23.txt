The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
516(1 to 6), 517(6 to 10), 518(9 to 4), 521(2 to 8), 525(5 to 12), 530(7 to 12), 531(10 to 9), 536(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(521: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(516: 1), (517: 2), (518: 6), (521: 3), (525: 2), (530: 3), (531: 3), (536: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
