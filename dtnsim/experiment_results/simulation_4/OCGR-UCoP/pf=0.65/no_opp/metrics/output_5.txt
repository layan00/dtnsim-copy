The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
90(1 to 6), 91(6 to 10), 92(9 to 4), 93(2 to 8), 97(5 to 12), 101(7 to 12), 102(10 to 9), 106(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(102: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(90: 1), (91: 3), (92: 5), (93: 3), (97: 2), (101: 2), (102: 5), (106: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
