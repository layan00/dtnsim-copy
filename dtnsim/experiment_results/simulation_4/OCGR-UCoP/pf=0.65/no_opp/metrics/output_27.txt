The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
326(1 to 6), 327(6 to 10), 328(9 to 4), 329(2 to 8), 335(5 to 12), 339(7 to 12), 340(10 to 9), 341(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(326: 1), (327: 6), (328: 5), (329: 2), (335: 2), (339: 2), (340: 3), (341: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
