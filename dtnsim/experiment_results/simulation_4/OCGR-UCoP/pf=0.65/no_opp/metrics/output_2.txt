The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
349(1 to 6), 350(6 to 10), 351(9 to 4), 352(2 to 8), 353(5 to 12), 355(7 to 12), 356(10 to 9), 358(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(349: 1), (350: 2), (351: 4), (352: 2), (353: 2), (355: 2), (356: 3), (358: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
