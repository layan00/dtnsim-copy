The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 6), 219(6 to 10), 220(9 to 4), 222(2 to 8), 228(5 to 12), 232(7 to 12), 233(10 to 9), 236(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 3), (219: 2), (220: 4), (222: 3), (228: 3), (232: 3), (233: 2), (236: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
