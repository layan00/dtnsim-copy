The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
456(1 to 6), 457(6 to 10), 458(9 to 4), 461(2 to 8), 467(5 to 12), 474(7 to 12), 475(10 to 9), 479(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(474: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(456: 2), (457: 4), (458: 3), (461: 2), (467: 2), (474: 3), (475: 2), (479: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
