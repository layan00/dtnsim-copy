The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
234(1 to 6), 235(6 to 10), 236(9 to 4), 241(2 to 8), 257(5 to 12), 285(7 to 12), 286(10 to 9), 289(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 120.000000), (286: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(234: 1), (235: 5), (236: 5), (241: 3), (257: 2), (285: 2), (286: 5), (289: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 131 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
