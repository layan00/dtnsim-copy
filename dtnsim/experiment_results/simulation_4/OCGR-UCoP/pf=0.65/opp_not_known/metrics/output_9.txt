The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1949(1 to 6), 1950(6 to 10), 1951(9 to 4), 1957(2 to 8), 1974(5 to 12), 2004(7 to 12), 2005(10 to 9), 2008(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1951: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1949: 1), (1950: 6), (1951: 3), (1957: 2), (1974: 2), (2004: 2), (2005: 2), (2008: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
