The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
238(1 to 6), 239(6 to 10), 240(9 to 4), 246(2 to 8), 261(5 to 12), 291(7 to 12), 292(10 to 9), 301(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(240: 80.000000), (291: 0.000000), (301: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(238: 1), (239: 6), (240: 4), (246: 3), (261: 2), (291: 6), (292: 3), (301: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
