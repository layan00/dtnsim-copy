The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1589(1 to 6), 1590(6 to 10), 1591(9 to 4), 1598(2 to 8), 1615(5 to 12), 1644(7 to 12), 1645(10 to 9), 1652(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1589: 40.000000), (1591: 120.000000), (1598: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1589: 3), (1590: 8), (1591: 5), (1598: 3), (1615: 2), (1644: 3), (1645: 3), (1652: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
