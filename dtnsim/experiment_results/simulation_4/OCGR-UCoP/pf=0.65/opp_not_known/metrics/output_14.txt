The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1988(1 to 6), 1989(6 to 10), 1990(9 to 4), 1997(2 to 8), 2014(5 to 12), 2043(7 to 12), 2044(10 to 9), 2048(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1990: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1988: 1), (1989: 5), (1990: 3), (1997: 6), (2014: 2), (2043: 3), (2044: 2), (2048: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 68 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
