The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1944(1 to 6), 1945(6 to 10), 1946(9 to 4), 1952(2 to 8), 1974(5 to 12), 2002(7 to 12), 2003(10 to 9), 2006(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1946: 80.000000), (1952: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1944: 3), (1945: 7), (1946: 4), (1952: 2), (1974: 2), (2002: 2), (2003: 2), (2006: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 91 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
