The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1095(1 to 6), 1096(6 to 10), 1097(9 to 4), 1102(2 to 8), 1120(5 to 12), 1148(7 to 12), 1149(10 to 9), 1150(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1097: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1095: 1), (1096: 7), (1097: 4), (1102: 2), (1120: 2), (1148: 2), (1149: 3), (1150: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 98 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
