The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1087(1 to 6), 1088(6 to 10), 1089(9 to 4), 1094(2 to 8), 1110(5 to 12), 1137(7 to 12), 1138(10 to 9), 1140(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1089: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1087: 1), (1088: 6), (1089: 4), (1094: 3), (1110: 3), (1137: 2), (1138: 2), (1140: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 132 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
