The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
681(1 to 6), 682(6 to 10), 683(9 to 4), 690(2 to 8), 706(5 to 12), 735(7 to 12), 736(10 to 9), 745(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(683: 80.000000), (690: 125.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(681: 1), (682: 6), (683: 4), (690: 6), (706: 2), (735: 3), (736: 7), (745: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 99 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
