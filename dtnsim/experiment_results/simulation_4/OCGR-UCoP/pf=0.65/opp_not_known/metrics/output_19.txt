The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1946(1 to 6), 1947(6 to 10), 1948(9 to 4), 1953(2 to 8), 1970(5 to 12), 1999(7 to 12), 2000(10 to 9), 2004(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1947: 160.000000), (1948: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1946: 1), (1947: 7), (1948: 5), (1953: 2), (1970: 3), (1999: 3), (2000: 3), (2004: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 98 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
