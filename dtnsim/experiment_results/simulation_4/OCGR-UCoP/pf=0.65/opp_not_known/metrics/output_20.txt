The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(1 to 6), 246(6 to 10), 247(9 to 4), 254(2 to 8), 269(5 to 12), 300(7 to 12), 301(10 to 9), 308(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 160.000000), (247: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 1), (246: 8), (247: 4), (254: 6), (269: 2), (300: 4), (301: 3), (308: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 93 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
