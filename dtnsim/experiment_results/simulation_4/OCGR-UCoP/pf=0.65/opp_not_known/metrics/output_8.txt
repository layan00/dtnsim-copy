The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1523(1 to 6), 1524(6 to 10), 1525(9 to 4), 1531(2 to 8), 1544(5 to 12), 1573(7 to 12), 1574(10 to 9), 1580(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1525: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1523: 2), (1524: 6), (1525: 4), (1531: 2), (1544: 2), (1573: 4), (1574: 3), (1580: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
