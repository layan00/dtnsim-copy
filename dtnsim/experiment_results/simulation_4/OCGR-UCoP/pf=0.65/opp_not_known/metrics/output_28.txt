The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1527(1 to 6), 1528(6 to 10), 1529(9 to 4), 1535(2 to 8), 1553(5 to 12), 1583(7 to 12), 1584(10 to 9), 1587(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1529: 0.000000), (1535: 25.000000), (1587: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1527: 1), (1528: 6), (1529: 3), (1535: 3), (1553: 2), (1583: 2), (1584: 2), (1587: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 79 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
