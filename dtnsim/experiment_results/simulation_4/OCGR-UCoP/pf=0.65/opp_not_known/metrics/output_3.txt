The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1518(1 to 6), 1519(6 to 10), 1520(9 to 4), 1525(2 to 8), 1540(5 to 12), 1568(7 to 12), 1569(10 to 9), 1570(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1518: 1), (1519: 6), (1520: 5), (1525: 2), (1540: 3), (1568: 3), (1569: 2), (1570: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
