The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2028(1 to 6), 2029(6 to 10), 2030(9 to 4), 2036(2 to 8), 2051(5 to 12), 2081(7 to 12), 2082(10 to 9), 2092(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2030: 80.000000), (2082: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2028: 1), (2029: 5), (2030: 4), (2036: 2), (2051: 2), (2081: 3), (2082: 7), (2092: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 85 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
