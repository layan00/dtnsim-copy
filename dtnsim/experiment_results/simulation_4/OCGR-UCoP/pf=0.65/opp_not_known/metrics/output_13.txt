The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1550(1 to 6), 1551(6 to 10), 1552(9 to 4), 1560(2 to 8), 1574(5 to 12), 1603(7 to 12), 1604(10 to 9), 1605(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1552: 0.000000), (1574: 95.000000), (1605: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1550: 3), (1551: 6), (1552: 3), (1560: 2), (1574: 4), (1603: 2), (1604: 2), (1605: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 84 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
