The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
235(1 to 6), 236(6 to 10), 237(9 to 4), 246(2 to 8), 267(5 to 12), 293(7 to 12), 294(10 to 9), 295(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 100.000000), (237: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(235: 4), (236: 8), (237: 4), (246: 3), (267: 3), (293: 3), (294: 4), (295: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 54 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
