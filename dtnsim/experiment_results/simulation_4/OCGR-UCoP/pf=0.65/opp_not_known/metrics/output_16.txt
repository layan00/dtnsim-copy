The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
667(1 to 6), 668(6 to 10), 669(9 to 4), 674(2 to 8), 690(5 to 12), 717(7 to 12), 718(10 to 9), 721(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(669: 120.000000), (674: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(667: 1), (668: 6), (669: 5), (674: 2), (690: 3), (717: 2), (718: 2), (721: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
