The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
672(1 to 6), 673(6 to 10), 674(9 to 4), 682(2 to 8), 696(5 to 12), 722(7 to 12), 723(10 to 9), 731(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 0.000000), (723: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(672: 1), (673: 6), (674: 3), (682: 2), (696: 2), (722: 3), (723: 8), (731: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
