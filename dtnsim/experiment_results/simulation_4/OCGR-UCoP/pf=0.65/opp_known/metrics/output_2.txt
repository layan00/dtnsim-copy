The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
856(1 to 6), 857(6 to 10), 858(9 to 4), 863(2 to 8), 864(5 to 12), 878(7 to 12), 879(10 to 9), 882(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(856: 3), (857: 4), (858: 5), (863: 2), (864: 2), (878: 4), (879: 3), (882: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
