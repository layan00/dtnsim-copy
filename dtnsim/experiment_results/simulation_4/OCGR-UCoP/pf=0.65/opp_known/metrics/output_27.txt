The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
834(1 to 6), 835(6 to 10), 836(9 to 4), 841(2 to 8), 847(5 to 12), 863(7 to 12), 864(10 to 9), 868(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(836: 80.000000), (863: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(834: 3), (835: 7), (836: 4), (841: 2), (847: 2), (863: 8), (864: 3), (868: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
