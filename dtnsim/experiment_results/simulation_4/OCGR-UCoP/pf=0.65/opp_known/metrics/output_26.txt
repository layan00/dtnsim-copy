The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
516(1 to 6), 517(6 to 10), 518(9 to 4), 525(2 to 8), 534(5 to 12), 551(7 to 12), 552(10 to 9), 558(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(516: 40.000000), (518: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(516: 3), (517: 9), (518: 4), (525: 3), (534: 2), (551: 5), (552: 3), (558: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
