The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1501(1 to 6), 1502(6 to 10), 1503(9 to 4), 1510(2 to 8), 1516(5 to 12), 1533(7 to 12), 1534(10 to 9), 1541(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1501: 40.000000), (1503: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1501: 3), (1502: 8), (1503: 3), (1510: 3), (1516: 2), (1533: 4), (1534: 2), (1541: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
