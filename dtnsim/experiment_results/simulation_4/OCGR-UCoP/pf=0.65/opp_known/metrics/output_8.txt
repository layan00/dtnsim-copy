The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1157(1 to 6), 1158(6 to 10), 1159(9 to 4), 1164(2 to 8), 1165(5 to 12), 1182(7 to 12), 1183(10 to 9), 1189(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1159: 80.000000), (1183: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1157: 3), (1158: 4), (1159: 4), (1164: 2), (1165: 2), (1182: 6), (1183: 5), (1189: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
