The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 6), 225(6 to 10), 226(9 to 4), 231(2 to 8), 234(5 to 12), 252(7 to 12), 253(10 to 9), 257(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(226: 120.000000), (231: 25.000000), (257: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 3), (225: 4), (226: 5), (231: 3), (234: 2), (252: 4), (253: 3), (257: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
