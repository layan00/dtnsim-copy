The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
542(1 to 6), 543(6 to 10), 544(9 to 4), 552(2 to 8), 554(5 to 12), 568(7 to 12), 569(10 to 9), 572(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(544: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(542: 3), (543: 7), (544: 3), (552: 2), (554: 2), (568: 4), (569: 3), (572: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
