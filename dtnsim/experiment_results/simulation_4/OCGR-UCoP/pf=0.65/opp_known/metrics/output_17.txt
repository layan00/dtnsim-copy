The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
843(1 to 6), 844(6 to 10), 845(9 to 4), 850(2 to 8), 854(5 to 12), 869(7 to 12), 870(10 to 9), 874(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(845: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(843: 3), (844: 4), (845: 4), (850: 3), (854: 3), (869: 4), (870: 2), (874: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
