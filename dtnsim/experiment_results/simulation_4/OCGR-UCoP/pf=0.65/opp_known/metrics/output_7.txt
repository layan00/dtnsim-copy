The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
849(1 to 6), 850(6 to 10), 851(9 to 4), 856(2 to 8), 863(5 to 12), 879(7 to 12), 880(10 to 9), 885(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(849: 40.000000), (851: 120.000000), (856: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(849: 3), (850: 4), (851: 5), (856: 2), (863: 2), (879: 4), (880: 2), (885: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
