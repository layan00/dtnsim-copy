The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 6), 216(6 to 10), 217(9 to 4), 222(2 to 8), 226(5 to 12), 243(7 to 12), 244(10 to 9), 248(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 3), (216: 4), (217: 5), (222: 3), (226: 2), (243: 6), (244: 2), (248: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
