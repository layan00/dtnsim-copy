The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
856(1 to 6), 857(6 to 10), 858(9 to 4), 864(2 to 8), 867(5 to 12), 884(7 to 12), 885(10 to 9), 892(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(858: 80.000000), (885: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(856: 3), (857: 8), (858: 4), (864: 2), (867: 2), (884: 4), (885: 5), (892: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
