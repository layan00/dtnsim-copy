The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
541(1 to 6), 542(6 to 10), 543(9 to 4), 548(2 to 8), 552(5 to 12), 567(7 to 12), 568(10 to 9), 572(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(543: 120.000000), (548: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(541: 3), (542: 4), (543: 5), (548: 2), (552: 3), (567: 4), (568: 2), (572: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
