The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1453(1 to 6), 1454(6 to 10), 1455(9 to 4), 1460(2 to 8), 1469(5 to 12), 1485(7 to 12), 1486(10 to 9), 1491(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1454: 80.000000), (1455: 80.000000), (1460: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1453: 3), (1454: 8), (1455: 4), (1460: 2), (1469: 2), (1485: 4), (1486: 2), (1491: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
