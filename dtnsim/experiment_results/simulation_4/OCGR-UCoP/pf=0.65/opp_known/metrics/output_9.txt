The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1465(1 to 6), 1466(6 to 10), 1467(9 to 4), 1473(2 to 8), 1479(5 to 12), 1497(7 to 12), 1498(10 to 9), 1505(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1465: 40.000000), (1466: 120.000000), (1467: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1465: 3), (1466: 9), (1467: 3), (1473: 2), (1479: 2), (1497: 6), (1498: 2), (1505: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
