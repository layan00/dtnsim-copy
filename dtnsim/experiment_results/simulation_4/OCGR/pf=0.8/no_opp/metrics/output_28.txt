The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
388(1 to 6), 389(6 to 10), 390(9 to 4), 391(2 to 8), 395(5 to 12), 400(7 to 12), 401(10 to 9), 403(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(388: 1), (389: 3), (390: 3), (391: 2), (395: 2), (400: 2), (401: 1), (403: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 388: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 390: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
