The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
299(1 to 6), 300(6 to 10), 301(9 to 4), 302(2 to 8), 303(5 to 12), 305(7 to 12), 306(10 to 9), 308(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(299: 1), (300: 3), (301: 3), (302: 2), (303: 2), (305: 2), (306: 1), (308: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 299: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
