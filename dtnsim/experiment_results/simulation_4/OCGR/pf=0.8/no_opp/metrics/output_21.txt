The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(1 to 6), 209(6 to 10), 210(9 to 4), 211(2 to 8), 213(5 to 12), 217(7 to 12), 218(10 to 9), 219(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 1), (209: 3), (210: 3), (211: 2), (213: 2), (217: 2), (218: 2), (219: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 208: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
