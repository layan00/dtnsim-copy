The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
500(1 to 6), 501(6 to 10), 502(9 to 4), 504(2 to 8), 510(5 to 12), 513(7 to 12), 514(10 to 9), 515(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(504: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(500: 3), (501: 3), (502: 3), (504: 2), (510: 2), (513: 2), (514: 2), (515: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 500: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 500: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),

Node 5: 
Bundle 510: (to: 4, time: 20.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 514: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 501: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), (to: 4, time: 80.000000), (to: 7, time: 100.000000),
