The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
505(1 to 6), 506(6 to 10), 507(9 to 4), 508(2 to 8), 512(5 to 12), 515(7 to 12), 516(10 to 9), 518(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(505: 1), (506: 3), (507: 3), (508: 2), (512: 2), (515: 2), (516: 1), (518: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
