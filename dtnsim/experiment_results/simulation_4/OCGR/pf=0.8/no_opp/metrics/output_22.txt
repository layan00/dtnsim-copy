The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
312(1 to 6), 313(6 to 10), 314(9 to 4), 315(2 to 8), 317(5 to 12), 321(7 to 12), 322(10 to 9), 324(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(315: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(312: 1), (313: 3), (314: 3), (315: 3), (317: 3), (321: 2), (322: 1), (324: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 312: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 315: (to: 12, time: 0.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 324: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 317: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 317: (to: 4, time: 20.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 313: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), (to: 4, time: 80.000000), (to: 7, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 321: (to: 1, time: 40.000000), (to: 1, time: 100.000000), 
Node 8:
