The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
422(1 to 6), 423(6 to 10), 424(9 to 4), 426(2 to 8), 429(5 to 12), 433(7 to 12), 434(10 to 9), 437(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(422: 1), (423: 3), (424: 4), (426: 3), (429: 2), (433: 2), (434: 1), (437: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
