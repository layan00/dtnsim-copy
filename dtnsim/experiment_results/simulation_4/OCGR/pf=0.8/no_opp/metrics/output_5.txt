The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
85(1 to 6), 86(6 to 10), 87(9 to 4), 88(2 to 8), 91(5 to 12), 95(7 to 12), 96(10 to 9), 98(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(85: 1), (86: 3), (87: 4), (88: 3), (91: 2), (95: 2), (96: 1), (98: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
