The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
170(1 to 6), 171(6 to 10), 172(9 to 4), 173(2 to 8), 176(5 to 12), 181(7 to 12), 182(10 to 9), 184(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(170: 1), (171: 4), (172: 3), (173: 2), (176: 2), (181: 2), (182: 1), (184: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 170: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
