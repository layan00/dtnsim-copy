The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
495(1 to 6), 496(6 to 10), 497(9 to 4), 499(2 to 8), 504(5 to 12), 507(7 to 12), 508(10 to 9), 509(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(495: 3), (496: 3), (497: 3), (499: 3), (504: 2), (507: 2), (508: 1), (509: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 495: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
