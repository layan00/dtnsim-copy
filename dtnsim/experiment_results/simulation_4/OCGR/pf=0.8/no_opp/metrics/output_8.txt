The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
403(1 to 6), 404(6 to 10), 405(9 to 4), 407(2 to 8), 408(5 to 12), 412(7 to 12), 413(10 to 9), 414(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(403: 2), (404: 3), (405: 3), (407: 2), (408: 2), (412: 2), (413: 1), (414: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 403: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 403: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 407: (to: 12, time: 0.000000), (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 414: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 414: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 408: (to: 4, time: 20.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 404: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), (to: 4, time: 80.000000), (to: 7, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 412: (to: 1, time: 40.000000), (to: 1, time: 100.000000),
