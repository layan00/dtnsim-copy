The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
386(1 to 6), 387(6 to 10), 388(9 to 4), 390(2 to 8), 392(5 to 12), 395(7 to 12), 396(10 to 9), 397(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(386: 1), (387: 6), (388: 4), (390: 2), (392: 4), (395: 2), (396: 1), (397: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
