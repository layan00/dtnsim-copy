The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
86(1 to 6), 87(6 to 10), 88(9 to 4), 93(2 to 8), 101(5 to 12), 103(7 to 12), 104(10 to 9), 106(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(86: 3), (87: 3), (88: 6), (93: 3), (101: 3), (103: 2), (104: 3), (106: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
