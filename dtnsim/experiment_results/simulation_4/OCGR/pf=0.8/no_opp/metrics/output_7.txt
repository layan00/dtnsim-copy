The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
302(1 to 6), 303(6 to 10), 304(9 to 4), 305(2 to 8), 307(5 to 12), 310(7 to 12), 311(10 to 9), 312(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(302: 1), (303: 3), (304: 3), (305: 2), (307: 2), (310: 2), (311: 1), (312: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 302: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
