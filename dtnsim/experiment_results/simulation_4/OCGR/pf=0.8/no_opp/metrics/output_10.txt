The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
78(1 to 6), 79(6 to 10), 80(9 to 4), 81(2 to 8), 82(5 to 12), 84(7 to 12), 85(10 to 9), 87(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 1), (79: 4), (80: 3), (81: 2), (82: 2), (84: 3), (85: 1), (87: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
