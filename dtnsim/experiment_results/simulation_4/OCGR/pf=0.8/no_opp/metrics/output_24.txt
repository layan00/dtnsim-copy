The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
532(1 to 6), 533(6 to 10), 534(9 to 4), 537(2 to 8), 540(5 to 12), 543(7 to 12), 544(10 to 9), 545(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(532: 2), (533: 3), (534: 4), (537: 2), (540: 2), (543: 2), (544: 1), (545: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 532: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 532: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),

Node 5: 
Bundle 540: (to: 4, time: 20.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 533: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), (to: 4, time: 80.000000),
