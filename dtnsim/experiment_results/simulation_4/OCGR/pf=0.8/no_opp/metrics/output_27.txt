The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
274(1 to 6), 275(6 to 10), 276(9 to 4), 277(2 to 8), 280(5 to 12), 283(7 to 12), 284(10 to 9), 285(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(274: 1), (275: 4), (276: 4), (277: 2), (280: 2), (283: 2), (284: 2), (285: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
