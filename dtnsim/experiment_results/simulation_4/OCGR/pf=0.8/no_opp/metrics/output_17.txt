The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
280(1 to 6), 281(6 to 10), 282(9 to 4), 283(2 to 8), 285(5 to 12), 287(7 to 12), 288(10 to 9), 289(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(280: 1), (281: 4), (282: 3), (283: 2), (285: 2), (287: 2), (288: 1), (289: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 280: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 281: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
