The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(1 to 6), 482(6 to 10), 483(9 to 4), 484(2 to 8), 485(5 to 12), 488(7 to 12), 489(10 to 9), 490(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 1), (482: 3), (483: 4), (484: 2), (485: 2), (488: 3), (489: 1), (490: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
