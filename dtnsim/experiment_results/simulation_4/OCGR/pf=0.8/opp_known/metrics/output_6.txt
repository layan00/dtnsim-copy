The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
518(1 to 6), 519(6 to 10), 520(9 to 4), 525(2 to 8), 529(5 to 12), 545(7 to 12), 546(10 to 9), 549(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(518: 3), (519: 3), (520: 6), (525: 3), (529: 3), (545: 4), (546: 1), (549: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
