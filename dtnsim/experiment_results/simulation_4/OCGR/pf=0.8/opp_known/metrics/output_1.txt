The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(1 to 6), 528(6 to 10), 529(9 to 4), 536(2 to 8), 540(5 to 12), 556(7 to 12), 557(10 to 9), 560(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 80.000000), (529: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 4), (528: 8), (529: 5), (536: 3), (540: 2), (556: 4), (557: 1), (560: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
