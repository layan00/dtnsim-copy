The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
795(1 to 6), 796(6 to 10), 797(9 to 4), 802(2 to 8), 804(5 to 12), 819(7 to 12), 820(10 to 9), 823(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(797: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(795: 3), (796: 3), (797: 5), (802: 2), (804: 2), (819: 4), (820: 1), (823: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
