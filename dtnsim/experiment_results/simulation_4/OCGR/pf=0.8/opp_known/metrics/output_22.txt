The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
811(1 to 6), 812(6 to 10), 813(9 to 4), 818(2 to 8), 820(5 to 12), 836(7 to 12), 837(10 to 9), 842(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(811: 160.000000), (813: 120.000000), (818: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(811: 5), (812: 3), (813: 6), (818: 3), (820: 3), (836: 6), (837: 1), (842: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
