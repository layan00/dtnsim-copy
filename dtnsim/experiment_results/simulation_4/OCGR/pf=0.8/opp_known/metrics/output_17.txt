The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
790(1 to 6), 791(6 to 10), 792(9 to 4), 797(2 to 8), 799(5 to 12), 813(7 to 12), 814(10 to 9), 817(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(792: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(790: 3), (791: 3), (792: 5), (797: 2), (799: 2), (813: 4), (814: 1), (817: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
