The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1385(1 to 6), 1386(6 to 10), 1387(9 to 4), 1392(2 to 8), 1395(5 to 12), 1410(7 to 12), 1411(10 to 9), 1414(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1385: 80.000000), (1387: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1385: 4), (1386: 3), (1387: 6), (1392: 2), (1395: 2), (1410: 6), (1411: 1), (1414: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
