The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1378(1 to 6), 1379(6 to 10), 1380(9 to 4), 1387(2 to 8), 1393(5 to 12), 1407(7 to 12), 1408(10 to 9), 1415(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1378: 40.000000), (1380: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1378: 3), (1379: 10), (1380: 3), (1387: 3), (1393: 2), (1407: 6), (1408: 1), (1415: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
