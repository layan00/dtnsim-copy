The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1097(1 to 6), 1098(6 to 10), 1099(9 to 4), 1104(2 to 8), 1105(5 to 12), 1121(7 to 12), 1122(10 to 9), 1126(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1099: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1097: 3), (1098: 3), (1099: 6), (1104: 2), (1105: 2), (1121: 6), (1122: 1), (1126: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
