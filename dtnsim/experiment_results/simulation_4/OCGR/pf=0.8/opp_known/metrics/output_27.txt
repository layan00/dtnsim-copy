The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
785(1 to 6), 786(6 to 10), 787(9 to 4), 792(2 to 8), 795(5 to 12), 810(7 to 12), 811(10 to 9), 814(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(787: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(785: 3), (786: 3), (787: 5), (792: 2), (795: 2), (810: 6), (811: 2), (814: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
