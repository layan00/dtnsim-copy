The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1082(1 to 6), 1083(6 to 10), 1084(9 to 4), 1090(2 to 8), 1093(5 to 12), 1110(7 to 12), 1111(10 to 9), 1114(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1082: 80.000000), (1084: 0.000000), (1114: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1082: 4), (1083: 3), (1084: 3), (1090: 2), (1093: 2), (1110: 4), (1111: 1), (1114: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
