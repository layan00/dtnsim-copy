The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
806(1 to 6), 807(6 to 10), 808(9 to 4), 813(2 to 8), 815(5 to 12), 830(7 to 12), 831(10 to 9), 834(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(806: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(806: 4), (807: 3), (808: 6), (813: 2), (815: 2), (830: 6), (831: 1), (834: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
