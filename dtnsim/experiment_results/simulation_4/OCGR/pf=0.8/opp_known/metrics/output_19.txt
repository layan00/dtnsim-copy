The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1367(1 to 6), 1368(6 to 10), 1369(9 to 4), 1374(2 to 8), 1375(5 to 12), 1390(7 to 12), 1391(10 to 9), 1394(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1367: 3), (1368: 3), (1369: 6), (1374: 2), (1375: 2), (1390: 4), (1391: 1), (1394: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
