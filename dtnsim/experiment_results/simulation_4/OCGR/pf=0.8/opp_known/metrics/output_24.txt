The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1411(1 to 6), 1412(6 to 10), 1413(9 to 4), 1419(2 to 8), 1422(5 to 12), 1437(7 to 12), 1438(10 to 9), 1443(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1411: 80.000000), (1413: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1411: 4), (1412: 8), (1413: 5), (1419: 2), (1422: 2), (1437: 4), (1438: 1), (1443: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
