The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
498(1 to 6), 499(6 to 10), 500(9 to 4), 505(2 to 8), 506(5 to 12), 519(7 to 12), 520(10 to 9), 523(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(498: 160.000000), (500: 80.000000), (519: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(498: 5), (499: 3), (500: 5), (505: 2), (506: 2), (519: 7), (520: 2), (523: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
