The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
490(1 to 6), 491(6 to 10), 492(9 to 4), 497(2 to 8), 500(5 to 12), 517(7 to 12), 518(10 to 9), 522(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(490: 80.000000), (517: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(490: 4), (491: 3), (492: 6), (497: 2), (500: 2), (517: 7), (518: 1), (522: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
