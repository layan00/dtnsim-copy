The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 6), 211(6 to 10), 212(9 to 4), 217(2 to 8), 218(5 to 12), 232(7 to 12), 233(10 to 9), 239(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 160.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 5), (211: 3), (212: 8), (217: 2), (218: 2), (232: 4), (233: 1), (239: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
