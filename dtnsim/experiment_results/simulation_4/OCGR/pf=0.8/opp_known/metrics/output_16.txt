The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
513(1 to 6), 514(6 to 10), 515(9 to 4), 520(2 to 8), 521(5 to 12), 535(7 to 12), 536(10 to 9), 539(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(513: 160.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(513: 5), (514: 3), (515: 6), (520: 2), (521: 2), (535: 4), (536: 1), (539: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
