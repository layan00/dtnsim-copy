The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
517(1 to 6), 518(6 to 10), 519(9 to 4), 524(2 to 8), 527(5 to 12), 543(7 to 12), 544(10 to 9), 550(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(517: 3), (518: 3), (519: 6), (524: 2), (527: 2), (543: 6), (544: 2), (550: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
