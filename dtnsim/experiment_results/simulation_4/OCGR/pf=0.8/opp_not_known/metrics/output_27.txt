The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1029(1 to 6), 1030(6 to 10), 1031(9 to 4), 1036(2 to 8), 1051(5 to 12), 1078(7 to 12), 1079(10 to 9), 1081(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1029: 1), (1030: 6), (1031: 5), (1036: 2), (1051: 2), (1078: 2), (1079: 2), (1081: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
