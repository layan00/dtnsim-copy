The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1033(1 to 6), 1034(6 to 10), 1035(9 to 4), 1040(2 to 8), 1054(5 to 12), 1081(7 to 12), 1082(10 to 9), 1085(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1035: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1033: 1), (1034: 5), (1035: 5), (1040: 2), (1054: 2), (1081: 3), (1082: 1), (1085: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
