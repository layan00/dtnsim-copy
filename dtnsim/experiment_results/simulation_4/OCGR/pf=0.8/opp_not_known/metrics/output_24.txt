The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1886(1 to 6), 1887(6 to 10), 1888(9 to 4), 1892(2 to 8), 1907(5 to 12), 1934(7 to 12), 1935(10 to 9), 1938(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1888: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1886: 2), (1887: 3), (1888: 5), (1892: 2), (1907: 2), (1934: 3), (1935: 1), (1938: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1886: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
