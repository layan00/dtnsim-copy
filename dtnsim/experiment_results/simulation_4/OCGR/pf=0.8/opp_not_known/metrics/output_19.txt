The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1847(1 to 6), 1848(6 to 10), 1849(9 to 4), 1854(2 to 8), 1867(5 to 12), 1894(7 to 12), 1895(10 to 9), 1896(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1847: 1), (1848: 6), (1849: 6), (1854: 2), (1867: 2), (1894: 3), (1895: 1), (1896: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
