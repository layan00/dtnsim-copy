The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
640(1 to 6), 641(6 to 10), 642(9 to 4), 648(2 to 8), 665(5 to 12), 693(7 to 12), 694(10 to 9), 697(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(640: 3), (641: 5), (642: 6), (648: 3), (665: 3), (693: 3), (694: 1), (697: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
