The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(1 to 6), 655(6 to 10), 656(9 to 4), 659(2 to 8), 675(5 to 12), 703(7 to 12), 704(10 to 9), 707(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(656: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 1), (655: 4), (656: 5), (659: 3), (675: 2), (703: 3), (704: 1), (707: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
