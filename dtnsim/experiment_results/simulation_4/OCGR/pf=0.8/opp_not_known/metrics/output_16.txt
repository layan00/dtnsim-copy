The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
638(1 to 6), 639(6 to 10), 640(9 to 4), 645(2 to 8), 658(5 to 12), 684(7 to 12), 685(10 to 9), 686(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(638: 1), (639: 5), (640: 6), (645: 2), (658: 2), (684: 2), (685: 1), (686: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
