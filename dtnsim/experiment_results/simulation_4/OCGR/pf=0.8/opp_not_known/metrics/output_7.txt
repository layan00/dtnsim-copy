The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1050(1 to 6), 1051(6 to 10), 1052(9 to 4), 1057(2 to 8), 1071(5 to 12), 1098(7 to 12), 1099(10 to 9), 1100(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1050: 1), (1051: 5), (1052: 6), (1057: 2), (1071: 2), (1098: 2), (1099: 1), (1100: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
