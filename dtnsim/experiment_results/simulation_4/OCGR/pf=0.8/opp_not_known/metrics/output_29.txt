The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1866(1 to 6), 1867(6 to 10), 1868(9 to 4), 1874(2 to 8), 1892(5 to 12), 1919(7 to 12), 1920(10 to 9), 1921(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1874: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1866: 3), (1867: 5), (1868: 6), (1874: 2), (1892: 2), (1919: 2), (1920: 2), (1921: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
