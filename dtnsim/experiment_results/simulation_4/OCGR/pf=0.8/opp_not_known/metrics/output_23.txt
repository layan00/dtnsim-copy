The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1475(1 to 6), 1476(6 to 10), 1477(9 to 4), 1480(2 to 8), 1495(5 to 12), 1523(7 to 12), 1524(10 to 9), 1526(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1477: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1475: 1), (1476: 3), (1477: 6), (1480: 3), (1495: 2), (1523: 2), (1524: 1), (1526: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
