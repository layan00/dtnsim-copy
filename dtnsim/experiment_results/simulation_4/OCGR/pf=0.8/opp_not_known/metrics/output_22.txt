The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1059(1 to 6), 1060(6 to 10), 1061(9 to 4), 1066(2 to 8), 1080(5 to 12), 1108(7 to 12), 1109(10 to 9), 1112(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1061: 60.000000), (1066: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1059: 1), (1060: 5), (1061: 5), (1066: 3), (1080: 3), (1108: 2), (1109: 1), (1112: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
