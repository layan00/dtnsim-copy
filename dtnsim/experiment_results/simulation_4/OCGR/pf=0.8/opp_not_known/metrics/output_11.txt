The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
624(1 to 6), 625(6 to 10), 626(9 to 4), 631(2 to 8), 644(5 to 12), 669(7 to 12), 670(10 to 9), 671(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(626: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(624: 1), (625: 5), (626: 5), (631: 2), (644: 2), (669: 3), (670: 2), (671: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
