The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1851(1 to 6), 1852(6 to 10), 1853(9 to 4), 1857(2 to 8), 1874(5 to 12), 1900(7 to 12), 1901(10 to 9), 1903(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1853: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1851: 1), (1852: 3), (1853: 3), (1857: 3), (1874: 2), (1900: 3), (1901: 1), (1903: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
