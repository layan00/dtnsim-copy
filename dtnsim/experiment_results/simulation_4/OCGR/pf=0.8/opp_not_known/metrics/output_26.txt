The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
620(1 to 6), 621(6 to 10), 622(9 to 4), 627(2 to 8), 642(5 to 12), 671(7 to 12), 672(10 to 9), 676(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(620: 1), (621: 5), (622: 6), (627: 2), (642: 2), (671: 4), (672: 1), (676: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
