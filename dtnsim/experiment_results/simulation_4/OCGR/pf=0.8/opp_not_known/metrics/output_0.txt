The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(1 to 6), 229(6 to 10), 230(9 to 4), 233(2 to 8), 246(5 to 12), 275(7 to 12), 276(10 to 9), 283(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(230: 80.000000), (275: 0.000000), (283: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 1), (229: 4), (230: 5), (233: 3), (246: 2), (275: 6), (276: 1), (283: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
