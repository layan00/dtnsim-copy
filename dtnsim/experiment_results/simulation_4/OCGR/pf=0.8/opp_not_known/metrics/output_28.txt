The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1446(1 to 6), 1447(6 to 10), 1448(9 to 4), 1454(2 to 8), 1470(5 to 12), 1499(7 to 12), 1500(10 to 9), 1501(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1448: 0.000000), (1501: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1446: 1), (1447: 5), (1448: 3), (1454: 2), (1470: 2), (1499: 2), (1500: 1), (1501: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
