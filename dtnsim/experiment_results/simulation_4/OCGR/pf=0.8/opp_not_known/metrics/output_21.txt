The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
648(1 to 6), 649(6 to 10), 650(9 to 4), 655(2 to 8), 669(5 to 12), 697(7 to 12), 698(10 to 9), 702(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(648: 1), (649: 5), (650: 6), (655: 2), (669: 2), (697: 4), (698: 2), (702: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
