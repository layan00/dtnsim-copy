The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1455(1 to 6), 1456(6 to 10), 1457(9 to 4), 1463(2 to 8), 1476(5 to 12), 1504(7 to 12), 1505(10 to 9), 1509(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1457: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1455: 2), (1456: 5), (1457: 6), (1463: 2), (1476: 2), (1504: 4), (1505: 1), (1509: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
