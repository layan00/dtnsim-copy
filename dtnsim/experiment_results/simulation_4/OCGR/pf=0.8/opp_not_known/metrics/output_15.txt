The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
230(1 to 6), 231(6 to 10), 232(9 to 4), 235(2 to 8), 254(5 to 12), 280(7 to 12), 281(10 to 9), 287(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(230: 40.000000), (232: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(230: 3), (231: 5), (232: 5), (235: 3), (254: 3), (280: 2), (281: 3), (287: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
