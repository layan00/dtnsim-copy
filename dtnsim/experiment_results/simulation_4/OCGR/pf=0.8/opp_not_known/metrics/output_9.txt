The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1864(1 to 6), 1865(6 to 10), 1866(9 to 4), 1871(2 to 8), 1887(5 to 12), 1914(7 to 12), 1915(10 to 9), 1918(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1864: 1), (1865: 5), (1866: 5), (1871: 2), (1887: 2), (1914: 2), (1915: 1), (1918: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
