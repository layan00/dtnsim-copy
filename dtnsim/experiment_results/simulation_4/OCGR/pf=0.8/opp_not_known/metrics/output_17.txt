The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1030(1 to 6), 1031(6 to 10), 1032(9 to 4), 1037(2 to 8), 1051(5 to 12), 1077(7 to 12), 1078(10 to 9), 1079(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1032: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1030: 1), (1031: 5), (1032: 5), (1037: 2), (1051: 2), (1077: 2), (1078: 1), (1079: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1030: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
