The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
317(1 to 6), 318(6 to 10), 319(9 to 4), 321(2 to 8), 332(5 to 12), 341(7 to 12), 342(10 to 9), 347(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(317: 80.000000), (321: 0.000000), (332: 95.000000), (341: 80.000000), (342: 40.000000), (347: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(317: 4), (318: 4), (319: 4), (321: 2), (332: 5), (341: 3), (342: 4), (347: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
