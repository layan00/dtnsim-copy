The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
479(1 to 6), 480(6 to 10), 481(9 to 4), 483(2 to 8), 490(5 to 12), 497(7 to 12), 498(10 to 9), 502(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(483: 25.000000), (490: 95.000000), (497: 80.000000), (498: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(479: 1), (480: 5), (481: 5), (483: 3), (490: 5), (497: 3), (498: 4), (502: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
