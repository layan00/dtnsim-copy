The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
672(1 to 6), 673(6 to 10), 674(9 to 4), 679(2 to 8), 688(5 to 12), 700(7 to 12), 701(10 to 9), 708(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(672: 80.000000), (673: 160.000000), (674: 40.000000), (679: 125.000000), (688: 95.000000), (700: 80.000000), (701: 100.000000), (708: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(672: 4), (673: 5), (674: 5), (679: 7), (688: 4), (700: 3), (701: 5), (708: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
