The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
125(1 to 6), 126(6 to 10), 127(9 to 4), 132(2 to 8), 144(5 to 12), 155(7 to 12), 156(10 to 9), 160(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(125: 120.000000), (127: 40.000000), (132: 0.000000), (144: 95.000000), (155: 80.000000), (160: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(125: 5), (126: 5), (127: 5), (132: 2), (144: 4), (155: 3), (156: 2), (160: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
