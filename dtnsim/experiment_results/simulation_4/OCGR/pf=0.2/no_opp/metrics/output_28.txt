The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
724(1 to 6), 725(6 to 10), 726(9 to 4), 731(2 to 8), 738(5 to 12), 747(7 to 12), 748(10 to 9), 752(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(731: 0.000000), (748: 40.000000), (752: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(724: 2), (725: 3), (726: 5), (731: 2), (738: 3), (747: 2), (748: 4), (752: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
