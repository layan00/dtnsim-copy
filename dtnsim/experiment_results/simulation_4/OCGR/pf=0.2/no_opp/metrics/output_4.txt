The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
904(1 to 6), 905(6 to 10), 906(9 to 4), 911(2 to 8), 922(5 to 12), 929(7 to 12), 930(10 to 9), 933(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(904: 80.000000), (906: 40.000000), (911: 0.000000), (929: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(904: 4), (905: 3), (906: 5), (911: 2), (922: 2), (929: 4), (930: 3), (933: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
