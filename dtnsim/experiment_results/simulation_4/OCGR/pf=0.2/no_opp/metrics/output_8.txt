The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
718(1 to 6), 719(6 to 10), 720(9 to 4), 722(2 to 8), 730(5 to 12), 741(7 to 12), 742(10 to 9), 746(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(719: 160.000000), (720: 140.000000), (722: 0.000000), (730: 95.000000), (741: 80.000000), (742: 100.000000), (746: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(718: 2), (719: 5), (720: 5), (722: 2), (730: 4), (741: 3), (742: 5), (746: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
