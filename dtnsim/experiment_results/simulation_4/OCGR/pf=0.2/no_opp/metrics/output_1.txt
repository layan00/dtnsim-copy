The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
330(1 to 6), 331(6 to 10), 332(9 to 4), 337(2 to 8), 346(5 to 12), 355(7 to 12), 356(10 to 9), 361(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(330: 80.000000), (332: 40.000000), (337: 125.000000), (356: 40.000000), (361: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(330: 4), (331: 4), (332: 5), (337: 6), (346: 4), (355: 2), (356: 4), (361: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
