The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
520(1 to 6), 521(6 to 10), 522(9 to 4), 525(2 to 8), 534(5 to 12), 543(7 to 12), 544(10 to 9), 548(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(521: 160.000000), (522: 140.000000), (525: 0.000000), (534: 95.000000), (543: 80.000000), (548: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(520: 1), (521: 5), (522: 6), (525: 2), (534: 4), (543: 3), (544: 1), (548: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
