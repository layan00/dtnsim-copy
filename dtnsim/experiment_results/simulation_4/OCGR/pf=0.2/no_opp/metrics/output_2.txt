The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
526(1 to 6), 527(6 to 10), 528(9 to 4), 533(2 to 8), 540(5 to 12), 547(7 to 12), 548(10 to 9), 551(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 160.000000), (528: 140.000000), (533: 25.000000), (540: 95.000000), (547: 80.000000), (548: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(526: 2), (527: 6), (528: 6), (533: 3), (540: 4), (547: 3), (548: 5), (551: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
