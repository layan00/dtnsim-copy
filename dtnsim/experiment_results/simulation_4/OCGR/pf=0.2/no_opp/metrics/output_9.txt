The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
913(1 to 6), 914(6 to 10), 915(9 to 4), 917(2 to 8), 925(5 to 12), 936(7 to 12), 937(10 to 9), 942(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(917: 0.000000), (936: 80.000000), (942: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(913: 1), (914: 4), (915: 5), (917: 2), (925: 2), (936: 3), (937: 1), (942: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
