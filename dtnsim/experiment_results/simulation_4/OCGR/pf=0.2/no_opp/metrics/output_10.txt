The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
120(1 to 6), 121(6 to 10), 122(9 to 4), 125(2 to 8), 133(5 to 12), 143(7 to 12), 144(10 to 9), 150(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(122: 140.000000), (125: 25.000000), (133: 95.000000), (143: 80.000000), (144: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(120: 3), (121: 5), (122: 6), (125: 3), (133: 4), (143: 3), (144: 4), (150: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
