The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
325(1 to 6), 326(6 to 10), 327(9 to 4), 332(2 to 8), 343(5 to 12), 355(7 to 12), 356(10 to 9), 362(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(325: 80.000000), (326: 160.000000), (327: 40.000000), (332: 0.000000), (343: 95.000000), (355: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(325: 4), (326: 5), (327: 5), (332: 2), (343: 4), (355: 3), (356: 2), (362: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
