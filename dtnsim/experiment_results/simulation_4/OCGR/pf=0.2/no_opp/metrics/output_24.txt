The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
920(1 to 6), 921(6 to 10), 922(9 to 4), 927(2 to 8), 939(5 to 12), 951(7 to 12), 952(10 to 9), 958(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(920: 80.000000), (922: 40.000000), (927: 0.000000), (951: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(920: 4), (921: 5), (922: 5), (927: 2), (939: 2), (951: 3), (952: 3), (958: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
