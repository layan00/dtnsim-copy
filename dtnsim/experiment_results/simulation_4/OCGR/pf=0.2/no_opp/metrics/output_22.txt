The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
516(1 to 6), 517(6 to 10), 518(9 to 4), 521(2 to 8), 529(5 to 12), 538(7 to 12), 539(10 to 9), 543(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(516: 120.000000), (517: 160.000000), (518: 140.000000), (521: 0.000000), (529: 95.000000), (538: 80.000000), (539: 40.000000), (543: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(516: 5), (517: 6), (518: 6), (521: 2), (529: 5), (538: 3), (539: 4), (543: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
