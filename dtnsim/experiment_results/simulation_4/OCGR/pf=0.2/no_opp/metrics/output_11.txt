The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
304(1 to 6), 305(6 to 10), 306(9 to 4), 309(2 to 8), 314(5 to 12), 320(7 to 12), 321(10 to 9), 322(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(314: 95.000000), (320: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(304: 1), (305: 5), (306: 5), (309: 2), (314: 4), (320: 4), (321: 2), (322: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
