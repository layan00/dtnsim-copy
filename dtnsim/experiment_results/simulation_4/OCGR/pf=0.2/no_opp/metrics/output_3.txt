The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
720(1 to 6), 721(6 to 10), 722(9 to 4), 727(2 to 8), 734(5 to 12), 743(7 to 12), 744(10 to 9), 746(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(727: 0.000000), (734: 95.000000), (743: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(720: 2), (721: 5), (722: 5), (727: 2), (734: 4), (743: 4), (744: 1), (746: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
