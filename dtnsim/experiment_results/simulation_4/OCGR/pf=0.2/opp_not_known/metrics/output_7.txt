The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1274(1 to 6), 1275(6 to 10), 1276(9 to 4), 1284(2 to 8), 1306(5 to 12), 1339(7 to 12), 1340(10 to 9), 1346(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1274: 40.000000), (1275: 160.000000), (1276: 0.000000), (1284: 0.000000), (1306: 95.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1274: 3), (1275: 8), (1276: 3), (1284: 2), (1306: 4), (1339: 4), (1340: 1), (1346: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
