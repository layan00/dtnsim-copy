The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
268(1 to 6), 269(6 to 10), 270(9 to 4), 282(2 to 8), 302(5 to 12), 337(7 to 12), 338(10 to 9), 347(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(268: 40.000000), (269: 0.000000), (270: 0.000000), (282: 0.000000), (337: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(268: 3), (269: 8), (270: 3), (282: 2), (302: 4), (337: 6), (338: 2), (347: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
