The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
775(1 to 6), 776(6 to 10), 777(9 to 4), 785(2 to 8), 807(5 to 12), 842(7 to 12), 843(10 to 9), 852(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(775: 40.000000), (777: 0.000000), (785: 0.000000), (842: 0.000000), (843: 40.000000), (852: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(775: 3), (776: 7), (777: 3), (785: 2), (807: 6), (842: 6), (843: 4), (852: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
