The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
273(1 to 6), 274(6 to 10), 275(9 to 4), 287(2 to 8), 307(5 to 12), 341(7 to 12), 342(10 to 9), 349(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(274: 0.000000), (275: 0.000000), (287: 0.000000), (341: 0.000000), (342: 40.000000), (349: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(273: 1), (274: 8), (275: 3), (287: 2), (307: 4), (341: 6), (342: 4), (349: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
