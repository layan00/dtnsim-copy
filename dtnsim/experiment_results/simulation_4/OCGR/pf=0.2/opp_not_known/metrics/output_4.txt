The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2281(1 to 6), 2282(6 to 10), 2283(9 to 4), 2295(2 to 8), 2317(5 to 12), 2348(7 to 12), 2349(10 to 9), 2355(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2281: 40.000000), (2282: 0.000000), (2283: 0.000000), (2295: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2281: 3), (2282: 8), (2283: 3), (2295: 2), (2317: 2), (2348: 4), (2349: 3), (2355: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
