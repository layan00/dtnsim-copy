The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
264(1 to 6), 265(6 to 10), 266(9 to 4), 273(2 to 8), 292(5 to 12), 326(7 to 12), 327(10 to 9), 336(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(264: 80.000000), (265: 100.000000), (266: 0.000000), (273: 25.000000), (326: 0.000000), (327: 40.000000), (336: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(264: 4), (265: 11), (266: 3), (273: 3), (292: 6), (326: 6), (327: 4), (336: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 44 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
