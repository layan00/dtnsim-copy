The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
755(1 to 6), 756(6 to 10), 757(9 to 4), 764(2 to 8), 785(5 to 12), 818(7 to 12), 819(10 to 9), 824(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(755: 80.000000), (757: 0.000000), (764: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(755: 4), (756: 8), (757: 3), (764: 2), (785: 2), (818: 4), (819: 3), (824: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
