The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
261(1 to 6), 262(6 to 10), 263(9 to 4), 275(2 to 8), 283(5 to 12), 305(7 to 12), 306(10 to 9), 313(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 80.000000), (262: 0.000000), (263: 0.000000), (275: 0.000000), (283: 95.000000), (305: 0.000000), (306: 40.000000), (313: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(261: 4), (262: 8), (263: 3), (275: 2), (283: 5), (305: 6), (306: 4), (313: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
