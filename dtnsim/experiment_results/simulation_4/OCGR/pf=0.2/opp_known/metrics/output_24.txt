The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1810(1 to 6), 1811(6 to 10), 1812(9 to 4), 1824(2 to 8), 1835(5 to 12), 1859(7 to 12), 1860(10 to 9), 1869(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1810: 40.000000), (1811: 0.000000), (1812: 0.000000), (1824: 0.000000), (1859: 0.000000), (1860: 80.000000), (1869: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1810: 3), (1811: 8), (1812: 3), (1824: 2), (1835: 2), (1859: 6), (1860: 6), (1869: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
