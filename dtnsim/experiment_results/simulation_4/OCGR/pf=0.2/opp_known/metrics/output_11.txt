The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
625(1 to 6), 626(6 to 10), 627(9 to 4), 635(2 to 8), 642(5 to 12), 660(7 to 12), 661(10 to 9), 668(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(625: 40.000000), (626: 100.000000), (627: 0.000000), (642: 95.000000), (660: 80.000000), (668: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(625: 3), (626: 14), (627: 3), (635: 2), (642: 4), (660: 7), (661: 2), (668: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
