The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
714(1 to 6), 715(6 to 10), 716(9 to 4), 722(2 to 8), 741(5 to 12), 772(7 to 12), 773(10 to 9), 777(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(716: 0.000000), (722: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(714: 1), (715: 5), (716: 3), (722: 2), (741: 2), (772: 4), (773: 3), (777: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
