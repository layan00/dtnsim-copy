The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
253(1 to 6), 254(6 to 10), 255(9 to 4), 261(2 to 8), 278(5 to 12), 312(7 to 12), 313(10 to 9), 318(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 1), (254: 7), (255: 5), (261: 3), (278: 3), (312: 3), (313: 2), (318: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 45 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
