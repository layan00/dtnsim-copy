The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1706(1 to 6), 1707(6 to 10), 1708(9 to 4), 1715(2 to 8), 1735(5 to 12), 1767(7 to 12), 1768(10 to 9), 1769(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1708: 0.000000), (1715: 0.000000), (1769: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1706: 3), (1707: 5), (1708: 3), (1715: 2), (1735: 2), (1767: 3), (1768: 2), (1769: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
