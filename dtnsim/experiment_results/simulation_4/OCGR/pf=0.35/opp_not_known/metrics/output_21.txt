The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
744(1 to 6), 745(6 to 10), 746(9 to 4), 754(2 to 8), 772(5 to 12), 805(7 to 12), 806(10 to 9), 815(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(744: 40.000000), (746: 0.000000), (805: 0.000000), (806: 40.000000), (815: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(744: 3), (745: 7), (746: 3), (754: 3), (772: 7), (805: 6), (806: 4), (815: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
