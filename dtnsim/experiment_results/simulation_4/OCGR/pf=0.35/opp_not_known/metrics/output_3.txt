The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1695(1 to 6), 1696(6 to 10), 1697(9 to 4), 1703(2 to 8), 1723(5 to 12), 1755(7 to 12), 1756(10 to 9), 1760(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1697: 120.000000), (1703: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1695: 3), (1696: 5), (1697: 6), (1703: 2), (1723: 3), (1755: 4), (1756: 1), (1760: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
