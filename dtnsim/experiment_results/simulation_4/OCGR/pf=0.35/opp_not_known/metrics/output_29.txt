The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2180(1 to 6), 2181(6 to 10), 2182(9 to 4), 2189(2 to 8), 2212(5 to 12), 2244(7 to 12), 2245(10 to 9), 2252(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2182: 0.000000), (2189: 0.000000), (2244: 0.000000), (2252: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2180: 3), (2181: 5), (2182: 3), (2189: 2), (2212: 2), (2244: 6), (2245: 2), (2252: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
