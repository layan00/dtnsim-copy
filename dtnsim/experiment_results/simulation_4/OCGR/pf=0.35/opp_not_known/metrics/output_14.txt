The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2149(1 to 6), 2150(6 to 10), 2151(9 to 4), 2159(2 to 8), 2178(5 to 12), 2209(7 to 12), 2210(10 to 9), 2217(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2149: 120.000000), (2151: 0.000000), (2159: 125.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2149: 5), (2150: 6), (2151: 3), (2159: 6), (2178: 2), (2209: 4), (2210: 1), (2217: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
