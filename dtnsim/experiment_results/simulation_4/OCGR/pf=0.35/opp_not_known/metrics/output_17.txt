The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1171(1 to 6), 1172(6 to 10), 1173(9 to 4), 1178(2 to 8), 1197(5 to 12), 1230(7 to 12), 1231(10 to 9), 1238(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1173: 80.000000), (1178: 0.000000), (1230: 0.000000), (1238: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1171: 1), (1172: 5), (1173: 5), (1178: 2), (1197: 3), (1230: 6), (1231: 1), (1238: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
