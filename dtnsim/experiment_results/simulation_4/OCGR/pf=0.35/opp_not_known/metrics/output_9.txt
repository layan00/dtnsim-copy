The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2144(1 to 6), 2145(6 to 10), 2146(9 to 4), 2153(2 to 8), 2173(5 to 12), 2207(7 to 12), 2208(10 to 9), 2213(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2146: 0.000000), (2153: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2144: 1), (2145: 12), (2146: 3), (2153: 2), (2173: 2), (2207: 4), (2208: 1), (2213: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
