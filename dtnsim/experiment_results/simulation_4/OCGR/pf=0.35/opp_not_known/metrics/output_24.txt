The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2197(1 to 6), 2198(6 to 10), 2199(9 to 4), 2206(2 to 8), 2224(5 to 12), 2258(7 to 12), 2259(10 to 9), 2265(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2197: 80.000000), (2199: 0.000000), (2206: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2197: 4), (2198: 7), (2199: 3), (2206: 3), (2224: 2), (2258: 4), (2259: 3), (2265: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
