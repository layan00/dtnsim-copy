The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1672(1 to 6), 1673(6 to 10), 1674(9 to 4), 1681(2 to 8), 1696(5 to 12), 1728(7 to 12), 1729(10 to 9), 1736(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1674: 0.000000), (1728: 0.000000), (1736: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1672: 2), (1673: 5), (1674: 3), (1681: 2), (1696: 3), (1728: 6), (1729: 3), (1736: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
