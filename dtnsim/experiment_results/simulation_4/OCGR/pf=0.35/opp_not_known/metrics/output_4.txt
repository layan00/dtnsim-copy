The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2162(1 to 6), 2163(6 to 10), 2164(9 to 4), 2176(2 to 8), 2198(5 to 12), 2229(7 to 12), 2230(10 to 9), 2236(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2162: 40.000000), (2163: 0.000000), (2164: 0.000000), (2176: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2162: 3), (2163: 8), (2164: 3), (2176: 2), (2198: 2), (2229: 4), (2230: 1), (2236: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
