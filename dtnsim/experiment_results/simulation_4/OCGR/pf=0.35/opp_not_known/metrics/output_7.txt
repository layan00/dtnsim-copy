The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1206(1 to 6), 1207(6 to 10), 1208(9 to 4), 1216(2 to 8), 1236(5 to 12), 1265(7 to 12), 1266(10 to 9), 1269(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1206: 40.000000), (1208: 0.000000), (1216: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1206: 3), (1207: 8), (1208: 3), (1216: 2), (1236: 2), (1265: 2), (1266: 1), (1269: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
