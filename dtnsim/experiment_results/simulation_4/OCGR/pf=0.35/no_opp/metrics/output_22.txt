The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
458(1 to 6), 459(6 to 10), 460(9 to 4), 462(2 to 8), 468(5 to 12), 476(7 to 12), 477(10 to 9), 480(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(460: 140.000000), (462: 0.000000), (468: 95.000000), (476: 80.000000), (480: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(458: 1), (459: 6), (460: 6), (462: 2), (468: 5), (476: 3), (477: 1), (480: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
