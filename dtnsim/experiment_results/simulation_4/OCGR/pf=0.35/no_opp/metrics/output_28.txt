The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
643(1 to 6), 644(6 to 10), 645(9 to 4), 647(2 to 8), 655(5 to 12), 663(7 to 12), 664(10 to 9), 666(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(647: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(643: 2), (644: 4), (645: 3), (647: 2), (655: 2), (663: 3), (664: 2), (666: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
