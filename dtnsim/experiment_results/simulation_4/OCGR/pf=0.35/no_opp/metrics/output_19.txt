The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
753(1 to 6), 754(6 to 10), 755(9 to 4), 758(2 to 8), 765(5 to 12), 772(7 to 12), 773(10 to 9), 775(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(758: 125.000000), (775: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(753: 1), (754: 3), (755: 4), (758: 6), (765: 4), (772: 3), (773: 1), (775: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
