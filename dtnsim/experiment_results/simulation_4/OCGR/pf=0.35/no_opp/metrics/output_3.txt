The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
641(1 to 6), 642(6 to 10), 643(9 to 4), 645(2 to 8), 653(5 to 12), 661(7 to 12), 662(10 to 9), 664(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(645: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(641: 2), (642: 4), (643: 3), (645: 2), (653: 3), (661: 3), (662: 1), (664: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
