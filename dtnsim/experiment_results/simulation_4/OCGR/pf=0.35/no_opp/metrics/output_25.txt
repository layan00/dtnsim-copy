The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
117(1 to 6), 118(6 to 10), 119(9 to 4), 124(2 to 8), 136(5 to 12), 144(7 to 12), 145(10 to 9), 148(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(117: 120.000000), (119: 40.000000), (124: 0.000000), (148: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(117: 5), (118: 4), (119: 5), (124: 2), (136: 3), (144: 3), (145: 2), (148: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
