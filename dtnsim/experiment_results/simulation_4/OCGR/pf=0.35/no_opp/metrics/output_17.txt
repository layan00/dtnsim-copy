The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
422(1 to 6), 423(6 to 10), 424(9 to 4), 425(2 to 8), 432(5 to 12), 441(7 to 12), 442(10 to 9), 444(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(425: 0.000000), (444: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(422: 1), (423: 4), (424: 3), (425: 2), (432: 3), (441: 2), (442: 1), (444: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
