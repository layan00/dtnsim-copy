The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
276(1 to 6), 277(6 to 10), 278(9 to 4), 280(2 to 8), 291(5 to 12), 299(7 to 12), 300(10 to 9), 304(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(280: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(276: 3), (277: 4), (278: 4), (280: 2), (291: 3), (299: 3), (300: 3), (304: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
