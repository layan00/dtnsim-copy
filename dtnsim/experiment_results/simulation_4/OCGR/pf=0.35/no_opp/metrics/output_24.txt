The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
817(1 to 6), 818(6 to 10), 819(9 to 4), 822(2 to 8), 828(5 to 12), 838(7 to 12), 839(10 to 9), 845(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(822: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(817: 2), (818: 4), (819: 5), (822: 3), (828: 2), (838: 3), (839: 3), (845: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
