The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
294(1 to 6), 295(6 to 10), 296(9 to 4), 299(2 to 8), 307(5 to 12), 317(7 to 12), 318(10 to 9), 320(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(296: 140.000000), (299: 0.000000), (317: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(294: 1), (295: 3), (296: 6), (299: 2), (307: 2), (317: 3), (318: 2), (320: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
