The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
637(1 to 6), 638(6 to 10), 639(9 to 4), 644(2 to 8), 651(5 to 12), 659(7 to 12), 660(10 to 9), 666(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(637: 80.000000), (638: 160.000000), (639: 40.000000), (644: 0.000000), (659: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(637: 4), (638: 5), (639: 5), (644: 2), (651: 3), (659: 3), (660: 1), (666: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
