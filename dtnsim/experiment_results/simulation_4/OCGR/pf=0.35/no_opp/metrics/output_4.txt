The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
805(1 to 6), 806(6 to 10), 807(9 to 4), 812(2 to 8), 823(5 to 12), 830(7 to 12), 831(10 to 9), 834(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(805: 80.000000), (807: 40.000000), (812: 0.000000), (830: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(805: 4), (806: 3), (807: 5), (812: 2), (823: 2), (830: 4), (831: 1), (834: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
