The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
312(1 to 6), 313(6 to 10), 314(9 to 4), 319(2 to 8), 327(5 to 12), 335(7 to 12), 336(10 to 9), 341(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(312: 80.000000), (314: 40.000000), (319: 125.000000), (341: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(312: 4), (313: 4), (314: 5), (319: 6), (327: 2), (335: 2), (336: 2), (341: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
