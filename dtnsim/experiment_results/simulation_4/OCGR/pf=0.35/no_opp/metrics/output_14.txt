The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
788(1 to 6), 789(6 to 10), 790(9 to 4), 793(2 to 8), 800(5 to 12), 807(7 to 12), 808(10 to 9), 815(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(788: 120.000000), (789: 160.000000), (793: 125.000000), (815: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(788: 5), (789: 5), (790: 6), (793: 6), (800: 2), (807: 3), (808: 1), (815: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
