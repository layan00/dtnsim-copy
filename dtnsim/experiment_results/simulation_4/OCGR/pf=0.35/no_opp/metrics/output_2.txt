The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
479(1 to 6), 480(6 to 10), 481(9 to 4), 484(2 to 8), 489(5 to 12), 495(7 to 12), 496(10 to 9), 499(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(481: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(479: 2), (480: 6), (481: 6), (484: 2), (489: 4), (495: 3), (496: 2), (499: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
