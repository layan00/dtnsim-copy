The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
810(1 to 6), 811(6 to 10), 812(9 to 4), 814(2 to 8), 825(5 to 12), 833(7 to 12), 834(10 to 9), 836(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(814: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(810: 3), (811: 3), (812: 3), (814: 2), (825: 2), (833: 2), (834: 2), (836: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 810: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 812: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
