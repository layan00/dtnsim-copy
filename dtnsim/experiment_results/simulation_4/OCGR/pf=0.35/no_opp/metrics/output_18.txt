The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
585(1 to 6), 586(6 to 10), 587(9 to 4), 590(2 to 8), 597(5 to 12), 607(7 to 12), 608(10 to 9), 611(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(597: 95.000000), (607: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(585: 2), (586: 4), (587: 5), (590: 2), (597: 4), (607: 3), (608: 2), (611: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
