The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
445(1 to 6), 446(6 to 10), 447(9 to 4), 449(2 to 8), 454(5 to 12), 461(7 to 12), 462(10 to 9), 466(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(445: 1), (446: 4), (447: 4), (449: 7), (454: 4), (461: 2), (462: 1), (466: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
