The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
109(1 to 6), 110(6 to 10), 111(9 to 4), 116(2 to 8), 125(5 to 12), 127(7 to 12), 128(10 to 9), 130(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(111: 140.000000), (128: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(109: 3), (110: 4), (111: 6), (116: 3), (125: 4), (127: 3), (128: 4), (130: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
