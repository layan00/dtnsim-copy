The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
119(1 to 6), 120(6 to 10), 121(9 to 4), 126(2 to 8), 135(5 to 12), 144(7 to 12), 145(10 to 9), 149(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(119: 80.000000), (121: 40.000000), (126: 0.000000), (135: 95.000000), (145: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(119: 4), (120: 3), (121: 5), (126: 2), (135: 5), (144: 2), (145: 4), (149: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
