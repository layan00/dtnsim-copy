The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
614(1 to 6), 615(6 to 10), 616(9 to 4), 621(2 to 8), 629(5 to 12), 638(7 to 12), 639(10 to 9), 641(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(615: 160.000000), (616: 140.000000), (629: 95.000000), (638: 80.000000), (639: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(614: 3), (615: 6), (616: 6), (621: 3), (629: 4), (638: 4), (639: 5), (641: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
