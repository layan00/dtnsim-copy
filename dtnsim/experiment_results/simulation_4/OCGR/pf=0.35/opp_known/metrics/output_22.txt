The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
985(1 to 6), 986(6 to 10), 987(9 to 4), 993(2 to 8), 999(5 to 12), 1019(7 to 12), 1020(10 to 9), 1031(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(985: 80.000000), (986: 40.000000), (987: 80.000000), (993: 0.000000), (999: 95.000000), (1019: 0.000000), (1031: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(985: 4), (986: 8), (987: 5), (993: 2), (999: 5), (1019: 6), (1020: 1), (1031: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
