The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
241(1 to 6), 242(6 to 10), 243(9 to 4), 249(2 to 8), 255(5 to 12), 277(7 to 12), 278(10 to 9), 288(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 40.000000), (242: 100.000000), (243: 140.000000), (277: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(241: 3), (242: 9), (243: 9), (249: 3), (255: 3), (277: 7), (278: 2), (288: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 44 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
