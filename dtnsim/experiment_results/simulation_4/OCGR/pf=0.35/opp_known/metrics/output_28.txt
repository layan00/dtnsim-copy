The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1332(1 to 6), 1333(6 to 10), 1334(9 to 4), 1340(2 to 8), 1348(5 to 12), 1368(7 to 12), 1369(10 to 9), 1374(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1332: 40.000000), (1334: 0.000000), (1340: 0.000000), (1368: 80.000000), (1374: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1332: 3), (1333: 3), (1334: 3), (1340: 2), (1348: 2), (1368: 7), (1369: 2), (1374: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
