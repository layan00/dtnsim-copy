The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1287(1 to 6), 1288(6 to 10), 1289(9 to 4), 1296(2 to 8), 1304(5 to 12), 1326(7 to 12), 1327(10 to 9), 1340(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1287: 40.000000), (1288: 40.000000), (1289: 0.000000), (1304: 95.000000), (1326: 0.000000), (1340: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1287: 3), (1288: 8), (1289: 3), (1296: 2), (1304: 4), (1326: 6), (1327: 2), (1340: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
