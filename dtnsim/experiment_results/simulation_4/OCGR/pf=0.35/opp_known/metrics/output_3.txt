The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1325(1 to 6), 1326(6 to 10), 1327(9 to 4), 1332(2 to 8), 1340(5 to 12), 1360(7 to 12), 1361(10 to 9), 1372(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1325: 40.000000), (1327: 40.000000), (1332: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1325: 3), (1326: 3), (1327: 8), (1332: 2), (1340: 3), (1360: 6), (1361: 1), (1372: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
