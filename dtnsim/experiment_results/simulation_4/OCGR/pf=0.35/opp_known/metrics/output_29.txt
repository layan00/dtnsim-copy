The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1691(1 to 6), 1692(6 to 10), 1693(9 to 4), 1699(2 to 8), 1709(5 to 12), 1729(7 to 12), 1730(10 to 9), 1739(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1691: 40.000000), (1693: 0.000000), (1699: 0.000000), (1729: 0.000000), (1739: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1691: 3), (1692: 3), (1693: 3), (1699: 2), (1709: 2), (1729: 6), (1730: 2), (1739: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
