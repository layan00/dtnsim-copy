The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1676(1 to 6), 1677(6 to 10), 1678(9 to 4), 1690(2 to 8), 1700(5 to 12), 1719(7 to 12), 1720(10 to 9), 1726(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1676: 40.000000), (1677: 0.000000), (1678: 0.000000), (1690: 0.000000), (1719: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1676: 3), (1677: 8), (1678: 3), (1690: 2), (1700: 2), (1719: 7), (1720: 1), (1726: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
