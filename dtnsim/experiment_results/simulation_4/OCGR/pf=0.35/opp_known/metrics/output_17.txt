The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
933(1 to 6), 934(6 to 10), 935(9 to 4), 940(2 to 8), 947(5 to 12), 968(7 to 12), 969(10 to 9), 976(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(933: 80.000000), (935: 80.000000), (940: 0.000000), (968: 0.000000), (976: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(933: 4), (934: 3), (935: 5), (940: 2), (947: 3), (968: 6), (969: 1), (976: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
