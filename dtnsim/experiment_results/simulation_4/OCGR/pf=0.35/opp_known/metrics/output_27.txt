The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
972(1 to 6), 973(6 to 10), 974(9 to 4), 979(2 to 8), 989(5 to 12), 1008(7 to 12), 1009(10 to 9), 1015(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(972: 40.000000), (974: 80.000000), (989: 95.000000), (1008: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(972: 3), (973: 3), (974: 5), (979: 3), (989: 4), (1008: 7), (1009: 2), (1015: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
