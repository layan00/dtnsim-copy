The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
587(1 to 6), 588(6 to 10), 589(9 to 4), 595(2 to 8), 602(5 to 12), 621(7 to 12), 622(10 to 9), 626(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(587: 160.000000), (589: 0.000000), (595: 0.000000), (621: 80.000000), (622: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(587: 5), (588: 3), (589: 3), (595: 2), (602: 2), (621: 7), (622: 6), (626: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
