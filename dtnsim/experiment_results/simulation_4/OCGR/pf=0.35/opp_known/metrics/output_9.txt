The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1687(1 to 6), 1688(6 to 10), 1689(9 to 4), 1696(2 to 8), 1705(5 to 12), 1727(7 to 12), 1728(10 to 9), 1737(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1687: 40.000000), (1689: 0.000000), (1696: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1687: 3), (1688: 10), (1689: 3), (1696: 2), (1705: 2), (1727: 6), (1728: 1), (1737: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
