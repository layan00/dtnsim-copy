The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
605(1 to 6), 606(6 to 10), 607(9 to 4), 615(2 to 8), 618(5 to 12), 635(7 to 12), 636(10 to 9), 639(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(605: 160.000000), (606: 120.000000), (607: 0.000000), (618: 95.000000), (635: 80.000000), (639: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(605: 5), (606: 11), (607: 3), (615: 2), (618: 4), (635: 7), (636: 2), (639: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
