The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
242(1 to 6), 243(6 to 10), 244(9 to 4), 250(2 to 8), 256(5 to 12), 276(7 to 12), 277(10 to 9), 286(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 80.000000), (244: 140.000000), (250: 25.000000), (256: 95.000000), (277: 40.000000), (286: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(242: 4), (243: 10), (244: 9), (250: 3), (256: 4), (276: 6), (277: 4), (286: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
