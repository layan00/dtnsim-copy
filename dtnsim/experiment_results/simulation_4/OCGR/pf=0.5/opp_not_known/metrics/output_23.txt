The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1640(1 to 6), 1641(6 to 10), 1642(9 to 4), 1653(2 to 8), 1671(5 to 12), 1701(7 to 12), 1702(10 to 9), 1706(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1640: 40.000000), (1641: 0.000000), (1642: 120.000000), (1653: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1640: 3), (1641: 8), (1642: 6), (1653: 2), (1671: 2), (1701: 3), (1702: 1), (1706: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
