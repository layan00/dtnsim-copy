The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2051(1 to 6), 2052(6 to 10), 2053(9 to 4), 2059(2 to 8), 2080(5 to 12), 2110(7 to 12), 2111(10 to 9), 2115(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2051: 80.000000), (2053: 80.000000), (2059: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2051: 4), (2052: 5), (2053: 5), (2059: 2), (2080: 2), (2110: 3), (2111: 1), (2115: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
