The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1585(1 to 6), 1586(6 to 10), 1587(9 to 4), 1592(2 to 8), 1611(5 to 12), 1644(7 to 12), 1645(10 to 9), 1652(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1587: 0.000000), (1644: 0.000000), (1652: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1585: 3), (1586: 4), (1587: 3), (1592: 3), (1611: 2), (1644: 6), (1645: 1), (1652: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
