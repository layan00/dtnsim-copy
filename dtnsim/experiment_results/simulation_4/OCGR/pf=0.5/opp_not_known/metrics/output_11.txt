The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
704(1 to 6), 705(6 to 10), 706(9 to 4), 710(2 to 8), 724(5 to 12), 750(7 to 12), 751(10 to 9), 754(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(706: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(704: 1), (705: 4), (706: 3), (710: 2), (724: 2), (750: 3), (751: 2), (754: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
