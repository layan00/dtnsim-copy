The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1145(1 to 6), 1146(6 to 10), 1147(9 to 4), 1153(2 to 8), 1168(5 to 12), 1198(7 to 12), 1199(10 to 9), 1203(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1147: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1145: 1), (1146: 7), (1147: 5), (1153: 2), (1168: 2), (1198: 5), (1199: 1), (1203: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
