The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
243(1 to 6), 244(6 to 10), 245(9 to 4), 252(2 to 8), 272(5 to 12), 302(7 to 12), 303(10 to 9), 309(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(245: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 5), (244: 5), (245: 3), (252: 4), (272: 2), (302: 4), (303: 2), (309: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
