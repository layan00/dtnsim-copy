The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
243(1 to 6), 244(6 to 10), 245(9 to 4), 249(2 to 8), 269(5 to 12), 295(7 to 12), 296(10 to 9), 302(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 40.000000), (244: 100.000000), (245: 0.000000), (296: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 3), (244: 6), (245: 3), (249: 3), (269: 4), (295: 3), (296: 4), (302: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
