The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1148(1 to 6), 1149(6 to 10), 1150(9 to 4), 1155(2 to 8), 1174(5 to 12), 1202(7 to 12), 1203(10 to 9), 1205(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1148: 1), (1149: 6), (1150: 5), (1155: 2), (1174: 2), (1202: 2), (1203: 2), (1205: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
