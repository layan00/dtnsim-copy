The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1129(1 to 6), 1130(6 to 10), 1131(9 to 4), 1136(2 to 8), 1154(5 to 12), 1186(7 to 12), 1187(10 to 9), 1194(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1131: 80.000000), (1136: 0.000000), (1186: 0.000000), (1194: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1129: 1), (1130: 5), (1131: 5), (1136: 2), (1154: 3), (1186: 6), (1187: 1), (1194: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
