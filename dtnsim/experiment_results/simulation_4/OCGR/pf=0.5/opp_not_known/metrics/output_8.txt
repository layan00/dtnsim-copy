The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1585(1 to 6), 1586(6 to 10), 1587(9 to 4), 1593(2 to 8), 1607(5 to 12), 1638(7 to 12), 1639(10 to 9), 1644(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1585: 2), (1586: 7), (1587: 5), (1593: 2), (1607: 2), (1638: 4), (1639: 2), (1644: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
