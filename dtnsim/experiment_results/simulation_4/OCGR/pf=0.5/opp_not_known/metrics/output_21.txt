The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
720(1 to 6), 721(6 to 10), 722(9 to 4), 728(2 to 8), 746(5 to 12), 776(7 to 12), 777(10 to 9), 784(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(722: 0.000000), (776: 0.000000), (777: 40.000000), (784: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(720: 1), (721: 6), (722: 3), (728: 3), (746: 5), (776: 6), (777: 4), (784: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
