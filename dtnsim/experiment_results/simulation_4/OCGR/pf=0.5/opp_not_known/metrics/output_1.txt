The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
725(1 to 6), 726(6 to 10), 727(9 to 4), 730(2 to 8), 748(5 to 12), 778(7 to 12), 779(10 to 9), 786(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(725: 40.000000), (727: 80.000000), (730: 125.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(725: 3), (726: 3), (727: 5), (730: 6), (748: 2), (778: 4), (779: 1), (786: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
