The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1144(1 to 6), 1145(6 to 10), 1146(9 to 4), 1153(2 to 8), 1173(5 to 12), 1201(7 to 12), 1202(10 to 9), 1205(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1144: 40.000000), (1146: 120.000000), (1153: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1144: 3), (1145: 6), (1146: 6), (1153: 2), (1173: 2), (1201: 2), (1202: 1), (1205: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
