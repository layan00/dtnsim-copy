The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2062(1 to 6), 2063(6 to 10), 2064(9 to 4), 2072(2 to 8), 2091(5 to 12), 2121(7 to 12), 2122(10 to 9), 2127(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2062: 120.000000), (2064: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2062: 5), (2063: 6), (2064: 3), (2072: 6), (2091: 2), (2121: 3), (2122: 1), (2127: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
