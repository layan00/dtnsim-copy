The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1606(1 to 6), 1607(6 to 10), 1608(9 to 4), 1614(2 to 8), 1630(5 to 12), 1660(7 to 12), 1661(10 to 9), 1662(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1606: 2), (1607: 5), (1608: 6), (1614: 2), (1630: 3), (1660: 3), (1661: 1), (1662: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
