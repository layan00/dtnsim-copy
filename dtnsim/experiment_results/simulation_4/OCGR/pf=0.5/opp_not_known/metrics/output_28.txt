The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1600(1 to 6), 1601(6 to 10), 1602(9 to 4), 1609(2 to 8), 1627(5 to 12), 1659(7 to 12), 1660(10 to 9), 1662(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1602: 0.000000), (1609: 25.000000), (1662: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1600: 3), (1601: 5), (1602: 3), (1609: 3), (1627: 2), (1659: 3), (1660: 1), (1662: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
