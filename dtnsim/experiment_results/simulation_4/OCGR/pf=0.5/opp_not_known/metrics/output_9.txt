The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2029(1 to 6), 2030(6 to 10), 2031(9 to 4), 2037(2 to 8), 2056(5 to 12), 2089(7 to 12), 2090(10 to 9), 2094(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2031: 0.000000), (2037: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2029: 1), (2030: 5), (2031: 3), (2037: 2), (2056: 2), (2089: 4), (2090: 1), (2094: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
