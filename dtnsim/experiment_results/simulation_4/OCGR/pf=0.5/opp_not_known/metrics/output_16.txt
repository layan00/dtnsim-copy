The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
689(1 to 6), 690(6 to 10), 691(9 to 4), 697(2 to 8), 715(5 to 12), 743(7 to 12), 744(10 to 9), 746(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(691: 0.000000), (697: 0.000000), (743: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(689: 1), (690: 5), (691: 3), (697: 2), (715: 3), (743: 3), (744: 3), (746: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
