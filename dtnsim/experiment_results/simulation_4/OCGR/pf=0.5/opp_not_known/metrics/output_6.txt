The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
693(1 to 6), 694(6 to 10), 695(9 to 4), 701(2 to 8), 722(5 to 12), 751(7 to 12), 752(10 to 9), 755(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(695: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(693: 3), (694: 6), (695: 5), (701: 3), (722: 3), (751: 3), (752: 3), (755: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
