The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1166(1 to 6), 1167(6 to 10), 1168(9 to 4), 1174(2 to 8), 1189(5 to 12), 1216(7 to 12), 1217(10 to 9), 1220(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1168: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1166: 1), (1167: 9), (1168: 5), (1174: 2), (1189: 2), (1216: 3), (1217: 2), (1220: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
