The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2043(1 to 6), 2044(6 to 10), 2045(9 to 4), 2050(2 to 8), 2068(5 to 12), 2099(7 to 12), 2100(10 to 9), 2107(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2045: 120.000000), (2099: 0.000000), (2107: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2043: 1), (2044: 5), (2045: 6), (2050: 3), (2068: 3), (2099: 6), (2100: 1), (2107: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
