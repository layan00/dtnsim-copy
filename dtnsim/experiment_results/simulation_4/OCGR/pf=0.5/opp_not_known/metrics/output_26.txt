The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
695(1 to 6), 696(6 to 10), 697(9 to 4), 704(2 to 8), 725(5 to 12), 757(7 to 12), 758(10 to 9), 764(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(695: 40.000000), (696: 160.000000), (697: 80.000000), (704: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(695: 3), (696: 8), (697: 5), (704: 2), (725: 2), (757: 4), (758: 2), (764: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
