The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2097(1 to 6), 2098(6 to 10), 2099(9 to 4), 2105(2 to 8), 2122(5 to 12), 2155(7 to 12), 2156(10 to 9), 2163(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2097: 80.000000), (2099: 60.000000), (2105: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2097: 4), (2098: 7), (2099: 5), (2105: 3), (2122: 3), (2155: 4), (2156: 1), (2163: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
