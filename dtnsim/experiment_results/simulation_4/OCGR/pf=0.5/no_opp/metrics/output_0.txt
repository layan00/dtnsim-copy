The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
114(1 to 6), 115(6 to 10), 116(9 to 4), 121(2 to 8), 130(5 to 12), 136(7 to 12), 137(10 to 9), 140(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(114: 120.000000), (115: 160.000000), (116: 40.000000), (121: 0.000000), (140: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(114: 5), (115: 6), (116: 5), (121: 2), (130: 5), (136: 2), (137: 1), (140: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
