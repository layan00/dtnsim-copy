The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
663(1 to 6), 664(6 to 10), 665(9 to 4), 666(2 to 8), 673(5 to 12), 682(7 to 12), 683(10 to 9), 687(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(666: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(663: 1), (664: 3), (665: 3), (666: 2), (673: 2), (682: 2), (683: 1), (687: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 663: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),

Bundle 682: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 666: (to: 12, time: 0.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 687: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 687: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 673: (to: 4, time: 20.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6:
