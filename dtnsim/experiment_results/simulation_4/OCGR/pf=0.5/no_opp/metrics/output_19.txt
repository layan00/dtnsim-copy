The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
674(1 to 6), 675(6 to 10), 676(9 to 4), 677(2 to 8), 683(5 to 12), 690(7 to 12), 691(10 to 9), 692(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(674: 1), (675: 3), (676: 3), (677: 2), (683: 3), (690: 3), (691: 1), (692: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
