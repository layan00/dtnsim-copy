The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
564(1 to 6), 565(6 to 10), 566(9 to 4), 571(2 to 8), 578(5 to 12), 584(7 to 12), 585(10 to 9), 591(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(564: 80.000000), (565: 160.000000), (566: 40.000000), (571: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(564: 4), (565: 5), (566: 5), (571: 2), (578: 2), (584: 3), (585: 1), (591: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
