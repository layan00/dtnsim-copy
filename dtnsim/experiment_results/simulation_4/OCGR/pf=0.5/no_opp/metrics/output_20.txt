The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
109(1 to 6), 110(6 to 10), 111(9 to 4), 116(2 to 8), 122(5 to 12), 130(7 to 12), 131(10 to 9), 136(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(109: 80.000000), (111: 40.000000), (131: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(109: 4), (110: 3), (111: 5), (116: 6), (122: 5), (130: 2), (131: 4), (136: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
