The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
524(1 to 6), 525(6 to 10), 526(9 to 4), 529(2 to 8), 536(5 to 12), 545(7 to 12), 546(10 to 9), 549(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(545: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(524: 2), (525: 4), (526: 5), (529: 2), (536: 2), (545: 3), (546: 1), (549: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
