The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
702(1 to 6), 703(6 to 10), 704(9 to 4), 707(2 to 8), 714(5 to 12), 720(7 to 12), 721(10 to 9), 728(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(702: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(702: 5), (703: 4), (704: 5), (707: 6), (714: 2), (720: 3), (721: 1), (728: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
