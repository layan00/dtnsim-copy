The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
242(1 to 6), 243(6 to 10), 244(9 to 4), 246(2 to 8), 255(5 to 12), 260(7 to 12), 261(10 to 9), 265(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(242: 3), (243: 4), (244: 4), (246: 3), (255: 3), (260: 3), (261: 3), (265: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
