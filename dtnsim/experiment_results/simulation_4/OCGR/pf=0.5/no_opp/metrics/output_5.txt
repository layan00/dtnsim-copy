The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
101(1 to 6), 102(6 to 10), 103(9 to 4), 105(2 to 8), 109(5 to 12), 116(7 to 12), 117(10 to 9), 119(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(101: 1), (102: 3), (103: 4), (105: 3), (109: 2), (116: 2), (117: 1), (119: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 101: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
