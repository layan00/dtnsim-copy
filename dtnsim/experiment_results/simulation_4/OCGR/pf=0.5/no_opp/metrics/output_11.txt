The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
253(1 to 6), 254(6 to 10), 255(9 to 4), 258(2 to 8), 260(5 to 12), 262(7 to 12), 263(10 to 9), 264(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 1), (254: 4), (255: 4), (258: 2), (260: 2), (262: 3), (263: 2), (264: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
