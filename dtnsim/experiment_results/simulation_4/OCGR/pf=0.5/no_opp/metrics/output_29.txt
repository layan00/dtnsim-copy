The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
690(1 to 6), 691(6 to 10), 692(9 to 4), 694(2 to 8), 703(5 to 12), 709(7 to 12), 710(10 to 9), 712(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(694: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(690: 3), (691: 3), (692: 3), (694: 2), (703: 2), (709: 2), (710: 2), (712: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 690: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 692: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
