The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
99(1 to 6), 100(6 to 10), 101(9 to 4), 103(2 to 8), 111(5 to 12), 117(7 to 12), 118(10 to 9), 121(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(99: 5), (100: 3), (101: 3), (103: 4), (111: 2), (117: 2), (118: 2), (121: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
