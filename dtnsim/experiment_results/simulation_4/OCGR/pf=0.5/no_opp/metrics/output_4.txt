The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
693(1 to 6), 694(6 to 10), 695(9 to 4), 697(2 to 8), 706(5 to 12), 712(7 to 12), 713(10 to 9), 715(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(693: 80.000000), (697: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(693: 4), (694: 3), (695: 3), (697: 2), (706: 2), (712: 4), (713: 1), (715: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
