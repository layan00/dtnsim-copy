The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
378(1 to 6), 379(6 to 10), 380(9 to 4), 381(2 to 8), 387(5 to 12), 395(7 to 12), 396(10 to 9), 398(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(381: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(378: 1), (379: 4), (380: 3), (381: 2), (387: 3), (395: 2), (396: 1), (398: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
