The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
417(1 to 6), 418(6 to 10), 419(9 to 4), 421(2 to 8), 426(5 to 12), 432(7 to 12), 433(10 to 9), 436(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(421: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(417: 1), (418: 4), (419: 4), (421: 2), (426: 4), (432: 2), (433: 1), (436: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
