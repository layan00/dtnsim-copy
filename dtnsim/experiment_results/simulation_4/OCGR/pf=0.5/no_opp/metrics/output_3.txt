The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
550(1 to 6), 551(6 to 10), 552(9 to 4), 554(2 to 8), 558(5 to 12), 564(7 to 12), 565(10 to 9), 567(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(550: 2), (551: 4), (552: 3), (554: 2), (558: 3), (564: 3), (565: 1), (567: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
