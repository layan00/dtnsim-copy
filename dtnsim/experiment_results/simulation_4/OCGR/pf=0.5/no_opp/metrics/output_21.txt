The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
270(1 to 6), 271(6 to 10), 272(9 to 4), 273(2 to 8), 279(5 to 12), 285(7 to 12), 286(10 to 9), 288(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(286: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(270: 1), (271: 3), (272: 4), (273: 3), (279: 5), (285: 3), (286: 4), (288: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
