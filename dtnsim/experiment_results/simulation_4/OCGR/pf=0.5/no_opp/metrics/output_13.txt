The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
538(1 to 6), 539(6 to 10), 540(9 to 4), 543(2 to 8), 549(5 to 12), 555(7 to 12), 556(10 to 9), 557(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(539: 160.000000), (540: 140.000000), (549: 95.000000), (555: 80.000000), (556: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(538: 3), (539: 6), (540: 7), (543: 3), (549: 4), (555: 4), (556: 5), (557: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
