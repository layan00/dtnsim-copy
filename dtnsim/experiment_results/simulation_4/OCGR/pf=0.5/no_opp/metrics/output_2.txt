The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
414(1 to 6), 415(6 to 10), 416(9 to 4), 418(2 to 8), 421(5 to 12), 424(7 to 12), 425(10 to 9), 428(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(414: 1), (415: 6), (416: 6), (418: 2), (421: 2), (424: 3), (425: 2), (428: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
