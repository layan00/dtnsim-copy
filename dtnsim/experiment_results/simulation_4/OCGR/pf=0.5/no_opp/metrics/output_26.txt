The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(1 to 6), 246(6 to 10), 247(9 to 4), 250(2 to 8), 258(5 to 12), 266(7 to 12), 267(10 to 9), 269(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 140.000000), (250: 0.000000), (266: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 1), (246: 3), (247: 6), (250: 2), (258: 2), (266: 3), (267: 2), (269: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
