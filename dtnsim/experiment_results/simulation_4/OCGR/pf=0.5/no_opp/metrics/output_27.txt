The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
392(1 to 6), 393(6 to 10), 394(9 to 4), 395(2 to 8), 402(5 to 12), 406(7 to 12), 407(10 to 9), 408(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(392: 1), (393: 5), (394: 4), (395: 2), (402: 2), (406: 2), (407: 2), (408: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
