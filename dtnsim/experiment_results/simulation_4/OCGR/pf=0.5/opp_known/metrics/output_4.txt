The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1571(1 to 6), 1572(6 to 10), 1573(9 to 4), 1578(2 to 8), 1586(5 to 12), 1604(7 to 12), 1605(10 to 9), 1608(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1573: 80.000000), (1578: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1571: 3), (1572: 3), (1573: 5), (1578: 2), (1586: 2), (1604: 4), (1605: 1), (1608: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
