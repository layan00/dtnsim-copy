The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1569(1 to 6), 1570(6 to 10), 1571(9 to 4), 1576(2 to 8), 1582(5 to 12), 1601(7 to 12), 1602(10 to 9), 1611(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1569: 40.000000), (1571: 120.000000), (1601: 0.000000), (1611: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1569: 3), (1570: 3), (1571: 6), (1576: 2), (1582: 3), (1601: 6), (1602: 1), (1611: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
