The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1241(1 to 6), 1242(6 to 10), 1243(9 to 4), 1248(2 to 8), 1250(5 to 12), 1269(7 to 12), 1270(10 to 9), 1279(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1243: 40.000000), (1269: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1241: 3), (1242: 3), (1243: 8), (1248: 2), (1250: 2), (1269: 8), (1270: 2), (1279: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
