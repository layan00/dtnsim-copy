The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
235(1 to 6), 236(6 to 10), 237(9 to 4), 243(2 to 8), 246(5 to 12), 265(7 to 12), 266(10 to 9), 275(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 160.000000), (237: 140.000000), (243: 25.000000), (275: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(235: 5), (236: 10), (237: 9), (243: 3), (246: 3), (265: 6), (266: 4), (275: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 48 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
