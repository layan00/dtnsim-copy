The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
564(1 to 6), 565(6 to 10), 566(9 to 4), 572(2 to 8), 578(5 to 12), 594(7 to 12), 595(10 to 9), 598(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(564: 160.000000), (566: 0.000000), (572: 0.000000), (595: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(564: 5), (565: 3), (566: 3), (572: 2), (578: 3), (594: 4), (595: 6), (598: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
