The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
889(1 to 6), 890(6 to 10), 891(9 to 4), 896(2 to 8), 902(5 to 12), 922(7 to 12), 923(10 to 9), 930(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(891: 80.000000), (896: 0.000000), (922: 0.000000), (930: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(889: 3), (890: 3), (891: 5), (896: 2), (902: 3), (922: 6), (923: 1), (930: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
