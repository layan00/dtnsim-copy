The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
900(1 to 6), 901(6 to 10), 902(9 to 4), 907(2 to 8), 914(5 to 12), 930(7 to 12), 931(10 to 9), 937(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(900: 40.000000), (902: 80.000000), (930: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(900: 3), (901: 3), (902: 5), (907: 2), (914: 2), (930: 7), (931: 2), (937: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
