The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
922(1 to 6), 923(6 to 10), 924(9 to 4), 930(2 to 8), 933(5 to 12), 948(7 to 12), 949(10 to 9), 954(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(924: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(922: 3), (923: 8), (924: 5), (930: 2), (933: 2), (948: 4), (949: 2), (954: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
