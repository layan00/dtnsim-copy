The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1237(1 to 6), 1238(6 to 10), 1239(9 to 4), 1245(2 to 8), 1250(5 to 12), 1270(7 to 12), 1271(10 to 9), 1275(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1237: 80.000000), (1239: 0.000000), (1245: 25.000000), (1270: 80.000000), (1275: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1237: 4), (1238: 3), (1239: 3), (1245: 3), (1250: 2), (1270: 7), (1271: 1), (1275: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
