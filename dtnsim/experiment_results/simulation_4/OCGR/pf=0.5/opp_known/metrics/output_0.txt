The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(1 to 6), 247(6 to 10), 248(9 to 4), 259(2 to 8), 267(5 to 12), 285(7 to 12), 286(10 to 9), 295(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 40.000000), (247: 0.000000), (248: 80.000000), (259: 0.000000), (285: 0.000000), (295: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 3), (247: 8), (248: 5), (259: 2), (267: 5), (285: 6), (286: 1), (295: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
