The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
578(1 to 6), 579(6 to 10), 580(9 to 4), 588(2 to 8), 590(5 to 12), 604(7 to 12), 605(10 to 9), 608(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(578: 160.000000), (580: 0.000000), (604: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(578: 5), (579: 8), (580: 3), (588: 2), (590: 2), (604: 7), (605: 2), (608: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
