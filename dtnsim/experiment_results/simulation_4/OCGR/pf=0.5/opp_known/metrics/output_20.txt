The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
241(1 to 6), 242(6 to 10), 243(9 to 4), 251(2 to 8), 256(5 to 12), 276(7 to 12), 277(10 to 9), 294(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 80.000000), (242: 40.000000), (243: 40.000000), (251: 25.000000), (276: 0.000000), (277: 40.000000), (294: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(241: 4), (242: 8), (243: 8), (251: 6), (256: 5), (276: 6), (277: 4), (294: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
