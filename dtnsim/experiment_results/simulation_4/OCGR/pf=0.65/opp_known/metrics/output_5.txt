The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(1 to 6), 223(6 to 10), 224(9 to 4), 229(2 to 8), 234(5 to 12), 250(7 to 12), 251(10 to 9), 259(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(222: 40.000000), (224: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 3), (223: 3), (224: 9), (229: 3), (234: 2), (250: 6), (251: 1), (259: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
