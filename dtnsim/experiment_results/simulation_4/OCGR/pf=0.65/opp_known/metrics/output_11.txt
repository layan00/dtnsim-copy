The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
548(1 to 6), 549(6 to 10), 550(9 to 4), 558(2 to 8), 560(5 to 12), 574(7 to 12), 575(10 to 9), 578(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(548: 160.000000), (550: 0.000000), (574: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(548: 5), (549: 8), (550: 3), (558: 2), (560: 2), (574: 7), (575: 2), (578: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
