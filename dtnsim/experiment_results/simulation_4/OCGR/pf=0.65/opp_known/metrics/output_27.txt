The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
838(1 to 6), 839(6 to 10), 840(9 to 4), 845(2 to 8), 850(5 to 12), 866(7 to 12), 867(10 to 9), 871(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(840: 80.000000), (866: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(838: 3), (839: 3), (840: 5), (845: 2), (850: 2), (866: 8), (867: 2), (871: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
