The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
846(1 to 6), 847(6 to 10), 848(9 to 4), 853(2 to 8), 860(5 to 12), 876(7 to 12), 877(10 to 9), 882(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(846: 40.000000), (848: 120.000000), (853: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(846: 3), (847: 3), (848: 6), (853: 2), (860: 2), (876: 6), (877: 1), (882: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
