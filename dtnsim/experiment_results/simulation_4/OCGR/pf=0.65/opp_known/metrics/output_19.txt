The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1478(1 to 6), 1479(6 to 10), 1480(9 to 4), 1485(2 to 8), 1490(5 to 12), 1507(7 to 12), 1508(10 to 9), 1513(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1478: 40.000000), (1480: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1478: 3), (1479: 3), (1480: 6), (1485: 2), (1490: 3), (1507: 4), (1508: 1), (1513: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
