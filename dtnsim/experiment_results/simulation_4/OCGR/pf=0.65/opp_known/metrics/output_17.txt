The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
855(1 to 6), 856(6 to 10), 857(9 to 4), 862(2 to 8), 866(5 to 12), 881(7 to 12), 882(10 to 9), 885(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(857: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(855: 3), (856: 3), (857: 5), (862: 3), (866: 3), (881: 4), (882: 1), (885: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
