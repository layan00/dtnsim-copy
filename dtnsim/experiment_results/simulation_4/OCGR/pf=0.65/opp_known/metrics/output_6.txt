The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
536(1 to 6), 537(6 to 10), 538(9 to 4), 543(2 to 8), 547(5 to 12), 563(7 to 12), 564(10 to 9), 567(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(536: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(536: 4), (537: 3), (538: 6), (543: 3), (547: 3), (563: 6), (564: 1), (567: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
