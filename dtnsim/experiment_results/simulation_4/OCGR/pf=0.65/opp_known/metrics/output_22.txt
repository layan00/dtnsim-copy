The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
899(1 to 6), 900(6 to 10), 901(9 to 4), 907(2 to 8), 911(5 to 12), 929(7 to 12), 930(10 to 9), 941(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(899: 160.000000), (900: 40.000000), (901: 80.000000), (907: 0.000000), (929: 0.000000), (941: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(899: 5), (900: 8), (901: 5), (907: 2), (911: 4), (929: 6), (930: 1), (941: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
