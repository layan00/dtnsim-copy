The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1154(1 to 6), 1155(6 to 10), 1156(9 to 4), 1161(2 to 8), 1162(5 to 12), 1179(7 to 12), 1180(10 to 9), 1184(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1156: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1154: 3), (1155: 3), (1156: 5), (1161: 2), (1162: 2), (1179: 6), (1180: 2), (1184: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
