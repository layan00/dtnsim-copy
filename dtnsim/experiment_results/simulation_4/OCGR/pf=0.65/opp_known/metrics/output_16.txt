The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
547(1 to 6), 548(6 to 10), 549(9 to 4), 554(2 to 8), 558(5 to 12), 573(7 to 12), 574(10 to 9), 577(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(547: 160.000000), (549: 120.000000), (554: 0.000000), (574: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(547: 5), (548: 3), (549: 6), (554: 2), (558: 3), (573: 4), (574: 6), (577: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
