The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1554(1 to 6), 1555(6 to 10), 1556(9 to 4), 1562(2 to 8), 1565(5 to 12), 1583(7 to 12), 1584(10 to 9), 1589(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1554: 80.000000), (1556: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1554: 4), (1555: 8), (1556: 5), (1562: 2), (1565: 2), (1583: 4), (1584: 1), (1589: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
