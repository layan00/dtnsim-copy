The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1458(1 to 6), 1459(6 to 10), 1460(9 to 4), 1466(2 to 8), 1471(5 to 12), 1489(7 to 12), 1490(10 to 9), 1496(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1458: 40.000000), (1460: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1458: 3), (1459: 3), (1460: 3), (1466: 2), (1471: 2), (1489: 6), (1490: 1), (1496: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
