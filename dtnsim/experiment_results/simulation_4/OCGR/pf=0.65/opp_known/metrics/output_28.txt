The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1152(1 to 6), 1153(6 to 10), 1154(9 to 4), 1160(2 to 8), 1165(5 to 12), 1183(7 to 12), 1184(10 to 9), 1188(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1152: 80.000000), (1154: 0.000000), (1160: 25.000000), (1188: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1152: 4), (1153: 3), (1154: 3), (1160: 3), (1165: 2), (1183: 4), (1184: 1), (1188: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
