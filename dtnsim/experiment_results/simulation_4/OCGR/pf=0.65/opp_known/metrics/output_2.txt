The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
858(1 to 6), 859(6 to 10), 860(9 to 4), 865(2 to 8), 866(5 to 12), 880(7 to 12), 881(10 to 9), 884(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(858: 3), (859: 3), (860: 6), (865: 2), (866: 2), (880: 4), (881: 2), (884: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
