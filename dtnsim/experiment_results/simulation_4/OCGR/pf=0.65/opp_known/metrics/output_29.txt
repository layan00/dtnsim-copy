The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1475(1 to 6), 1476(6 to 10), 1477(9 to 4), 1482(2 to 8), 1489(5 to 12), 1506(7 to 12), 1507(10 to 9), 1514(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1475: 160.000000), (1482: 0.000000), (1506: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1475: 5), (1476: 3), (1477: 6), (1482: 2), (1489: 2), (1506: 6), (1507: 2), (1514: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
