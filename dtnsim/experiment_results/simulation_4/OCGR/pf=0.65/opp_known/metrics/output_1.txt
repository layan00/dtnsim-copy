The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
554(1 to 6), 555(6 to 10), 556(9 to 4), 563(2 to 8), 567(5 to 12), 584(7 to 12), 585(10 to 9), 588(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(554: 80.000000), (556: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(554: 4), (555: 11), (556: 5), (563: 3), (567: 2), (584: 4), (585: 1), (588: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
