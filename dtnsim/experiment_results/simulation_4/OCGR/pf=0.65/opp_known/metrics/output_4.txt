The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1461(1 to 6), 1462(6 to 10), 1463(9 to 4), 1468(2 to 8), 1476(5 to 12), 1492(7 to 12), 1493(10 to 9), 1496(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1463: 80.000000), (1468: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1461: 3), (1462: 3), (1463: 5), (1468: 2), (1476: 2), (1492: 4), (1493: 1), (1496: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
