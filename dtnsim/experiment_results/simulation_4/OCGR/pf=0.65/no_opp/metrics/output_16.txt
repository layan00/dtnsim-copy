The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
219(1 to 6), 220(6 to 10), 221(9 to 4), 222(2 to 8), 226(5 to 12), 229(7 to 12), 230(10 to 9), 232(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(222: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(219: 1), (220: 3), (221: 3), (222: 2), (226: 3), (229: 2), (230: 3), (232: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 219: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
