The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
456(1 to 6), 457(6 to 10), 458(9 to 4), 460(2 to 8), 466(5 to 12), 472(7 to 12), 473(10 to 9), 476(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(460: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(456: 2), (457: 3), (458: 3), (460: 3), (466: 2), (472: 2), (473: 1), (476: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 456: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 458: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
