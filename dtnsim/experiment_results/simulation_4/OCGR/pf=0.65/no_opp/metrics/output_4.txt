The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
578(1 to 6), 579(6 to 10), 580(9 to 4), 582(2 to 8), 591(5 to 12), 595(7 to 12), 596(10 to 9), 597(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(582: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(578: 3), (579: 3), (580: 3), (582: 2), (591: 2), (595: 2), (596: 1), (597: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 578: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
