The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 6), 215(6 to 10), 216(9 to 4), 218(2 to 8), 223(5 to 12), 227(7 to 12), 228(10 to 9), 230(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 3), (215: 4), (216: 3), (218: 3), (223: 3), (227: 3), (228: 1), (230: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
