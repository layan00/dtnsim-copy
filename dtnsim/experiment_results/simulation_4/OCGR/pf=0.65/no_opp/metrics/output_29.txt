The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
588(1 to 6), 589(6 to 10), 590(9 to 4), 592(2 to 8), 601(5 to 12), 606(7 to 12), 607(10 to 9), 608(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(592: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(588: 3), (589: 3), (590: 3), (592: 2), (601: 2), (606: 2), (607: 2), (608: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 588: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 590: (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
