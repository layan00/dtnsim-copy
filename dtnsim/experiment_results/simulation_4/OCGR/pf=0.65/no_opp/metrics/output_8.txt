The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
458(1 to 6), 459(6 to 10), 460(9 to 4), 462(2 to 8), 463(5 to 12), 468(7 to 12), 469(10 to 9), 470(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(458: 2), (459: 3), (460: 3), (462: 2), (463: 2), (468: 2), (469: 2), (470: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
