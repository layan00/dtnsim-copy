The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
339(1 to 6), 340(6 to 10), 341(9 to 4), 342(2 to 8), 348(5 to 12), 352(7 to 12), 353(10 to 9), 354(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(342: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(339: 1), (340: 4), (341: 3), (342: 2), (348: 2), (352: 2), (353: 1), (354: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
