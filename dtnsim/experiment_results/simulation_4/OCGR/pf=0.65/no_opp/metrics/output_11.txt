The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(1 to 6), 222(6 to 10), 223(9 to 4), 226(2 to 8), 228(5 to 12), 230(7 to 12), 231(10 to 9), 232(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 1), (222: 4), (223: 4), (226: 2), (228: 2), (230: 3), (231: 2), (232: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
