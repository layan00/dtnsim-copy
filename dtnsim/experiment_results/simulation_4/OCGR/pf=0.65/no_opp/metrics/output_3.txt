The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
454(1 to 6), 455(6 to 10), 456(9 to 4), 457(2 to 8), 461(5 to 12), 465(7 to 12), 466(10 to 9), 468(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(454: 1), (455: 4), (456: 3), (457: 2), (461: 3), (465: 3), (466: 1), (468: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
