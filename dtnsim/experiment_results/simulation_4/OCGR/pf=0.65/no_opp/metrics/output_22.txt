The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
380(1 to 6), 381(6 to 10), 382(9 to 4), 384(2 to 8), 388(5 to 12), 394(7 to 12), 395(10 to 9), 398(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(384: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(380: 1), (381: 4), (382: 4), (384: 2), (388: 4), (394: 2), (395: 1), (398: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
