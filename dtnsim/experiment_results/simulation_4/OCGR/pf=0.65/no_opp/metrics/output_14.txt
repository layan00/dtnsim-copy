The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
614(1 to 6), 615(6 to 10), 616(9 to 4), 618(2 to 8), 623(5 to 12), 628(7 to 12), 629(10 to 9), 635(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(614: 1), (615: 4), (616: 5), (618: 6), (623: 2), (628: 3), (629: 1), (635: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
