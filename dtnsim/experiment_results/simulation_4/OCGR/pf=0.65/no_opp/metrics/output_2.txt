The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
346(1 to 6), 347(6 to 10), 348(9 to 4), 349(2 to 8), 350(5 to 12), 352(7 to 12), 353(10 to 9), 355(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(346: 1), (347: 4), (348: 3), (349: 2), (350: 2), (352: 2), (353: 2), (355: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
