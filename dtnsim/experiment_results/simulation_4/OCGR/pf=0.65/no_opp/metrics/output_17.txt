The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
335(1 to 6), 336(6 to 10), 337(9 to 4), 338(2 to 8), 342(5 to 12), 345(7 to 12), 346(10 to 9), 347(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(335: 1), (336: 4), (337: 3), (338: 3), (342: 3), (345: 2), (346: 1), (347: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
