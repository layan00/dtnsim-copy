The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(1 to 6), 482(6 to 10), 483(9 to 4), 486(2 to 8), 488(5 to 12), 493(7 to 12), 494(10 to 9), 495(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(488: 95.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 2), (482: 6), (483: 4), (486: 2), (488: 4), (493: 2), (494: 1), (495: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
