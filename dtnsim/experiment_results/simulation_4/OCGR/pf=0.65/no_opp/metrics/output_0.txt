The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
94(1 to 6), 95(6 to 10), 96(9 to 4), 98(2 to 8), 101(5 to 12), 107(7 to 12), 108(10 to 9), 109(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(109: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(94: 1), (95: 4), (96: 4), (98: 2), (101: 2), (107: 2), (108: 1), (109: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 94: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
