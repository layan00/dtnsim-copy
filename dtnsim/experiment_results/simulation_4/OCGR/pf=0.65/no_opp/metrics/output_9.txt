The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
577(1 to 6), 578(6 to 10), 579(9 to 4), 580(2 to 8), 585(5 to 12), 591(7 to 12), 592(10 to 9), 596(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(577: 1), (578: 3), (579: 3), (580: 2), (585: 2), (591: 2), (592: 1), (596: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
