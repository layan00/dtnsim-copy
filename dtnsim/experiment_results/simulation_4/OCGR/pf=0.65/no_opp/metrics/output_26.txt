The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 6), 199(6 to 10), 200(9 to 4), 203(2 to 8), 209(5 to 12), 214(7 to 12), 215(10 to 9), 217(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 1), (199: 3), (200: 5), (203: 3), (209: 2), (214: 3), (215: 2), (217: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
