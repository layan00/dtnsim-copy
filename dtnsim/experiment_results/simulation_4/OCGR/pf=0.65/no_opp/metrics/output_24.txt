The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
646(1 to 6), 647(6 to 10), 648(9 to 4), 651(2 to 8), 654(5 to 12), 660(7 to 12), 661(10 to 9), 664(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(646: 2), (647: 3), (648: 5), (651: 2), (654: 2), (660: 3), (661: 1), (664: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
