The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
457(1 to 6), 458(6 to 10), 459(9 to 4), 462(2 to 8), 468(5 to 12), 475(7 to 12), 476(10 to 9), 479(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(475: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(457: 2), (458: 3), (459: 5), (462: 2), (468: 2), (475: 3), (476: 1), (479: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
