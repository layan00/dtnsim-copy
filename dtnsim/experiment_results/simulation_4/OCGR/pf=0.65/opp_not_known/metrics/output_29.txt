The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1952(1 to 6), 1953(6 to 10), 1954(9 to 4), 1960(2 to 8), 1981(5 to 12), 2010(7 to 12), 2011(10 to 9), 2018(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1960: 0.000000), (2010: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1952: 3), (1953: 5), (1954: 6), (1960: 2), (1981: 2), (2010: 6), (2011: 2), (2018: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
