The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(1 to 6), 246(6 to 10), 247(9 to 4), 250(2 to 8), 265(5 to 12), 296(7 to 12), 297(10 to 9), 307(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 160.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(245: 1), (246: 7), (247: 5), (250: 6), (265: 2), (296: 4), (297: 2), (307: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
