The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1939(1 to 6), 1940(6 to 10), 1941(9 to 4), 1946(2 to 8), 1962(5 to 12), 1991(7 to 12), 1992(10 to 9), 1993(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1941: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1939: 1), (1940: 6), (1941: 6), (1946: 2), (1962: 3), (1991: 3), (1992: 1), (1993: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
