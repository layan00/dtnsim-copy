The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1512(1 to 6), 1513(6 to 10), 1514(9 to 4), 1518(2 to 8), 1536(5 to 12), 1567(7 to 12), 1568(10 to 9), 1575(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1567: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1512: 2), (1513: 3), (1514: 6), (1518: 2), (1536: 2), (1567: 6), (1568: 1), (1575: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
