The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2023(1 to 6), 2024(6 to 10), 2025(9 to 4), 2029(2 to 8), 2044(5 to 12), 2074(7 to 12), 2075(10 to 9), 2079(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2023: 2), (2024: 3), (2025: 5), (2029: 2), (2044: 2), (2074: 3), (2075: 1), (2079: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
