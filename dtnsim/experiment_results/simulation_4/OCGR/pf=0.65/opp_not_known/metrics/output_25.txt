The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(1 to 6), 228(6 to 10), 229(9 to 4), 235(2 to 8), 252(5 to 12), 281(7 to 12), 282(10 to 9), 286(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 3), (228: 5), (229: 6), (235: 3), (252: 2), (281: 4), (282: 1), (286: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
