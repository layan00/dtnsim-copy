The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1508(1 to 6), 1509(6 to 10), 1510(9 to 4), 1515(2 to 8), 1531(5 to 12), 1559(7 to 12), 1560(10 to 9), 1561(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1508: 1), (1509: 5), (1510: 6), (1515: 2), (1531: 3), (1559: 3), (1560: 1), (1561: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
