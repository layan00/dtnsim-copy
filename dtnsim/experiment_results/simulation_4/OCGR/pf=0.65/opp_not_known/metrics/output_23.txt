The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1588(1 to 6), 1589(6 to 10), 1590(9 to 4), 1593(2 to 8), 1610(5 to 12), 1639(7 to 12), 1640(10 to 9), 1645(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1588: 40.000000), (1590: 120.000000), (1593: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1588: 3), (1589: 6), (1590: 6), (1593: 3), (1610: 2), (1639: 3), (1640: 1), (1645: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
