The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1512(1 to 6), 1513(6 to 10), 1514(9 to 4), 1521(2 to 8), 1539(5 to 12), 1569(7 to 12), 1570(10 to 9), 1572(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1514: 0.000000), (1521: 25.000000), (1572: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1512: 2), (1513: 5), (1514: 3), (1521: 3), (1539: 2), (1569: 2), (1570: 1), (1572: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
