The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1080(1 to 6), 1081(6 to 10), 1082(9 to 4), 1087(2 to 8), 1105(5 to 12), 1133(7 to 12), 1134(10 to 9), 1136(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1080: 1), (1081: 6), (1082: 5), (1087: 2), (1105: 2), (1133: 2), (1134: 2), (1136: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
