The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1972(1 to 6), 1973(6 to 10), 1974(9 to 4), 1981(2 to 8), 1998(5 to 12), 2027(7 to 12), 2028(10 to 9), 2032(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1974: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1972: 1), (1973: 6), (1974: 3), (1981: 6), (1998: 2), (2027: 3), (2028: 1), (2032: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
