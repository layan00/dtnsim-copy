The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1934(1 to 6), 1935(6 to 10), 1936(9 to 4), 1942(2 to 8), 1963(5 to 12), 1991(7 to 12), 1992(10 to 9), 1993(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1936: 80.000000), (1942: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1934: 3), (1935: 5), (1936: 5), (1942: 2), (1963: 2), (1991: 2), (1992: 1), (1993: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
