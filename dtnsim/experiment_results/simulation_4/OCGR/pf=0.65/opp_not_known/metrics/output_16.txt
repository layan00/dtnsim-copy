The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
666(1 to 6), 667(6 to 10), 668(9 to 4), 673(2 to 8), 689(5 to 12), 716(7 to 12), 717(10 to 9), 719(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(668: 120.000000), (673: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(666: 1), (667: 5), (668: 6), (673: 2), (689: 3), (716: 2), (717: 3), (719: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
