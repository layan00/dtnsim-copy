The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
662(1 to 6), 663(6 to 10), 664(9 to 4), 670(2 to 8), 687(5 to 12), 715(7 to 12), 716(10 to 9), 719(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(662: 3), (663: 5), (664: 6), (670: 3), (687: 3), (715: 3), (716: 1), (719: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
