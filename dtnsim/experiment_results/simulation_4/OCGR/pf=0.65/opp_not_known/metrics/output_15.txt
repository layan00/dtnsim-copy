The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
235(1 to 6), 236(6 to 10), 237(9 to 4), 240(2 to 8), 260(5 to 12), 286(7 to 12), 287(10 to 9), 293(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 40.000000), (236: 100.000000), (237: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(235: 3), (236: 6), (237: 5), (240: 3), (260: 3), (286: 3), (287: 3), (293: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
