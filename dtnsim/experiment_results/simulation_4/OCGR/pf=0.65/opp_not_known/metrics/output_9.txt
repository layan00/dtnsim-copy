The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1938(1 to 6), 1939(6 to 10), 1940(9 to 4), 1946(2 to 8), 1963(5 to 12), 1993(7 to 12), 1994(10 to 9), 1996(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1940: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1938: 1), (1939: 5), (1940: 3), (1946: 2), (1963: 2), (1993: 2), (1994: 1), (1996: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
