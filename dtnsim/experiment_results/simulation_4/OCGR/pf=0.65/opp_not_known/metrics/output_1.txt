The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
679(1 to 6), 680(6 to 10), 681(9 to 4), 684(2 to 8), 700(5 to 12), 729(7 to 12), 730(10 to 9), 734(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(681: 80.000000), (684: 125.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(679: 1), (680: 3), (681: 5), (684: 6), (700: 2), (729: 3), (730: 1), (734: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
