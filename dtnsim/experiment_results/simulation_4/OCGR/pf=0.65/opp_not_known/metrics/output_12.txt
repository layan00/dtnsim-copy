The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1102(1 to 6), 1103(6 to 10), 1104(9 to 4), 1110(2 to 8), 1125(5 to 12), 1154(7 to 12), 1155(10 to 9), 1158(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1104: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1102: 1), (1103: 7), (1104: 5), (1110: 2), (1125: 2), (1154: 5), (1155: 1), (1158: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
