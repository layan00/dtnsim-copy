The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
236(1 to 6), 237(6 to 10), 238(9 to 4), 244(2 to 8), 259(5 to 12), 289(7 to 12), 290(10 to 9), 293(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 120.000000), (244: 25.000000), (293: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 3), (237: 5), (238: 6), (244: 3), (259: 2), (289: 2), (290: 2), (293: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
