The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
688(1 to 6), 689(6 to 10), 690(9 to 4), 696(2 to 8), 714(5 to 12), 744(7 to 12), 745(10 to 9), 752(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(690: 0.000000), (744: 0.000000), (745: 40.000000), (752: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(688: 1), (689: 6), (690: 3), (696: 3), (714: 5), (744: 6), (745: 4), (752: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
