The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1097(1 to 6), 1098(6 to 10), 1099(9 to 4), 1104(2 to 8), 1117(5 to 12), 1143(7 to 12), 1144(10 to 9), 1146(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1097: 1), (1098: 5), (1099: 6), (1104: 2), (1117: 2), (1143: 2), (1144: 2), (1146: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
