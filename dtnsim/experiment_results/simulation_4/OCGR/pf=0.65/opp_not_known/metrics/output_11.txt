The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
672(1 to 6), 673(6 to 10), 674(9 to 4), 678(2 to 8), 692(5 to 12), 718(7 to 12), 719(10 to 9), 722(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(672: 1), (673: 5), (674: 3), (678: 2), (692: 2), (718: 3), (719: 2), (722: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 672: (to: 9, time: 20.000000),
