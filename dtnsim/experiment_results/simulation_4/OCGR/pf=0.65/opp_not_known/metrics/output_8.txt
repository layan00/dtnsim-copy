The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1513(1 to 6), 1514(6 to 10), 1515(9 to 4), 1521(2 to 8), 1534(5 to 12), 1563(7 to 12), 1564(10 to 9), 1568(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1515: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1513: 2), (1514: 5), (1515: 5), (1521: 2), (1534: 2), (1563: 4), (1564: 2), (1568: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
