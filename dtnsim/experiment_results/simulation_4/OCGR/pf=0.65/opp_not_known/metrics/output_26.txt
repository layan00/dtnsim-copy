The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
649(1 to 6), 650(6 to 10), 651(9 to 4), 654(2 to 8), 673(5 to 12), 702(7 to 12), 703(10 to 9), 709(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(649: 40.000000), (651: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(649: 3), (650: 3), (651: 5), (654: 3), (673: 2), (702: 4), (703: 2), (709: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
