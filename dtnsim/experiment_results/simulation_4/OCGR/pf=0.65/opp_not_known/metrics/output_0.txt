The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
238(1 to 6), 239(6 to 10), 240(9 to 4), 246(2 to 8), 261(5 to 12), 291(7 to 12), 292(10 to 9), 299(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(240: 80.000000), (291: 0.000000), (299: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(238: 1), (239: 6), (240: 5), (246: 3), (261: 2), (291: 6), (292: 1), (299: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
