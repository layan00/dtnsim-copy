The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
589(1 to 6), 590(6 to 10), 591(9 to 4), 601(2 to 8), 612(5 to 12), 622(7 to 12), 623(10 to 9), 631(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(589: 80.000000), (590: 160.000000), (591: 140.000000), (601: 125.000000), (612: 95.000000), (622: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(589: 8), (590: 10), (591: 6), (601: 8), (612: 10), (622: 6), (623: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
