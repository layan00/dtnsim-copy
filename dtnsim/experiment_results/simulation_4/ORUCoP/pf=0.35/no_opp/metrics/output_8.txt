The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
579(1 to 6), 580(6 to 10), 581(9 to 4), 587(2 to 8), 591(5 to 12), 600(7 to 12), 601(10 to 9), 607(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(580: 160.000000), (581: 140.000000), (600: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(579: 1), (580: 6), (581: 4), (591: 3), (600: 3), (601: 5), (607: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
