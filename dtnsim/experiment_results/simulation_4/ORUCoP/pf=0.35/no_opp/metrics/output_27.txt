The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
440(1 to 6), 441(6 to 10), 442(9 to 4), 447(2 to 8), 461(5 to 12), 469(7 to 12), 470(10 to 9), 479(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(440: 80.000000), (441: 160.000000), (442: 140.000000), (461: 95.000000), (469: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(440: 4), (441: 6), (442: 8), (447: 4), (461: 4), (469: 3), (470: 4), (479: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
