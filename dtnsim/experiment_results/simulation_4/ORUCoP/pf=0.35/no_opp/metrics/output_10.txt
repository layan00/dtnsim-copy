The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
88(1 to 6), 89(6 to 10), 90(9 to 4), 96(2 to 8), 104(5 to 12), 113(7 to 12), 114(10 to 9), 124(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(90: 140.000000), (96: 25.000000), (104: 95.000000), (113: 80.000000), (114: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(88: 1), (89: 8), (90: 9), (96: 2), (104: 6), (113: 9), (114: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
