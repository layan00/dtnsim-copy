The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
625(1 to 6), 626(6 to 10), 627(9 to 4), 633(2 to 8), 643(5 to 12), 652(7 to 12), 653(10 to 9), 660(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(633: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(625: 1), (626: 3), (627: 3), (633: 2), (643: 1), (652: 1), (653: 3), (660: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 625: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
