The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
417(1 to 6), 418(6 to 10), 419(9 to 4), 425(2 to 8), 432(5 to 12), 440(7 to 12), 441(10 to 9), 449(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(441: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(418: 4), (419: 4), (425: 5), (432: 4), (440: 2), (441: 4), (449: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
