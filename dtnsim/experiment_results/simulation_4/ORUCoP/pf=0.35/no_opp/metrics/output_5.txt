The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
85(1 to 6), 86(6 to 10), 87(9 to 4), 92(2 to 8), 98(5 to 12), 109(7 to 12), 110(10 to 9), 121(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(110: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(86: 3), (87: 3), (92: 1), (98: 2), (109: 2), (110: 5), (121: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 110: (to: 9, time: 140.000000), 
Bundle 121: (to: 9, time: 140.000000),
