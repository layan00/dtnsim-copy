The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
265(1 to 6), 266(6 to 10), 267(9 to 4), 274(2 to 8), 278(5 to 12), 284(7 to 12), 285(10 to 9), 288(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(278: 95.000000), (284: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(266: 6), (267: 3), (278: 4), (284: 3), (285: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 266: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), (to: 2, time: 100.000000),
