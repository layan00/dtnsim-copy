The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
770(1 to 6), 771(6 to 10), 772(9 to 4), 779(2 to 8), 788(5 to 12), 796(7 to 12), 797(10 to 9), 809(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(770: 120.000000), (771: 160.000000), (779: 125.000000), (797: 40.000000), (809: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(770: 4), (771: 7), (772: 7), (779: 6), (796: 4), (797: 4), (809: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
