The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
789(1 to 6), 790(6 to 10), 791(9 to 4), 801(2 to 8), 816(5 to 12), 824(7 to 12), 825(10 to 9), 834(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(789: 80.000000), (791: 40.000000), (801: 0.000000), (816: 95.000000), (824: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(789: 6), (790: 5), (791: 7), (801: 4), (816: 7), (824: 6), (825: 2), (834: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
