The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
103(1 to 6), 104(6 to 10), 105(9 to 4), 115(2 to 8), 128(5 to 12), 138(7 to 12), 139(10 to 9), 151(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(103: 80.000000), (104: 160.000000), (105: 40.000000), (115: 0.000000), (128: 95.000000), (139: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(103: 11), (104: 6), (105: 6), (115: 6), (128: 6), (139: 7), (151: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
