The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
742(1 to 6), 743(6 to 10), 744(9 to 4), 750(2 to 8), 761(5 to 12), 772(7 to 12), 773(10 to 9), 785(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(750: 0.000000), (773: 40.000000), (785: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(743: 5), (744: 5), (750: 6), (772: 6), (773: 4), (785: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
