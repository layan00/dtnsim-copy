The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
428(1 to 6), 429(6 to 10), 430(9 to 4), 437(2 to 8), 446(5 to 12), 452(7 to 12), 453(10 to 9), 456(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(430: 140.000000), (437: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(429: 2), (430: 7), (437: 2), (446: 1), (456: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 430: (to: 9, time: 20.000000), (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2:
