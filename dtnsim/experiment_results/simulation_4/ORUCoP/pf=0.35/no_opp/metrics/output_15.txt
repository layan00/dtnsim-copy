The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(1 to 6), 85(6 to 10), 86(9 to 4), 96(2 to 8), 109(5 to 12), 112(7 to 12), 113(10 to 9), 117(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(86: 140.000000), (113: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 4), (85: 4), (86: 7), (96: 2), (109: 6), (112: 2), (113: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
