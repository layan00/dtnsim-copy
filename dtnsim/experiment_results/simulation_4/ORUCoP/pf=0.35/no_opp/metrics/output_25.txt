The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
99(1 to 6), 100(6 to 10), 101(9 to 4), 111(2 to 8), 127(5 to 12), 136(7 to 12), 137(10 to 9), 145(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(99: 120.000000), (101: 40.000000), (111: 0.000000), (145: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(99: 8), (100: 4), (101: 7), (111: 6), (127: 2), (136: 1), (137: 2), (145: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
