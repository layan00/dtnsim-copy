The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
396(1 to 6), 397(6 to 10), 398(9 to 4), 402(2 to 8), 411(5 to 12), 421(7 to 12), 422(10 to 9), 428(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(402: 0.000000), (422: 40.000000), (428: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(397: 3), (398: 1), (402: 2), (411: 5), (421: 1), (422: 4), (428: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
