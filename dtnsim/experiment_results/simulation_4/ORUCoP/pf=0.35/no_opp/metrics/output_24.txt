The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
835(1 to 6), 836(6 to 10), 837(9 to 4), 844(2 to 8), 852(5 to 12), 863(7 to 12), 864(10 to 9), 874(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(844: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(835: 1), (836: 4), (837: 5), (844: 2), (852: 6), (863: 4), (864: 7), (874: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
