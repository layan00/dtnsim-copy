The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
632(1 to 6), 633(6 to 10), 634(9 to 4), 643(2 to 8), 653(5 to 12), 662(7 to 12), 663(10 to 9), 678(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(632: 80.000000), (633: 160.000000), (634: 40.000000), (643: 0.000000), (653: 95.000000), (662: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(632: 7), (633: 10), (634: 7), (643: 4), (653: 7), (662: 9), (663: 7), (678: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
