The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
309(1 to 6), 310(6 to 10), 311(9 to 4), 321(2 to 8), 332(5 to 12), 341(7 to 12), 342(10 to 9), 351(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(309: 80.000000), (311: 40.000000), (321: 125.000000), (342: 40.000000), (351: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(309: 6), (310: 4), (311: 6), (321: 6), (341: 2), (342: 5), (351: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
