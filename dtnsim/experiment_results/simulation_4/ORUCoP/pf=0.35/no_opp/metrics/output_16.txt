The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
239(1 to 6), 240(6 to 10), 241(9 to 4), 246(2 to 8), 255(5 to 12), 263(7 to 12), 264(10 to 9), 271(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 0.000000), (255: 95.000000), (263: 80.000000), (264: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(240: 4), (241: 2), (246: 2), (255: 7), (263: 6), (264: 8), (271: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
