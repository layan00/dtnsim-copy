The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
557(1 to 6), 558(6 to 10), 559(9 to 4), 566(2 to 8), 575(5 to 12), 586(7 to 12), 587(10 to 9), 595(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(575: 95.000000), (586: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(557: 1), (558: 4), (559: 5), (575: 4), (586: 3), (587: 4), (595: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
