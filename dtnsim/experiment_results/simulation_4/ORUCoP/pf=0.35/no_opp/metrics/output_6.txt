The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
251(1 to 6), 252(6 to 10), 253(9 to 4), 258(2 to 8), 272(5 to 12), 281(7 to 12), 282(10 to 9), 291(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(258: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(251: 2), (252: 6), (253: 4), (258: 3), (272: 6), (281: 7), (282: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
