The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
448(1 to 6), 449(6 to 10), 450(9 to 4), 455(2 to 8), 464(5 to 12), 473(7 to 12), 474(10 to 9), 483(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(450: 140.000000), (455: 0.000000), (464: 95.000000), (473: 80.000000), (474: 40.000000), (483: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(449: 7), (450: 9), (455: 6), (464: 5), (473: 3), (474: 4), (483: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
