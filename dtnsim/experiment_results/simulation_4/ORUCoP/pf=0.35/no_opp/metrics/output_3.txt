The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
627(1 to 6), 628(6 to 10), 629(9 to 4), 634(2 to 8), 644(5 to 12), 653(7 to 12), 654(10 to 9), 659(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(634: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(627: 1), (628: 4), (629: 3), (634: 2), (644: 6), (653: 2), (659: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
