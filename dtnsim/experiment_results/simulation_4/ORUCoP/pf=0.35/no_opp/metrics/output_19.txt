The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
721(1 to 6), 722(6 to 10), 723(9 to 4), 729(2 to 8), 741(5 to 12), 749(7 to 12), 750(10 to 9), 761(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(729: 125.000000), (750: 40.000000), (761: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(722: 2), (723: 9), (729: 7), (741: 4), (749: 1), (750: 7), (761: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
