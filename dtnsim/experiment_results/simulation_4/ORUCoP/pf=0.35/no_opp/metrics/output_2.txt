The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
469(1 to 6), 470(6 to 10), 471(9 to 4), 478(2 to 8), 485(5 to 12), 492(7 to 12), 493(10 to 9), 499(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(471: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(469: 1), (470: 8), (471: 9), (485: 3), (492: 4), (493: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
