The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
115(1 to 6), 116(6 to 10), 117(9 to 4), 131(2 to 8), 145(5 to 12), 155(7 to 12), 156(10 to 9), 166(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(115: 80.000000), (116: 160.000000), (117: 40.000000), (131: 0.000000), (145: 95.000000), (155: 80.000000), (166: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(115: 12), (116: 10), (117: 7), (131: 6), (145: 6), (155: 3), (166: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 69 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
