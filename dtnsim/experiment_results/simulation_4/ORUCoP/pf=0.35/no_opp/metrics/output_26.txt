The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
278(1 to 6), 279(6 to 10), 280(9 to 4), 286(2 to 8), 299(5 to 12), 310(7 to 12), 311(10 to 9), 320(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(280: 140.000000), (286: 0.000000), (310: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(279: 2), (280: 10), (286: 4), (299: 1), (310: 3), (311: 3), (320: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
