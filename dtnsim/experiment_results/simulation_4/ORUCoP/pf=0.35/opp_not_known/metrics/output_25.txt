The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
243(1 to 6), 244(6 to 10), 245(9 to 4), 271(2 to 8), 305(5 to 12), 339(7 to 12), 340(10 to 9), 363(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(244: 40.000000), (245: 0.000000), (271: 5.000000), (339: 40.000000), (340: 100.000000), (363: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 9), (244: 17), (245: 6), (271: 13), (305: 3), (339: 11), (340: 12), (363: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 510 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
