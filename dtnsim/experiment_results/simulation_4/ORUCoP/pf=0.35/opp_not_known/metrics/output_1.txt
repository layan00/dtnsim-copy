The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
780(1 to 6), 781(6 to 10), 782(9 to 4), 804(2 to 8), 827(5 to 12), 860(7 to 12), 861(10 to 9), 880(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(780: 80.000000), (781: 100.000000), (782: 0.000000), (804: 125.000000), (860: 80.000000), (861: 40.000000), (880: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(780: 10), (781: 14), (782: 6), (804: 12), (860: 7), (861: 10), (880: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 469 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
