The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
232(1 to 6), 233(6 to 10), 234(9 to 4), 250(2 to 8), 276(5 to 12), 310(7 to 12), 311(10 to 9), 329(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(232: 120.000000), (234: 80.000000), (250: 125.000000), (276: 95.000000), (310: 80.000000), (311: 40.000000), (329: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(232: 7), (233: 10), (234: 9), (250: 14), (276: 7), (310: 6), (311: 11), (329: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 530 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
