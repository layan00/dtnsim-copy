The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
766(1 to 6), 767(6 to 10), 768(9 to 4), 784(2 to 8), 822(5 to 12), 858(7 to 12), 859(10 to 9), 879(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(766: 40.000000), (767: 80.000000), (768: 80.000000), (784: 5.000000), (858: 40.000000), (859: 40.000000), (879: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(766: 4), (767: 18), (768: 6), (784: 14), (822: 2), (858: 8), (859: 9), (879: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 493 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
