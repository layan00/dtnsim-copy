The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
693(1 to 6), 694(6 to 10), 695(9 to 4), 709(2 to 8), 732(5 to 12), 765(7 to 12), 766(10 to 9), 778(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(695: 0.000000), (709: 0.000000), (732: 95.000000), (765: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(694: 7), (695: 6), (709: 4), (732: 7), (765: 9), (766: 5), (778: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 127 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
