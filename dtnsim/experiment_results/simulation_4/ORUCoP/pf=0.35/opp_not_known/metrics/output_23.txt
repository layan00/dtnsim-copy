The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1734(1 to 6), 1735(6 to 10), 1736(9 to 4), 1760(2 to 8), 1780(5 to 12), 1813(7 to 12), 1814(10 to 9), 1832(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1735: 160.000000), (1736: 120.000000), (1760: 0.000000), (1780: 95.000000), (1813: 80.000000), (1814: 40.000000), (1832: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1734: 7), (1735: 19), (1736: 9), (1760: 4), (1780: 7), (1813: 7), (1814: 11), (1832: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 508 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
