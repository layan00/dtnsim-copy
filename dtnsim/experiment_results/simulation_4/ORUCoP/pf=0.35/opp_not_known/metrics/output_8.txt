The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1726(1 to 6), 1727(6 to 10), 1728(9 to 4), 1744(2 to 8), 1760(5 to 12), 1793(7 to 12), 1794(10 to 9), 1809(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1727: 160.000000), (1728: 0.000000), (1793: 40.000000), (1794: 80.000000), (1809: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1726: 6), (1727: 12), (1728: 6), (1744: 4), (1760: 4), (1793: 11), (1794: 8), (1809: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
