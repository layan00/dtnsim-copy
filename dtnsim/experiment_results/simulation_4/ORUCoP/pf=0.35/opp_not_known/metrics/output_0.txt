The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
259(1 to 6), 260(6 to 10), 261(9 to 4), 287(2 to 8), 321(5 to 12), 355(7 to 12), 356(10 to 9), 375(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(260: 80.000000), (261: 0.000000), (287: 5.000000), (321: 95.000000), (355: 40.000000), (356: 100.000000), (375: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(259: 8), (260: 17), (261: 6), (287: 13), (321: 7), (355: 11), (356: 8), (375: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 499 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
