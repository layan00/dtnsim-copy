The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(1 to 6), 229(6 to 10), 230(9 to 4), 252(2 to 8), 276(5 to 12), 303(7 to 12), 304(10 to 9), 309(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 80.000000), (230: 0.000000), (304: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 4), (229: 14), (230: 6), (252: 2), (276: 6), (303: 4), (304: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 440 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
