The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(1 to 6), 248(6 to 10), 249(9 to 4), 275(2 to 8), 297(5 to 12), 331(7 to 12), 332(10 to 9), 355(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 40.000000), (249: 0.000000), (275: 0.000000), (297: 95.000000), (331: 40.000000), (332: 80.000000), (355: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 7), (248: 16), (249: 6), (275: 4), (297: 6), (331: 11), (332: 10), (355: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 541 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
