The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1711(1 to 6), 1712(6 to 10), 1713(9 to 4), 1735(2 to 8), 1758(5 to 12), 1793(7 to 12), 1794(10 to 9), 1810(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1711: 80.000000), (1712: 40.000000), (1713: 0.000000), (1735: 40.000000), (1758: 95.000000), (1793: 80.000000), (1794: 100.000000), (1810: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1711: 8), (1712: 12), (1713: 6), (1735: 10), (1758: 10), (1793: 8), (1794: 8), (1810: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 189 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
