The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
229(1 to 6), 230(6 to 10), 231(9 to 4), 245(2 to 8), 270(5 to 12), 306(7 to 12), 307(10 to 9), 326(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 120.000000), (306: 80.000000), (307: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(230: 8), (231: 9), (245: 14), (270: 5), (306: 7), (307: 11), (326: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 468 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
