The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
733(1 to 6), 734(6 to 10), 735(9 to 4), 753(2 to 8), 769(5 to 12), 800(7 to 12), 801(10 to 9), 813(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(733: 160.000000), (735: 0.000000), (769: 95.000000), (800: 80.000000), (801: 100.000000), (813: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(733: 3), (734: 10), (735: 6), (753: 4), (769: 10), (800: 8), (801: 12), (813: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
