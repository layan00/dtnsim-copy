The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1270(1 to 6), 1271(6 to 10), 1272(9 to 4), 1288(2 to 8), 1313(5 to 12), 1346(7 to 12), 1347(10 to 9), 1367(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1271: 160.000000), (1272: 80.000000), (1313: 95.000000), (1346: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1270: 9), (1271: 12), (1272: 6), (1288: 8), (1313: 7), (1346: 9), (1347: 6), (1367: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 162 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
