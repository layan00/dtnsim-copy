The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
656(1 to 6), 657(6 to 10), 658(9 to 4), 673(2 to 8), 683(5 to 12), 704(7 to 12), 705(10 to 9), 720(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(656: 40.000000), (657: 100.000000), (658: 0.000000), (673: 125.000000), (704: 80.000000), (705: 40.000000), (720: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(656: 6), (657: 10), (658: 6), (673: 7), (704: 16), (705: 8), (720: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
