The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
235(1 to 6), 236(6 to 10), 237(9 to 4), 255(2 to 8), 266(5 to 12), 288(7 to 12), 289(10 to 9), 307(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 80.000000), (237: 0.000000), (255: 25.000000), (266: 95.000000), (288: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(235: 9), (236: 6), (237: 6), (255: 10), (266: 8), (288: 6), (289: 10), (307: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
