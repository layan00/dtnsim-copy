The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
231(1 to 6), 232(6 to 10), 233(9 to 4), 251(2 to 8), 267(5 to 12), 288(7 to 12), 289(10 to 9), 311(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 40.000000), (232: 80.000000), (233: 0.000000), (251: 25.000000), (289: 100.000000), (311: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(231: 9), (232: 12), (233: 6), (251: 10), (267: 2), (288: 3), (289: 14), (311: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
