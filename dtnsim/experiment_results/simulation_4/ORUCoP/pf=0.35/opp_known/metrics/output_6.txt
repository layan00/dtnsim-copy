The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
583(1 to 6), 584(6 to 10), 585(9 to 4), 601(2 to 8), 615(5 to 12), 636(7 to 12), 637(10 to 9), 665(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(583: 40.000000), (585: 80.000000), (615: 95.000000), (636: 80.000000), (637: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(583: 9), (584: 8), (585: 9), (601: 5), (615: 12), (636: 11), (637: 14), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
