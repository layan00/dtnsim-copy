The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
600(1 to 6), 601(6 to 10), 602(9 to 4), 616(2 to 8), 620(5 to 12), 638(7 to 12), 639(10 to 9), 647(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(600: 160.000000), (601: 100.000000), (602: 0.000000), (620: 95.000000), (638: 80.000000), (639: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(600: 3), (601: 14), (602: 6), (620: 4), (638: 10), (639: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
