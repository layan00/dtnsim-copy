The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1021(1 to 6), 1022(6 to 10), 1023(9 to 4), 1038(2 to 8), 1046(5 to 12), 1065(7 to 12), 1066(10 to 9), 1072(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1021: 160.000000), (1023: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1021: 4), (1022: 9), (1023: 6), (1046: 3), (1065: 5), (1066: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
