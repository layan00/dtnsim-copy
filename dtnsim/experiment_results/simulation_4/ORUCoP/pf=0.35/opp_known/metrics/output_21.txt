The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
608(1 to 6), 609(6 to 10), 610(9 to 4), 624(2 to 8), 632(5 to 12), 654(7 to 12), 655(10 to 9), 678(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(608: 40.000000), (610: 0.000000), (624: 25.000000), (655: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(608: 4), (609: 9), (610: 6), (624: 6), (632: 4), (654: 12), (655: 14), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
