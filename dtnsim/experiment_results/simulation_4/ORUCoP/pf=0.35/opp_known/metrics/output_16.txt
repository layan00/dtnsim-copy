The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
572(1 to 6), 573(6 to 10), 574(9 to 4), 588(2 to 8), 595(5 to 12), 615(7 to 12), 616(10 to 9), 623(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(572: 160.000000), (573: 80.000000), (574: 0.000000), (615: 80.000000), (616: 40.000000), (623: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 3), (573: 12), (574: 6), (595: 8), (615: 5), (616: 7), (623: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
