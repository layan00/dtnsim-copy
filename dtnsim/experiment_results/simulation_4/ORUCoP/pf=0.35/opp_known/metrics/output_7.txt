The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
977(1 to 6), 978(6 to 10), 979(9 to 4), 993(2 to 8), 1000(5 to 12), 1018(7 to 12), 1019(10 to 9), 1026(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(977: 40.000000), (978: 120.000000), (979: 0.000000), (1018: 80.000000), (1026: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(977: 4), (978: 9), (979: 6), (1000: 1), (1018: 6), (1019: 2), (1026: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
