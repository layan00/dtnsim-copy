The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
959(1 to 6), 960(6 to 10), 961(9 to 4), 975(2 to 8), 982(5 to 12), 1002(7 to 12), 1003(10 to 9), 1015(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(959: 160.000000), (960: 120.000000), (961: 0.000000), (982: 135.000000), (1003: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(959: 3), (960: 13), (961: 6), (975: 6), (982: 13), (1002: 2), (1003: 7), (1015: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
