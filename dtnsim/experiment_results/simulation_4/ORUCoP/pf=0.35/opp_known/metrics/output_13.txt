The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1339(1 to 6), 1340(6 to 10), 1341(9 to 4), 1356(2 to 8), 1366(5 to 12), 1388(7 to 12), 1389(10 to 9), 1408(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1339: 40.000000), (1340: 100.000000), (1341: 0.000000), (1356: 25.000000), (1366: 95.000000), (1388: 80.000000), (1389: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1339: 5), (1340: 10), (1341: 6), (1356: 6), (1366: 14), (1388: 10), (1389: 14), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
