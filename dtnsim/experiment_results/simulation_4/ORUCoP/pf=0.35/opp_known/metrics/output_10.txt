The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 6), 221(6 to 10), 222(9 to 4), 238(2 to 8), 246(5 to 12), 267(7 to 12), 268(10 to 9), 284(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 80.000000), (221: 120.000000), (222: 80.000000), (246: 95.000000), (268: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 9), (221: 12), (222: 9), (246: 12), (267: 12), (268: 11), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
