The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(1 to 6), 248(6 to 10), 249(9 to 4), 267(2 to 8), 299(5 to 12), 321(7 to 12), 322(10 to 9), 337(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 80.000000), (248: 120.000000), (249: 0.000000), (267: 5.000000), (299: 95.000000), (321: 0.000000), (337: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 17), (248: 12), (249: 6), (267: 14), (299: 14), (321: 10), (322: 2), (337: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 645 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
