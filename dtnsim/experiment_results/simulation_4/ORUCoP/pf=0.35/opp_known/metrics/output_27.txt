The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
988(1 to 6), 989(6 to 10), 990(9 to 4), 1006(2 to 8), 1022(5 to 12), 1042(7 to 12), 1043(10 to 9), 1052(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(988: 40.000000), (989: 120.000000), (990: 80.000000), (1022: 95.000000), (1042: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(988: 9), (989: 12), (990: 6), (1006: 6), (1022: 4), (1042: 9), (1043: 3), (1052: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
