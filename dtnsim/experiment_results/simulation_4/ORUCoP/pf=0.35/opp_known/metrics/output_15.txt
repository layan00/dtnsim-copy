The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(1 to 6), 217(6 to 10), 218(9 to 4), 233(2 to 8), 246(5 to 12), 261(7 to 12), 262(10 to 9), 269(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(216: 40.000000), (217: 120.000000), (218: 0.000000), (246: 95.000000), (261: 80.000000), (262: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 5), (217: 12), (218: 6), (233: 2), (246: 13), (261: 9), (262: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
