The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
357(1 to 6), 358(6 to 10), 359(9 to 4), 365(2 to 8), 369(5 to 12), 373(7 to 12), 374(10 to 9), 377(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(357: 1), (358: 1), (359: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 357: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 359: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 358: (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 359: (to: 7, time: 0.000000), (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12:
