The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(1 to 6), 206(6 to 10), 207(9 to 4), 211(2 to 8), 213(5 to 12), 218(7 to 12), 219(10 to 9), 223(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 2), (207: 1), (213: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 206: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 213: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 206: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 207: (to: 7, time: 80.000000),
