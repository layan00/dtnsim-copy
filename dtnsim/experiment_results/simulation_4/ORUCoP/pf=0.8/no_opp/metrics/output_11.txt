The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
88(1 to 6), 89(6 to 10), 90(9 to 4), 94(2 to 8), 96(5 to 12), 98(7 to 12), 99(10 to 9), 102(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(89: 1), (90: 2), (98: 1), (99: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 89: (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 90: (to: 1, time: 100.000000), 
Bundle 98: (to: 1, time: 100.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 90: (to: 7, time: 80.000000), 
Node 10:
