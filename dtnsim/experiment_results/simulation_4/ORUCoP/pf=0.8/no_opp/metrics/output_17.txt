The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
155(1 to 6), 156(6 to 10), 157(9 to 4), 161(2 to 8), 164(5 to 12), 167(7 to 12), 168(10 to 9), 172(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(156: 2), (168: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4:
