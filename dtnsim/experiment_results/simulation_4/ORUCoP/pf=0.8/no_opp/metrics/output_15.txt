The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
42(1 to 6), 43(6 to 10), 44(9 to 4), 53(2 to 8), 64(5 to 12), 67(7 to 12), 68(10 to 9), 72(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(42: 4), (43: 2), (44: 4), (53: 2), (64: 2), (68: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 42: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
