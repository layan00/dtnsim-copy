The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(1 to 6), 181(6 to 10), 182(9 to 4), 186(2 to 8), 188(5 to 12), 191(7 to 12), 192(10 to 9), 196(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 191: (to: 1, time: 40.000000),
