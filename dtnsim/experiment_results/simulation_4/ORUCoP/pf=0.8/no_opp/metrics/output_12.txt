The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
158(1 to 6), 159(6 to 10), 160(9 to 4), 164(2 to 8), 167(5 to 12), 171(7 to 12), 172(10 to 9), 175(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(159: 2), (160: 1), (171: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 159: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 159: (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 171: (to: 1, time: 100.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 160: (to: 8, time: 60.000000), 
Node 10:
