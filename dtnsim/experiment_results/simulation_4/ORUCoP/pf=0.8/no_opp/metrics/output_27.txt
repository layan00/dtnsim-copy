The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
145(1 to 6), 146(6 to 10), 147(9 to 4), 151(2 to 8), 155(5 to 12), 159(7 to 12), 160(10 to 9), 164(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(146: 3), (147: 1), (160: 2), (164: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 164: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 146: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 164: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 146: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7:
