The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
48(1 to 6), 49(6 to 10), 50(9 to 4), 56(2 to 8), 61(5 to 12), 67(7 to 12), 68(10 to 9), 75(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(50: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(49: 5), (50: 6), (56: 4), (68: 3), (75: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
