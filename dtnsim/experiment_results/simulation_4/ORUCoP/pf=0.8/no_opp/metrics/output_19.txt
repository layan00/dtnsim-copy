The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
279(1 to 6), 280(6 to 10), 281(9 to 4), 285(2 to 8), 287(5 to 12), 291(7 to 12), 292(10 to 9), 296(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(281: 1), (291: 1), (292: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
