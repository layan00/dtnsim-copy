The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
280(1 to 6), 281(6 to 10), 282(9 to 4), 287(2 to 8), 290(5 to 12), 295(7 to 12), 296(10 to 9), 303(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(281: 1), (282: 2), (295: 1), (296: 2), (303: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 296: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 303: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 281: (to: 7, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 282: (to: 1, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 295: (to: 1, time: 40.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 282: (to: 7, time: 0.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 296: (to: 3, time: 40.000000), 
Node 11:
