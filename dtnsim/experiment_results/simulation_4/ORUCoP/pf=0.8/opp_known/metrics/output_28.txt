The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
952(1 to 6), 953(6 to 10), 954(9 to 4), 968(2 to 8), 974(5 to 12), 992(7 to 12), 993(10 to 9), 998(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(952: 80.000000), (954: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(952: 3), (953: 6), (954: 6), (992: 2), (993: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
