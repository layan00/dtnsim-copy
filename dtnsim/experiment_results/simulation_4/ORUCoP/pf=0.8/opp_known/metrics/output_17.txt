The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
671(1 to 6), 672(6 to 10), 673(9 to 4), 685(2 to 8), 688(5 to 12), 703(7 to 12), 704(10 to 9), 709(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(673: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(672: 4), (673: 6), (703: 2), (704: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
