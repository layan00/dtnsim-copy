The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(1 to 6), 181(6 to 10), 182(9 to 4), 194(2 to 8), 199(5 to 12), 217(7 to 12), 218(10 to 9), 225(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(182: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(181: 5), (182: 6), (194: 3), (217: 2), (218: 2), (225: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 194: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 20.000000),
