The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(1 to 6), 174(6 to 10), 175(9 to 4), 187(2 to 8), 192(5 to 12), 209(7 to 12), 210(10 to 9), 221(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(173: 40.000000), (175: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 5), (174: 6), (175: 9), (209: 3), (210: 2), (221: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
