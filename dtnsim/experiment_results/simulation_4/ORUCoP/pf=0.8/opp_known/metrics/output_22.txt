The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
714(1 to 6), 715(6 to 10), 716(9 to 4), 728(2 to 8), 730(5 to 12), 747(7 to 12), 748(10 to 9), 754(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(714: 160.000000), (716: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(714: 3), (715: 7), (716: 6), (730: 2), (747: 4), (748: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
