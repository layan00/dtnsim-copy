The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1264(1 to 6), 1265(6 to 10), 1266(9 to 4), 1279(2 to 8), 1284(5 to 12), 1300(7 to 12), 1301(10 to 9), 1309(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1264: 80.000000), (1266: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1264: 4), (1265: 8), (1266: 6), (1300: 2), (1301: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
