The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
692(1 to 6), 693(6 to 10), 694(9 to 4), 706(2 to 8), 709(5 to 12), 725(7 to 12), 726(10 to 9), 734(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(694: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(693: 5), (694: 6), (725: 3), (726: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
