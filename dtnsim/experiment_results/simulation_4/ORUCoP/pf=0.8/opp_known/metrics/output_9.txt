The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1241(1 to 6), 1242(6 to 10), 1243(9 to 4), 1255(2 to 8), 1261(5 to 12), 1277(7 to 12), 1278(10 to 9), 1285(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1241: 80.000000), (1242: 120.000000), (1243: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1241: 3), (1242: 10), (1243: 6), (1277: 4), (1278: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
