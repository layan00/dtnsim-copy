The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
988(1 to 6), 989(6 to 10), 990(9 to 4), 1002(2 to 8), 1007(5 to 12), 1024(7 to 12), 1025(10 to 9), 1034(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(988: 40.000000), (990: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(988: 5), (989: 4), (990: 8), (1024: 3), (1025: 2), (1034: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
