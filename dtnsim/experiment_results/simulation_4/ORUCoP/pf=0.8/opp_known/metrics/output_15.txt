The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
174(1 to 6), 175(6 to 10), 176(9 to 4), 189(2 to 8), 200(5 to 12), 215(7 to 12), 216(10 to 9), 226(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(174: 40.000000), (176: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(174: 5), (175: 5), (176: 8), (189: 2), (200: 2), (215: 2), (216: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
