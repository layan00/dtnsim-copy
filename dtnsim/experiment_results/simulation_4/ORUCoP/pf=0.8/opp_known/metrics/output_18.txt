The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
927(1 to 6), 928(6 to 10), 929(9 to 4), 941(2 to 8), 946(5 to 12), 964(7 to 12), 965(10 to 9), 970(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(928: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(928: 10), (929: 4), (946: 1), (964: 2), (965: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
