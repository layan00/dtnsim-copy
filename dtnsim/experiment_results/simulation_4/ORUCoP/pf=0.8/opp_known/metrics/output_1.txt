The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
455(1 to 6), 456(6 to 10), 457(9 to 4), 469(2 to 8), 476(5 to 12), 493(7 to 12), 494(10 to 9), 502(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(455: 80.000000), (457: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(455: 4), (456: 6), (457: 6), (469: 2), (493: 2), (494: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
