The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
445(1 to 6), 446(6 to 10), 447(9 to 4), 459(2 to 8), 464(5 to 12), 481(7 to 12), 482(10 to 9), 490(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(445: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(445: 5), (446: 5), (447: 7), (481: 2), (482: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
