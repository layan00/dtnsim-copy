The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
407(1 to 6), 408(6 to 10), 409(9 to 4), 421(2 to 8), 426(5 to 12), 444(7 to 12), 445(10 to 9), 456(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(407: 80.000000), (445: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(407: 3), (408: 5), (409: 5), (426: 1), (444: 3), (445: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
