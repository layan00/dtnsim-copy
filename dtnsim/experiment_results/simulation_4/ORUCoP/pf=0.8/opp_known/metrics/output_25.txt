The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
156(1 to 6), 157(6 to 10), 158(9 to 4), 171(2 to 8), 173(5 to 12), 190(7 to 12), 191(10 to 9), 199(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(156: 160.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(156: 4), (157: 4), (158: 4), (190: 2), (191: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 156: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 9, time: 140.000000),
