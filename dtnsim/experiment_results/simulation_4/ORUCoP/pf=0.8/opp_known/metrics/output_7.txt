The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
718(1 to 6), 719(6 to 10), 720(9 to 4), 732(2 to 8), 735(5 to 12), 751(7 to 12), 752(10 to 9), 757(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(718: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(718: 4), (719: 4), (720: 8), (735: 1), (751: 3), (752: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
