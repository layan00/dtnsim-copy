The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
675(1 to 6), 676(6 to 10), 677(9 to 4), 689(2 to 8), 693(5 to 12), 709(7 to 12), 710(10 to 9), 716(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(677: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(676: 6), (677: 6), (709: 3), (710: 3), (716: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
