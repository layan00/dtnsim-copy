The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
982(1 to 6), 983(6 to 10), 984(9 to 4), 997(2 to 8), 999(5 to 12), 1016(7 to 12), 1017(10 to 9), 1022(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(984: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(982: 1), (983: 4), (984: 6), (1016: 3), (1017: 2), (1022: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
