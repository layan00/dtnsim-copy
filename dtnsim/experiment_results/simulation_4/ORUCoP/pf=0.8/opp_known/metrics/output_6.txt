The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
449(1 to 6), 450(6 to 10), 451(9 to 4), 464(2 to 8), 472(5 to 12), 489(7 to 12), 490(10 to 9), 502(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(449: 2), (450: 6), (451: 7), (464: 2), (472: 2), (489: 4), (490: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
