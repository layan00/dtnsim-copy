The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
954(1 to 6), 955(6 to 10), 956(9 to 4), 968(2 to 8), 971(5 to 12), 987(7 to 12), 988(10 to 9), 993(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(956: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(955: 4), (956: 6), (971: 3), (987: 3), (988: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
