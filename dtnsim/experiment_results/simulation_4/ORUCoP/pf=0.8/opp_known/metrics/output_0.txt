The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(1 to 6), 173(6 to 10), 174(9 to 4), 186(2 to 8), 188(5 to 12), 206(7 to 12), 207(10 to 9), 218(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(174: 80.000000), (206: 0.000000), (218: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 4), (174: 6), (206: 10), (207: 2), (218: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 654 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
