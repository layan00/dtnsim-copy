The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1180(1 to 6), 1181(6 to 10), 1182(9 to 4), 1194(2 to 8), 1196(5 to 12), 1212(7 to 12), 1213(10 to 9), 1218(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1181: 6), (1182: 4), (1212: 3), (1213: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
