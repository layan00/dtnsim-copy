The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
711(1 to 6), 712(6 to 10), 713(9 to 4), 725(2 to 8), 727(5 to 12), 742(7 to 12), 743(10 to 9), 749(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(712: 4), (713: 4), (742: 3), (743: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
