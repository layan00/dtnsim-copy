The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1211(1 to 6), 1212(6 to 10), 1213(9 to 4), 1227(2 to 8), 1236(5 to 12), 1251(7 to 12), 1252(10 to 9), 1261(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1211: 40.000000), (1213: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1211: 5), (1212: 4), (1213: 6), (1227: 2), (1251: 5), (1252: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
