The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1328(1 to 6), 1329(6 to 10), 1330(9 to 4), 1344(2 to 8), 1362(5 to 12), 1392(7 to 12), 1393(10 to 9), 1401(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1330: 0.000000), (1401: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1329: 6), (1330: 6), (1392: 2), (1393: 3), (1401: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 158 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
