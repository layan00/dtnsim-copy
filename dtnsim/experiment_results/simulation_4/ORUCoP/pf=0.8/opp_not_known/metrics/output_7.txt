The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
969(1 to 6), 970(6 to 10), 971(9 to 4), 983(2 to 8), 998(5 to 12), 1027(7 to 12), 1028(10 to 9), 1035(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(970: 4), (971: 8), (998: 2), (1027: 3), (1028: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 210 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
