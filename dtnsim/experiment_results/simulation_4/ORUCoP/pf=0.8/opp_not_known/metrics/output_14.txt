The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1698(1 to 6), 1699(6 to 10), 1700(9 to 4), 1716(2 to 8), 1735(5 to 12), 1762(7 to 12), 1763(10 to 9), 1774(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1700: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1699: 11), (1700: 6), (1716: 2), (1762: 5), (1763: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 118 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
