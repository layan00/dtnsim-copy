The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
934(1 to 6), 935(6 to 10), 936(9 to 4), 948(2 to 8), 964(5 to 12), 992(7 to 12), 993(10 to 9), 1001(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(936: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(935: 6), (936: 6), (992: 3), (993: 4), (1001: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 151 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
