The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
569(1 to 6), 570(6 to 10), 571(9 to 4), 583(2 to 8), 597(5 to 12), 624(7 to 12), 625(10 to 9), 633(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(570: 4), (571: 4), (624: 4), (625: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 177 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
