The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(1 to 6), 186(6 to 10), 187(9 to 4), 199(2 to 8), 216(5 to 12), 245(7 to 12), 246(10 to 9), 259(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 6), (187: 4), (199: 8), (245: 3), (246: 7), (259: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 212 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
