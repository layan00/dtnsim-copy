The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1734(1 to 6), 1735(6 to 10), 1736(9 to 4), 1748(2 to 8), 1766(5 to 12), 1794(7 to 12), 1795(10 to 9), 1804(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1736: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1735: 7), (1736: 6), (1794: 4), (1795: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 148 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
