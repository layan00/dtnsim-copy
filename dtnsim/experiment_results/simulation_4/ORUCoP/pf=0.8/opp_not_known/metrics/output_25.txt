The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
168(1 to 6), 169(6 to 10), 170(9 to 4), 184(2 to 8), 198(5 to 12), 227(7 to 12), 228(10 to 9), 240(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(168: 2), (169: 4), (170: 4), (227: 4), (228: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 194 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
