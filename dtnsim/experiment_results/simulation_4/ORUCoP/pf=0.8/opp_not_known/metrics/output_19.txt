The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1687(1 to 6), 1688(6 to 10), 1689(9 to 4), 1701(2 to 8), 1715(5 to 12), 1743(7 to 12), 1744(10 to 9), 1752(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1688: 6), (1689: 4), (1743: 4), (1744: 4), (1752: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 151 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
