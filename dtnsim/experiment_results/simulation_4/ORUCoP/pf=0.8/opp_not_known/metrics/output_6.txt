The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
578(1 to 6), 579(6 to 10), 580(9 to 4), 594(2 to 8), 615(5 to 12), 644(7 to 12), 645(10 to 9), 658(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(578: 4), (579: 6), (580: 7), (594: 2), (615: 2), (644: 4), (645: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 239 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
