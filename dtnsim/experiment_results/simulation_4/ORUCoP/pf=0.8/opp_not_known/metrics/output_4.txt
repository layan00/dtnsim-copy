The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1728(1 to 6), 1729(6 to 10), 1730(9 to 4), 1744(2 to 8), 1764(5 to 12), 1792(7 to 12), 1793(10 to 9), 1801(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1730: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1728: 4), (1729: 7), (1730: 6), (1744: 2), (1792: 4), (1793: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 149 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
