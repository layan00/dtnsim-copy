The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
542(1 to 6), 543(6 to 10), 544(9 to 4), 556(2 to 8), 573(5 to 12), 604(7 to 12), 605(10 to 9), 618(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(604: 80.000000), (605: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(543: 6), (544: 5), (556: 4), (573: 2), (604: 7), (605: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
