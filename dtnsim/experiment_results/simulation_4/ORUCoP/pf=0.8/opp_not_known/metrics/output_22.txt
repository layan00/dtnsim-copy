The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
977(1 to 6), 978(6 to 10), 979(9 to 4), 991(2 to 8), 1007(5 to 12), 1036(7 to 12), 1037(10 to 9), 1048(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(979: 60.000000), (991: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(978: 6), (979: 6), (991: 4), (1007: 2), (1036: 4), (1037: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 219 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
