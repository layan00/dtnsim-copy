The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
601(1 to 6), 602(6 to 10), 603(9 to 4), 619(2 to 8), 637(5 to 12), 666(7 to 12), 667(10 to 9), 680(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(601: 120.000000), (603: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(601: 4), (602: 9), (603: 6), (619: 2), (666: 5), (667: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 183 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
