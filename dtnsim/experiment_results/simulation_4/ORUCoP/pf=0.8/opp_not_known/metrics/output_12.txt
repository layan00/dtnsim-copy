The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
927(1 to 6), 928(6 to 10), 929(9 to 4), 941(2 to 8), 956(5 to 12), 984(7 to 12), 985(10 to 9), 997(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(929: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(928: 5), (929: 6), (984: 4), (985: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 167 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
