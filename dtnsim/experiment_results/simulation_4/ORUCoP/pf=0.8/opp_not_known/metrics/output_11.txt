The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
545(1 to 6), 546(6 to 10), 547(9 to 4), 559(2 to 8), 573(5 to 12), 599(7 to 12), 600(10 to 9), 607(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(547: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(546: 6), (547: 6), (599: 4), (600: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 150 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
