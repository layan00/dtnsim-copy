The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1349(1 to 6), 1350(6 to 10), 1351(9 to 4), 1365(2 to 8), 1379(5 to 12), 1408(7 to 12), 1409(10 to 9), 1422(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1351: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1349: 2), (1350: 6), (1351: 6), (1408: 6), (1409: 5), (1422: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 134 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
