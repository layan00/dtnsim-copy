The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
589(1 to 6), 590(6 to 10), 591(9 to 4), 603(2 to 8), 618(5 to 12), 647(7 to 12), 648(10 to 9), 660(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(590: 5), (591: 7), (647: 6), (648: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 185 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
