The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
926(1 to 6), 927(6 to 10), 928(9 to 4), 940(2 to 8), 955(5 to 12), 982(7 to 12), 983(10 to 9), 991(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(928: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(927: 6), (928: 6), (982: 4), (983: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 156 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
