The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
171(1 to 6), 172(6 to 10), 173(9 to 4), 185(2 to 8), 199(5 to 12), 226(7 to 12), 227(10 to 9), 234(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(173: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 4), (173: 6), (226: 4), (227: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 194 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
