The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
255(1 to 6), 256(6 to 10), 257(9 to 4), 283(2 to 8), 314(5 to 12), 351(7 to 12), 352(10 to 9), 375(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(256: 160.000000), (257: 0.000000), (283: 5.000000), (351: 40.000000), (352: 40.000000), (375: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(255: 7), (256: 23), (257: 6), (283: 13), (314: 7), (351: 11), (352: 11), (375: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 519 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
