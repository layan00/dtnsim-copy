The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1887(1 to 6), 1888(6 to 10), 1889(9 to 4), 1915(2 to 8), 1946(5 to 12), 1981(7 to 12), 1982(10 to 9), 1996(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1887: 80.000000), (1888: 120.000000), (1889: 0.000000), (1915: 5.000000), (1982: 40.000000), (1996: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1887: 10), (1888: 16), (1889: 6), (1915: 13), (1946: 6), (1981: 3), (1982: 8), (1996: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 498 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
