The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1345(1 to 6), 1346(6 to 10), 1347(9 to 4), 1373(2 to 8), 1402(5 to 12), 1435(7 to 12), 1436(10 to 9), 1450(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1345: 80.000000), (1346: 80.000000), (1347: 0.000000), (1402: 95.000000), (1435: 40.000000), (1450: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1345: 10), (1346: 17), (1347: 6), (1373: 14), (1402: 10), (1435: 8), (1436: 4), (1450: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 470 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
