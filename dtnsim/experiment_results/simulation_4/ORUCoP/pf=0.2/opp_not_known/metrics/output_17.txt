The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1287(1 to 6), 1288(6 to 10), 1289(9 to 4), 1313(2 to 8), 1345(5 to 12), 1381(7 to 12), 1382(10 to 9), 1405(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1289: 80.000000), (1313: 5.000000), (1381: 40.000000), (1382: 40.000000), (1405: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1287: 7), (1288: 21), (1289: 6), (1313: 13), (1345: 6), (1381: 7), (1382: 10), (1405: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 509 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
