The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
754(1 to 6), 755(6 to 10), 756(9 to 4), 774(2 to 8), 798(5 to 12), 830(7 to 12), 831(10 to 9), 845(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(754: 40.000000), (756: 0.000000), (798: 95.000000), (830: 80.000000), (845: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(754: 4), (755: 12), (756: 6), (774: 4), (798: 10), (830: 8), (831: 12), (845: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 513 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
