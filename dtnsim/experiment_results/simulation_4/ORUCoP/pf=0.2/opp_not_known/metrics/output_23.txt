The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1873(1 to 6), 1874(6 to 10), 1875(9 to 4), 1899(2 to 8), 1928(5 to 12), 1964(7 to 12), 1965(10 to 9), 1987(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1874: 100.000000), (1875: 80.000000), (1899: 45.000000), (1928: 95.000000), (1964: 80.000000), (1965: 40.000000), (1987: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1873: 7), (1874: 18), (1875: 9), (1899: 17), (1928: 7), (1964: 10), (1965: 11), (1987: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 535 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
