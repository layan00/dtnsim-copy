The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
265(1 to 6), 266(6 to 10), 267(9 to 4), 293(2 to 8), 327(5 to 12), 362(7 to 12), 363(10 to 9), 382(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(265: 80.000000), (266: 120.000000), (267: 0.000000), (293: 5.000000), (327: 95.000000), (362: 40.000000), (363: 100.000000), (382: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(265: 10), (266: 17), (267: 6), (293: 13), (327: 11), (362: 14), (363: 7), (382: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 486 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
