The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
806(1 to 6), 807(6 to 10), 808(9 to 4), 826(2 to 8), 862(5 to 12), 896(7 to 12), 897(10 to 9), 917(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(806: 80.000000), (807: 160.000000), (808: 0.000000), (826: 5.000000), (862: 95.000000), (897: 40.000000), (917: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(806: 9), (807: 11), (808: 6), (826: 14), (862: 10), (896: 10), (897: 11), (917: 9), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 188 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
