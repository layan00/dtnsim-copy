The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
259(1 to 6), 260(6 to 10), 261(9 to 4), 287(2 to 8), 321(5 to 12), 358(7 to 12), 359(10 to 9), 382(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 0.000000), (287: 5.000000), (321: 95.000000), (358: 40.000000), (359: 40.000000), (382: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(259: 7), (260: 20), (261: 6), (287: 13), (321: 5), (358: 8), (359: 10), (382: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 454 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
