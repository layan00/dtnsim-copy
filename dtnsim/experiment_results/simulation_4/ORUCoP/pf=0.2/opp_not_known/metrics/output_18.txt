The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1832(1 to 6), 1833(6 to 10), 1834(9 to 4), 1860(2 to 8), 1884(5 to 12), 1920(7 to 12), 1921(10 to 9), 1944(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1833: 160.000000), (1834: 0.000000), (1860: 0.000000), (1884: 95.000000), (1920: 40.000000), (1921: 100.000000), (1944: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1832: 7), (1833: 28), (1834: 6), (1860: 4), (1884: 10), (1920: 8), (1921: 11), (1944: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 458 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
