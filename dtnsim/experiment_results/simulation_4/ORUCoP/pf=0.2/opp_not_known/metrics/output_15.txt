The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
253(1 to 6), 254(6 to 10), 255(9 to 4), 277(2 to 8), 303(5 to 12), 336(7 to 12), 337(10 to 9), 344(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(254: 40.000000), (255: 0.000000), (277: 40.000000), (344: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 4), (254: 14), (255: 6), (277: 6), (303: 6), (336: 4), (337: 2), (344: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 444 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
