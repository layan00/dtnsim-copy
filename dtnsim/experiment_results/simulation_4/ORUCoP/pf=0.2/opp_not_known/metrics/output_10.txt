The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
249(1 to 6), 250(6 to 10), 251(9 to 4), 269(2 to 8), 296(5 to 12), 332(7 to 12), 333(10 to 9), 351(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(249: 120.000000), (251: 0.000000), (269: 125.000000), (296: 95.000000), (332: 40.000000), (333: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(249: 7), (250: 11), (251: 6), (269: 12), (296: 7), (332: 10), (333: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 472 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
