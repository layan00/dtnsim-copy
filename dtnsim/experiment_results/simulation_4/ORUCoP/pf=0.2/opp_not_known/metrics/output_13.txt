The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1794(1 to 6), 1795(6 to 10), 1796(9 to 4), 1818(2 to 8), 1842(5 to 12), 1880(7 to 12), 1881(10 to 9), 1901(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1794: 80.000000), (1795: 40.000000), (1796: 0.000000), (1818: 40.000000), (1842: 95.000000), (1880: 40.000000), (1881: 80.000000), (1901: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1794: 10), (1795: 14), (1796: 6), (1818: 10), (1842: 10), (1880: 8), (1881: 11), (1901: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 524 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
