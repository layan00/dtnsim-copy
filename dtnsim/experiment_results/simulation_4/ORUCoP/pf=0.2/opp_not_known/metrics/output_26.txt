The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
805(1 to 6), 806(6 to 10), 807(9 to 4), 831(2 to 8), 864(5 to 12), 902(7 to 12), 903(10 to 9), 927(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(806: 160.000000), (807: 80.000000), (831: 5.000000), (864: 95.000000), (902: 40.000000), (903: 40.000000), (927: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(805: 7), (806: 24), (807: 7), (831: 13), (864: 7), (902: 11), (903: 11), (927: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 526 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
