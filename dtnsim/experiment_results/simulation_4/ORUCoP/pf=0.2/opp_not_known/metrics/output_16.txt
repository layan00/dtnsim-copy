The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
754(1 to 6), 755(6 to 10), 756(9 to 4), 774(2 to 8), 804(5 to 12), 839(7 to 12), 840(10 to 9), 859(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(754: 80.000000), (755: 160.000000), (756: 0.000000), (804: 95.000000), (839: 80.000000), (840: 40.000000), (859: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(754: 9), (755: 12), (756: 6), (774: 18), (804: 7), (839: 10), (840: 11), (859: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 195 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
