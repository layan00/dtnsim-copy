The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1905(1 to 6), 1906(6 to 10), 1907(9 to 4), 1925(2 to 8), 1954(5 to 12), 1991(7 to 12), 1992(10 to 9), 2006(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1905: 80.000000), (1906: 160.000000), (1907: 0.000000), (1925: 125.000000), (1954: 95.000000), (1991: 40.000000), (1992: 80.000000), (2006: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1905: 10), (1906: 12), (1907: 6), (1925: 13), (1954: 8), (1991: 8), (1992: 8), (2006: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 212 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
