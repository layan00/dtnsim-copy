The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1882(1 to 6), 1883(6 to 10), 1884(9 to 4), 1910(2 to 8), 1941(5 to 12), 1976(7 to 12), 1977(10 to 9), 2001(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1882: 160.000000), (1883: 160.000000), (1884: 0.000000), (1910: 5.000000), (1941: 95.000000), (1976: 40.000000), (1977: 100.000000), (2001: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1882: 13), (1883: 27), (1884: 6), (1910: 13), (1941: 10), (1976: 11), (1977: 7), (2001: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 528 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
