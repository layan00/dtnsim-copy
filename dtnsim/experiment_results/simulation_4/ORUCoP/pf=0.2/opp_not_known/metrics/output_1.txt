The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
813(1 to 6), 814(6 to 10), 815(9 to 4), 837(2 to 8), 861(5 to 12), 895(7 to 12), 896(10 to 9), 916(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(813: 80.000000), (814: 40.000000), (815: 0.000000), (837: 40.000000), (895: 40.000000), (896: 40.000000), (916: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(813: 10), (814: 14), (815: 6), (837: 9), (861: 6), (895: 7), (896: 10), (916: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 475 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
