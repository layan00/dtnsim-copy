The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
987(1 to 6), 988(6 to 10), 989(9 to 4), 995(2 to 8), 1010(5 to 12), 1023(7 to 12), 1024(10 to 9), 1036(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(989: 140.000000), (995: 0.000000), (1024: 40.000000), (1036: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(987: 3), (988: 4), (989: 5), (995: 6), (1010: 3), (1023: 6), (1024: 6), (1036: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
