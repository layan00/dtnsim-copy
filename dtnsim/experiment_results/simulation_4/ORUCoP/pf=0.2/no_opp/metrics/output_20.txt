The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
121(1 to 6), 122(6 to 10), 123(9 to 4), 135(2 to 8), 148(5 to 12), 159(7 to 12), 160(10 to 9), 174(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(121: 80.000000), (122: 160.000000), (123: 40.000000), (135: 0.000000), (148: 95.000000), (160: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(121: 12), (122: 6), (123: 9), (135: 6), (148: 7), (160: 8), (174: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
