The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
337(1 to 6), 338(6 to 10), 339(9 to 4), 350(2 to 8), 364(5 to 12), 377(7 to 12), 378(10 to 9), 396(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(337: 80.000000), (338: 160.000000), (339: 40.000000), (350: 0.000000), (364: 95.000000), (378: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(337: 8), (338: 6), (339: 9), (350: 6), (364: 4), (377: 6), (378: 8), (396: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
