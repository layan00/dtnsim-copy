The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
299(1 to 6), 300(6 to 10), 301(9 to 4), 308(2 to 8), 317(5 to 12), 324(7 to 12), 325(10 to 9), 328(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(317: 95.000000), (324: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(300: 7), (301: 5), (317: 4), (324: 6), (325: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
