The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
707(1 to 6), 708(6 to 10), 709(9 to 4), 720(2 to 8), 731(5 to 12), 742(7 to 12), 743(10 to 9), 753(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(708: 160.000000), (709: 40.000000), (720: 0.000000), (731: 95.000000), (742: 80.000000), (743: 100.000000), (753: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(707: 2), (708: 9), (709: 9), (720: 2), (731: 10), (742: 6), (743: 10), (753: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
