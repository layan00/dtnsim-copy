The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
340(1 to 6), 341(6 to 10), 342(9 to 4), 349(2 to 8), 363(5 to 12), 375(7 to 12), 376(10 to 9), 387(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(349: 0.000000), (363: 95.000000), (375: 80.000000), (376: 40.000000), (387: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(341: 7), (342: 8), (349: 6), (363: 5), (375: 12), (376: 6), (387: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
