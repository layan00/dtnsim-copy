The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
769(1 to 6), 770(6 to 10), 771(9 to 4), 782(2 to 8), 792(5 to 12), 803(7 to 12), 804(10 to 9), 818(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(769: 80.000000), (770: 160.000000), (771: 140.000000), (782: 0.000000), (792: 95.000000), (803: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(769: 7), (770: 9), (771: 11), (782: 4), (792: 7), (803: 9), (804: 7), (818: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
