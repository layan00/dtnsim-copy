The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
928(1 to 6), 929(6 to 10), 930(9 to 4), 936(2 to 8), 951(5 to 12), 960(7 to 12), 961(10 to 9), 968(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(929: 160.000000), (936: 0.000000), (951: 95.000000), (960: 80.000000), (961: 40.000000), (968: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(929: 9), (930: 9), (936: 6), (951: 10), (960: 6), (961: 4), (968: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
