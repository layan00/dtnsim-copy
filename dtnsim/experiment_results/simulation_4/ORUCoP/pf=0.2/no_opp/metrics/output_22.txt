The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
552(1 to 6), 553(6 to 10), 554(9 to 4), 560(2 to 8), 571(5 to 12), 581(7 to 12), 582(10 to 9), 593(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(552: 120.000000), (553: 160.000000), (554: 140.000000), (560: 0.000000), (571: 95.000000), (581: 80.000000), (582: 40.000000), (593: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(552: 4), (553: 10), (554: 8), (560: 6), (571: 5), (581: 6), (582: 6), (593: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
