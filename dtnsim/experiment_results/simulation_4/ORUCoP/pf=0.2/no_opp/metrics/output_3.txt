The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
784(1 to 6), 785(6 to 10), 786(9 to 4), 798(2 to 8), 807(5 to 12), 817(7 to 12), 818(10 to 9), 825(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(786: 40.000000), (798: 0.000000), (807: 95.000000), (817: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(784: 2), (785: 7), (786: 9), (798: 2), (807: 10), (817: 6), (825: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
