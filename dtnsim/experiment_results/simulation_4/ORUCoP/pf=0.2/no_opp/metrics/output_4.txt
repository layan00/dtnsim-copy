The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
981(1 to 6), 982(6 to 10), 983(9 to 4), 994(2 to 8), 1008(5 to 12), 1016(7 to 12), 1017(10 to 9), 1028(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(981: 80.000000), (982: 160.000000), (983: 40.000000), (994: 0.000000), (1008: 95.000000), (1016: 80.000000), (1017: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(981: 6), (982: 6), (983: 9), (994: 4), (1008: 7), (1016: 6), (1017: 8), (1028: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
