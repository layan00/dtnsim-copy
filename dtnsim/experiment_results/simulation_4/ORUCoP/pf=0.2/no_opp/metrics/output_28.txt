The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
771(1 to 6), 772(6 to 10), 773(9 to 4), 785(2 to 8), 794(5 to 12), 804(7 to 12), 805(10 to 9), 815(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(773: 140.000000), (785: 0.000000), (805: 40.000000), (815: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(771: 2), (772: 4), (773: 9), (785: 2), (794: 6), (804: 8), (805: 8), (815: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
