The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1111(1 to 6), 1112(6 to 10), 1113(9 to 4), 1131(2 to 8), 1142(5 to 12), 1162(7 to 12), 1163(10 to 9), 1169(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1111: 80.000000), (1112: 120.000000), (1113: 0.000000), (1142: 95.000000), (1162: 80.000000), (1163: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1111: 9), (1112: 12), (1113: 6), (1142: 14), (1162: 8), (1163: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
