The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
253(1 to 6), 254(6 to 10), 255(9 to 4), 273(2 to 8), 305(5 to 12), 328(7 to 12), 329(10 to 9), 346(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 80.000000), (254: 120.000000), (255: 0.000000), (273: 5.000000), (305: 95.000000), (328: 0.000000), (329: 40.000000), (346: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 17), (254: 12), (255: 6), (273: 14), (305: 14), (328: 10), (329: 7), (346: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 628 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
