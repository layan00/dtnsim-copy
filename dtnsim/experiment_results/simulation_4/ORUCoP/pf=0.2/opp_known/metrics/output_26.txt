The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
675(1 to 6), 676(6 to 10), 677(9 to 4), 693(2 to 8), 708(5 to 12), 733(7 to 12), 734(10 to 9), 765(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(675: 40.000000), (676: 80.000000), (677: 40.000000), (693: 25.000000), (708: 95.000000), (734: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(675: 9), (676: 12), (677: 9), (693: 10), (708: 4), (733: 10), (734: 14), (765: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
