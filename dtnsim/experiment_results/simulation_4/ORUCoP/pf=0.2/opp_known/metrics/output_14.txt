The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1867(1 to 6), 1868(6 to 10), 1869(9 to 4), 1884(2 to 8), 1899(5 to 12), 1923(7 to 12), 1924(10 to 9), 1950(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1867: 40.000000), (1868: 80.000000), (1869: 0.000000), (1884: 125.000000), (1899: 95.000000), (1924: 40.000000), (1950: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1867: 6), (1868: 12), (1869: 6), (1884: 10), (1899: 8), (1923: 4), (1924: 14), (1950: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
