The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1925(1 to 6), 1926(6 to 10), 1927(9 to 4), 1945(2 to 8), 1961(5 to 12), 1986(7 to 12), 1987(10 to 9), 2013(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1925: 40.000000), (1926: 80.000000), (1927: 0.000000), (1945: 25.000000), (1986: 80.000000), (1987: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1925: 9), (1926: 12), (1927: 6), (1945: 7), (1961: 3), (1986: 16), (1987: 14), (2013: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
