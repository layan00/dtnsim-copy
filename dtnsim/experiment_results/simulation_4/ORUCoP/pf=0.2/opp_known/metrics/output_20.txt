The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
253(1 to 6), 254(6 to 10), 255(9 to 4), 273(2 to 8), 285(5 to 12), 308(7 to 12), 309(10 to 9), 329(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 80.000000), (254: 80.000000), (255: 0.000000), (273: 25.000000), (285: 95.000000), (308: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 9), (254: 12), (255: 6), (273: 10), (285: 14), (308: 10), (309: 10), (329: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
