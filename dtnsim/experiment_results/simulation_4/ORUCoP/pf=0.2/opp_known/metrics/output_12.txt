The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1016(1 to 6), 1017(6 to 10), 1018(9 to 4), 1032(2 to 8), 1043(5 to 12), 1063(7 to 12), 1064(10 to 9), 1079(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1016: 40.000000), (1017: 120.000000), (1018: 0.000000), (1043: 95.000000), (1063: 120.000000), (1064: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1016: 5), (1017: 12), (1018: 6), (1032: 6), (1043: 14), (1063: 16), (1064: 11), (1079: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
