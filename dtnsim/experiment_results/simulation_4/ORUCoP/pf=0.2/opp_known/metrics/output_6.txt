The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
649(1 to 6), 650(6 to 10), 651(9 to 4), 669(2 to 8), 683(5 to 12), 705(7 to 12), 706(10 to 9), 731(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(649: 40.000000), (650: 80.000000), (651: 0.000000), (669: 125.000000), (683: 95.000000), (705: 80.000000), (706: 40.000000), (731: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(649: 9), (650: 12), (651: 6), (669: 10), (683: 14), (705: 16), (706: 14), (731: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
