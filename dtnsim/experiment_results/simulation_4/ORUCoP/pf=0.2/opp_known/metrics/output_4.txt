The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1912(1 to 6), 1913(6 to 10), 1914(9 to 4), 1932(2 to 8), 1947(5 to 12), 1967(7 to 12), 1968(10 to 9), 1981(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1912: 40.000000), (1913: 80.000000), (1914: 0.000000), (1932: 125.000000), (1967: 80.000000), (1968: 40.000000), (1981: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1912: 9), (1913: 12), (1914: 6), (1932: 7), (1947: 5), (1967: 8), (1968: 11), (1981: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
