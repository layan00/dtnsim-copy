The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(1 to 6), 248(6 to 10), 249(9 to 4), 267(2 to 8), 283(5 to 12), 307(7 to 12), 308(10 to 9), 334(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 40.000000), (248: 80.000000), (249: 0.000000), (267: 25.000000), (283: 95.000000), (307: 120.000000), (308: 40.000000), (334: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 9), (248: 12), (249: 6), (267: 10), (283: 4), (307: 16), (308: 14), (334: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
