The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
676(1 to 6), 677(6 to 10), 678(9 to 4), 692(2 to 8), 706(5 to 12), 730(7 to 12), 731(10 to 9), 758(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(676: 40.000000), (677: 80.000000), (678: 0.000000), (692: 25.000000), (706: 95.000000), (730: 80.000000), (731: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(676: 5), (677: 12), (678: 6), (692: 7), (706: 5), (730: 16), (731: 14), (758: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
