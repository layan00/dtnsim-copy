The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
686(1 to 6), 687(6 to 10), 688(9 to 4), 703(2 to 8), 716(5 to 12), 738(7 to 12), 739(10 to 9), 764(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(686: 40.000000), (687: 120.000000), (688: 0.000000), (703: 25.000000), (716: 95.000000), (738: 80.000000), (739: 40.000000), (764: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(686: 6), (687: 12), (688: 6), (703: 10), (716: 13), (738: 16), (739: 14), (764: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
