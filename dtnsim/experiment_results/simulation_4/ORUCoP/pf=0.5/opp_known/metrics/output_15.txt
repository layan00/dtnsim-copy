The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 6), 199(6 to 10), 200(9 to 4), 215(2 to 8), 228(5 to 12), 243(7 to 12), 244(10 to 9), 251(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(198: 40.000000), (200: 0.000000), (228: 95.000000), (243: 80.000000), (244: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 5), (199: 6), (200: 6), (215: 2), (228: 13), (243: 9), (244: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
