The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
528(1 to 6), 529(6 to 10), 530(9 to 4), 544(2 to 8), 550(5 to 12), 567(7 to 12), 568(10 to 9), 574(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(528: 160.000000), (529: 120.000000), (530: 0.000000), (567: 80.000000), (568: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(528: 3), (529: 9), (530: 6), (550: 5), (567: 5), (568: 7), (574: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
