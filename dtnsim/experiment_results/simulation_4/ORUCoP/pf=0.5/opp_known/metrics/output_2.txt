The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
905(1 to 6), 906(6 to 10), 907(9 to 4), 919(2 to 8), 923(5 to 12), 939(7 to 12), 940(10 to 9), 946(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(907: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(906: 9), (907: 8), (939: 4), (940: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
