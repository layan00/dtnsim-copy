The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
525(1 to 6), 526(6 to 10), 527(9 to 4), 539(2 to 8), 551(5 to 12), 572(7 to 12), 573(10 to 9), 587(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(525: 40.000000), (526: 120.000000), (527: 80.000000), (572: 80.000000), (573: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(525: 4), (526: 12), (527: 6), (539: 3), (551: 1), (572: 5), (573: 8), (587: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
