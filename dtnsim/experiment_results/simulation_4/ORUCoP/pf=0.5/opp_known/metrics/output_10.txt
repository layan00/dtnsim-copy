The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 6), 207(6 to 10), 208(9 to 4), 224(2 to 8), 227(5 to 12), 247(7 to 12), 248(10 to 9), 259(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 80.000000), (208: 80.000000), (247: 80.000000), (248: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 9), (207: 5), (208: 9), (227: 5), (247: 6), (248: 11), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
