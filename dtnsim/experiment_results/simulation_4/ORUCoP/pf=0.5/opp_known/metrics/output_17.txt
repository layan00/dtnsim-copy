The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
848(1 to 6), 849(6 to 10), 850(9 to 4), 862(2 to 8), 867(5 to 12), 888(7 to 12), 889(10 to 9), 895(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(850: 80.000000), (895: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(849: 4), (850: 8), (867: 2), (888: 3), (889: 2), (895: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
