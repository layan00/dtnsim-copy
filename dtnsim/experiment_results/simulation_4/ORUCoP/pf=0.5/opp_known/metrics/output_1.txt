The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
586(1 to 6), 587(6 to 10), 588(9 to 4), 600(2 to 8), 608(5 to 12), 627(7 to 12), 628(10 to 9), 639(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(586: 40.000000), (588: 80.000000), (600: 125.000000), (639: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(586: 4), (587: 8), (588: 8), (600: 7), (627: 4), (628: 5), (639: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
