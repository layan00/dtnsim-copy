The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1216(1 to 6), 1217(6 to 10), 1218(9 to 4), 1234(2 to 8), 1241(5 to 12), 1260(7 to 12), 1261(10 to 9), 1272(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1216: 40.000000), (1218: 120.000000), (1260: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1216: 9), (1217: 5), (1218: 9), (1234: 6), (1260: 8), (1261: 2), (1272: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
