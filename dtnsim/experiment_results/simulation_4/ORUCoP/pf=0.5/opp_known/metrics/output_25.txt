The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 6), 199(6 to 10), 200(9 to 4), 215(2 to 8), 225(5 to 12), 244(7 to 12), 245(10 to 9), 257(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(198: 40.000000), (200: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 6), (199: 4), (200: 6), (215: 3), (244: 2), (245: 6), (257: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
