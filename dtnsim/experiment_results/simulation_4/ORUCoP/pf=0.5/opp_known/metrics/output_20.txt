The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 6), 218(6 to 10), 219(9 to 4), 232(2 to 8), 240(5 to 12), 261(7 to 12), 262(10 to 9), 276(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(217: 80.000000), (219: 60.000000), (232: 25.000000), (261: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 6), (218: 6), (219: 6), (232: 10), (240: 7), (261: 6), (262: 4), (276: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
