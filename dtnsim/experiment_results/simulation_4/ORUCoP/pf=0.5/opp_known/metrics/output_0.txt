The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 6), 225(6 to 10), 226(9 to 4), 242(2 to 8), 265(5 to 12), 284(7 to 12), 285(10 to 9), 300(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 160.000000), (226: 80.000000), (242: 45.000000), (284: 0.000000), (300: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 11), (225: 10), (226: 6), (242: 15), (265: 4), (284: 10), (285: 2), (300: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 653 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
