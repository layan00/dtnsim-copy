The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
871(1 to 6), 872(6 to 10), 873(9 to 4), 885(2 to 8), 892(5 to 12), 909(7 to 12), 910(10 to 9), 917(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(871: 40.000000), (873: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(871: 4), (872: 4), (873: 9), (892: 1), (909: 3), (910: 2), (917: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
