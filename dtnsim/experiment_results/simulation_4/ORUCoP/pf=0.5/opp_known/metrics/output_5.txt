The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 6), 202(6 to 10), 203(9 to 4), 215(2 to 8), 220(5 to 12), 240(7 to 12), 241(10 to 9), 251(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 40.000000), (203: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 4), (202: 9), (203: 6), (240: 6), (241: 5), (251: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
