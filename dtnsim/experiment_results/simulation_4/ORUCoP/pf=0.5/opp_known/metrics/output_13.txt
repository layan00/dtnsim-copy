The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1202(1 to 6), 1203(6 to 10), 1204(9 to 4), 1219(2 to 8), 1227(5 to 12), 1246(7 to 12), 1247(10 to 9), 1264(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1202: 160.000000), (1203: 120.000000), (1204: 0.000000), (1219: 25.000000), (1227: 95.000000), (1246: 80.000000), (1247: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1202: 5), (1203: 10), (1204: 6), (1219: 6), (1227: 15), (1246: 10), (1247: 14), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
