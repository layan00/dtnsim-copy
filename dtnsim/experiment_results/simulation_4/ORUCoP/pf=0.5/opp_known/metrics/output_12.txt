The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
871(1 to 6), 872(6 to 10), 873(9 to 4), 885(2 to 8), 889(5 to 12), 908(7 to 12), 909(10 to 9), 920(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(871: 160.000000), (873: 80.000000), (909: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(871: 3), (872: 5), (873: 9), (908: 2), (909: 7), (920: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
