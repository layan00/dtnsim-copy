The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
715(1 to 6), 716(6 to 10), 717(9 to 4), 731(2 to 8), 753(5 to 12), 784(7 to 12), 785(10 to 9), 800(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(715: 40.000000), (717: 0.000000), (731: 40.000000), (784: 40.000000), (800: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(715: 5), (716: 7), (717: 6), (731: 10), (753: 4), (784: 8), (785: 4), (800: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
