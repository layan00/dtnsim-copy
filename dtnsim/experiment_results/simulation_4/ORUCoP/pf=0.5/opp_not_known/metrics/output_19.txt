The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2001(1 to 6), 2002(6 to 10), 2003(9 to 4), 2015(2 to 8), 2035(5 to 12), 2067(7 to 12), 2068(10 to 9), 2084(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2002: 160.000000), (2003: 120.000000), (2067: 40.000000), (2084: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2002: 9), (2003: 6), (2035: 3), (2067: 11), (2068: 5), (2084: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
