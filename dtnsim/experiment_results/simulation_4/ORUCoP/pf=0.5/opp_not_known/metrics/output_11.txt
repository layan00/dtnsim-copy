The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
694(1 to 6), 695(6 to 10), 696(9 to 4), 714(2 to 8), 729(5 to 12), 756(7 to 12), 757(10 to 9), 769(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(694: 160.000000), (696: 0.000000), (756: 80.000000), (757: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(694: 3), (695: 8), (696: 6), (714: 4), (756: 8), (757: 12), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
