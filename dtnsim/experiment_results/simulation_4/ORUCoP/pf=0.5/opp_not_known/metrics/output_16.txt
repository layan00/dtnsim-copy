The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
649(1 to 6), 650(6 to 10), 651(9 to 4), 665(2 to 8), 687(5 to 12), 716(7 to 12), 717(10 to 9), 727(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(651: 0.000000), (665: 0.000000), (716: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(650: 6), (651: 6), (665: 4), (687: 3), (716: 5), (717: 5), (727: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 144 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
