The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1173(1 to 6), 1174(6 to 10), 1175(9 to 4), 1189(2 to 8), 1205(5 to 12), 1233(7 to 12), 1234(10 to 9), 1244(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1175: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1174: 10), (1175: 8), (1233: 5), (1234: 4), (1244: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 295 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
