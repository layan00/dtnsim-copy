The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1602(1 to 6), 1603(6 to 10), 1604(9 to 4), 1622(2 to 8), 1643(5 to 12), 1675(7 to 12), 1676(10 to 9), 1692(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1602: 80.000000), (1603: 100.000000), (1604: 0.000000), (1622: 40.000000), (1643: 95.000000), (1675: 80.000000), (1676: 100.000000), (1692: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1602: 8), (1603: 14), (1604: 6), (1622: 10), (1643: 6), (1675: 8), (1676: 12), (1692: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 201 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
