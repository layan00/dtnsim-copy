The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
666(1 to 6), 667(6 to 10), 668(9 to 4), 684(2 to 8), 722(5 to 12), 756(7 to 12), 757(10 to 9), 774(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(666: 40.000000), (667: 160.000000), (668: 80.000000), (684: 5.000000), (756: 80.000000), (757: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(666: 5), (667: 18), (668: 6), (684: 14), (722: 2), (756: 9), (757: 9), (774: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 479 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
