The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1600(1 to 6), 1601(6 to 10), 1602(9 to 4), 1616(2 to 8), 1633(5 to 12), 1665(7 to 12), 1666(10 to 9), 1675(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1602: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1600: 2), (1601: 6), (1602: 9), (1633: 3), (1665: 6), (1666: 4), (1675: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 191 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
