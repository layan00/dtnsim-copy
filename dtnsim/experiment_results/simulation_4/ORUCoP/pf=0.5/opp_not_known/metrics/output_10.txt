The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 6), 219(6 to 10), 220(9 to 4), 236(2 to 8), 259(5 to 12), 291(7 to 12), 292(10 to 9), 310(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 160.000000), (220: 80.000000), (236: 125.000000), (291: 80.000000), (292: 80.000000), (310: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 7), (219: 9), (220: 9), (236: 14), (259: 5), (291: 6), (292: 11), (310: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 523 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
