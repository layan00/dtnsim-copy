The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
229(1 to 6), 230(6 to 10), 231(9 to 4), 251(2 to 8), 272(5 to 12), 305(7 to 12), 306(10 to 9), 327(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 80.000000), (230: 40.000000), (231: 80.000000), (305: 40.000000), (306: 80.000000), (327: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(229: 12), (230: 12), (231: 7), (251: 11), (272: 6), (305: 11), (306: 8), (327: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 237 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
