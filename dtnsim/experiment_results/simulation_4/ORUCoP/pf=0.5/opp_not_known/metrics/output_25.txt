The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 6), 211(6 to 10), 212(9 to 4), 228(2 to 8), 251(5 to 12), 282(7 to 12), 283(10 to 9), 300(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 6), (211: 5), (212: 6), (228: 4), (282: 7), (283: 8), (300: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 185 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
