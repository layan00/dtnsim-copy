The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2095(1 to 6), 2096(6 to 10), 2097(9 to 4), 2113(2 to 8), 2138(5 to 12), 2172(7 to 12), 2173(10 to 9), 2190(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2095: 120.000000), (2097: 80.000000), (2113: 125.000000), (2173: 40.000000), (2190: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2095: 7), (2096: 9), (2097: 7), (2113: 12), (2138: 4), (2172: 8), (2173: 7), (2190: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 520 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
