The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(1 to 6), 214(6 to 10), 215(9 to 4), 229(2 to 8), 253(5 to 12), 285(7 to 12), 286(10 to 9), 303(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 120.000000), (286: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 12), (215: 9), (229: 8), (285: 6), (286: 10), (303: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 513 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
