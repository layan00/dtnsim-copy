The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
471(1 to 6), 472(6 to 10), 473(9 to 4), 480(2 to 8), 488(5 to 12), 495(7 to 12), 496(10 to 9), 500(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(472: 160.000000), (473: 140.000000), (480: 125.000000), (488: 95.000000), (495: 80.000000), (496: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(471: 2), (472: 10), (473: 6), (480: 8), (488: 6), (495: 3), (496: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
