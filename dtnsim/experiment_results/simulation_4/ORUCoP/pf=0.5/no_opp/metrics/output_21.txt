The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
245(1 to 6), 246(6 to 10), 247(9 to 4), 252(2 to 8), 260(5 to 12), 267(7 to 12), 268(10 to 9), 275(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(252: 125.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 4), (247: 3), (252: 8), (260: 4), (267: 2), (268: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
