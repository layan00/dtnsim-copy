The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 6), 215(6 to 10), 216(9 to 4), 223(2 to 8), 226(5 to 12), 229(7 to 12), 230(10 to 9), 233(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 4), (216: 2), (229: 1), (230: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 215: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 215: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), (to: 7, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 215: (to: 1, time: 100.000000), 
Bundle 216: (to: 1, time: 0.000000),
