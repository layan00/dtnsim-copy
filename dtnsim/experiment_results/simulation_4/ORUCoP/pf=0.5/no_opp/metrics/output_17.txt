The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
313(1 to 6), 314(6 to 10), 315(9 to 4), 319(2 to 8), 326(5 to 12), 335(7 to 12), 336(10 to 9), 342(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(319: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(314: 3), (319: 2), (326: 2), (335: 1), (336: 3), (342: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2:
