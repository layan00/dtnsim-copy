The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
74(1 to 6), 75(6 to 10), 76(9 to 4), 82(2 to 8), 86(5 to 12), 94(7 to 12), 95(10 to 9), 104(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 25.000000), (94: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(74: 1), (75: 6), (76: 4), (82: 2), (86: 3), (94: 6), (95: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
