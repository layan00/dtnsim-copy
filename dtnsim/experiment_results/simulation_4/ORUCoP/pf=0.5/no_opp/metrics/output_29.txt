The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
598(1 to 6), 599(6 to 10), 600(9 to 4), 605(2 to 8), 617(5 to 12), 624(7 to 12), 625(10 to 9), 631(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(600: 140.000000), (605: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(598: 2), (599: 1), (600: 5), (605: 3), (625: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 598: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 598: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 600: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Bundle 605: (to: 12, time: 15.000000), (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 600: (to: 4, time: 140.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 599: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 600: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 600: (to: 1, time: 20.000000), (to: 8, time: 20.000000),
