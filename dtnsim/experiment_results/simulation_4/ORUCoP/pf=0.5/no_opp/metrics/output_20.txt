The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
85(1 to 6), 86(6 to 10), 87(9 to 4), 96(2 to 8), 106(5 to 12), 115(7 to 12), 116(10 to 9), 130(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(85: 80.000000), (86: 160.000000), (87: 40.000000), (116: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(85: 10), (86: 7), (87: 6), (96: 9), (106: 5), (116: 7), (130: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
