The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
441(1 to 6), 442(6 to 10), 443(9 to 4), 448(2 to 8), 451(5 to 12), 459(7 to 12), 460(10 to 9), 467(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(441: 1), (442: 2), (443: 2), (460: 3), (467: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 441: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 443: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 460: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 467: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 442: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 443: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 460: (to: 3, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 60.000000),
