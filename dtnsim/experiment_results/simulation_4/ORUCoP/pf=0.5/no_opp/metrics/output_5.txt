The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
69(1 to 6), 70(6 to 10), 71(9 to 4), 76(2 to 8), 81(5 to 12), 89(7 to 12), 90(10 to 9), 96(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(90: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 1), (71: 2), (76: 1), (90: 4), (96: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 90: (to: 9, time: 140.000000), 
Bundle 96: (to: 9, time: 140.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 76: (to: 12, time: 15.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 90: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 96: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 90: (to: 1, time: 80.000000),
