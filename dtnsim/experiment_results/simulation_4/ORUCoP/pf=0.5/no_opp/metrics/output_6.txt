The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(1 to 6), 197(6 to 10), 198(9 to 4), 203(2 to 8), 215(5 to 12), 221(7 to 12), 222(10 to 9), 230(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 2), (197: 4), (198: 4), (203: 2), (215: 2), (221: 3), (222: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
