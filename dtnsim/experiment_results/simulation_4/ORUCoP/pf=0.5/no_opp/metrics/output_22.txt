The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
383(1 to 6), 384(6 to 10), 385(9 to 4), 390(2 to 8), 397(5 to 12), 404(7 to 12), 405(10 to 9), 411(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(390: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(384: 5), (385: 2), (390: 3), (397: 3), (404: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 390: (to: 12, time: 15.000000), (to: 3, time: 20.000000),

Node 4: 
Bundle 384: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 397: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5:
