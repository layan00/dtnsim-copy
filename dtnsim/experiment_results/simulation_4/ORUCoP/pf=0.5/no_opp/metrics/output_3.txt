The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
486(1 to 6), 487(6 to 10), 488(9 to 4), 493(2 to 8), 498(5 to 12), 505(7 to 12), 506(10 to 9), 510(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(486: 1), (487: 3), (488: 2), (498: 2), (505: 1), (510: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 486: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
