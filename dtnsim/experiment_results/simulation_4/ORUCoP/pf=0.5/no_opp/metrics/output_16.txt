The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
195(1 to 6), 196(6 to 10), 197(9 to 4), 202(2 to 8), 210(5 to 12), 215(7 to 12), 216(10 to 9), 222(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 0.000000), (215: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 1), (197: 2), (202: 2), (210: 3), (215: 3), (216: 5), (222: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 215: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 202: (to: 12, time: 15.000000),
