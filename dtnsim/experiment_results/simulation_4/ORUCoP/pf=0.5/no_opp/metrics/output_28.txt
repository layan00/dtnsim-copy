The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
466(1 to 6), 467(6 to 10), 468(9 to 4), 474(2 to 8), 482(5 to 12), 491(7 to 12), 492(10 to 9), 500(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(474: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(466: 1), (467: 3), (468: 3), (474: 2), (482: 1), (491: 1), (492: 2), (500: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 466: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
