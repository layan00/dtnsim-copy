The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
513(1 to 6), 514(6 to 10), 515(9 to 4), 524(2 to 8), 534(5 to 12), 541(7 to 12), 542(10 to 9), 554(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(513: 80.000000), (514: 160.000000), (515: 40.000000), (524: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(513: 6), (514: 10), (515: 6), (524: 4), (541: 4), (542: 2), (554: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
