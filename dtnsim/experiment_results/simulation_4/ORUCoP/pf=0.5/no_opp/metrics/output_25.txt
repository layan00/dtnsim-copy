The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(1 to 6), 67(6 to 10), 68(9 to 4), 74(2 to 8), 84(5 to 12), 91(7 to 12), 92(10 to 9), 97(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 3), (67: 2), (68: 1), (74: 3), (92: 2), (97: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 66: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 66: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 74: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 66: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 74: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 97: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 67: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), (to: 7, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 68: (to: 1, time: 20.000000), 
Node 10:
