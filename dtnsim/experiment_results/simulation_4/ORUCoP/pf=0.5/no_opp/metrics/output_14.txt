The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
630(1 to 6), 631(6 to 10), 632(9 to 4), 639(2 to 8), 648(5 to 12), 655(7 to 12), 656(10 to 9), 668(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(630: 120.000000), (656: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(630: 4), (631: 5), (632: 5), (639: 5), (655: 3), (656: 4), (668: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
