The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
92(1 to 6), 93(6 to 10), 94(9 to 4), 107(2 to 8), 117(5 to 12), 124(7 to 12), 125(10 to 9), 134(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(92: 120.000000), (93: 160.000000), (94: 40.000000), (107: 0.000000), (134: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(92: 12), (93: 5), (94: 7), (107: 6), (117: 4), (134: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 71 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
