The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
329(1 to 6), 330(6 to 10), 331(9 to 4), 337(2 to 8), 346(5 to 12), 351(7 to 12), 352(10 to 9), 355(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(337: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(330: 2), (331: 3), (337: 2), (346: 1), (355: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 331: (to: 9, time: 20.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 337: (to: 12, time: 15.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 355: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 346: (to: 4, time: 25.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 330: (to: 7, time: 60.000000), (to: 7, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 331: (to: 1, time: 0.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 331: (to: 7, time: 0.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11:
