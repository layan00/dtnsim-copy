The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(1 to 6), 247(6 to 10), 248(9 to 4), 254(2 to 8), 262(5 to 12), 269(7 to 12), 270(10 to 9), 276(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(254: 125.000000), (270: 40.000000), (276: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 3), (248: 5), (254: 6), (270: 4), (276: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
