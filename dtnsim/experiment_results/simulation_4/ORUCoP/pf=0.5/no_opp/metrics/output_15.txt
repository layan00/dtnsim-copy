The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(1 to 6), 67(6 to 10), 68(9 to 4), 78(2 to 8), 91(5 to 12), 94(7 to 12), 95(10 to 9), 99(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(95: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 4), (67: 4), (68: 5), (78: 2), (91: 4), (94: 1), (95: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
