The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
559(1 to 6), 560(6 to 10), 561(9 to 4), 566(2 to 8), 575(5 to 12), 585(7 to 12), 586(10 to 9), 594(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(566: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(560: 3), (561: 3), (566: 2), (585: 2), (594: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 566: (to: 12, time: 15.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 594: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 560: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), (to: 7, time: 40.000000), 
Node 7:

Bundle 585: (to: 1, time: 40.000000), (to: 1, time: 40.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 561: (to: 2, time: 40.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 561: (to: 1, time: 20.000000), (to: 8, time: 20.000000), 
Node 10:
