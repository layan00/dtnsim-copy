The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
482(1 to 6), 483(6 to 10), 484(9 to 4), 496(2 to 8), 499(5 to 12), 515(7 to 12), 516(10 to 9), 522(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(482: 160.000000), (484: 120.000000), (516: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(482: 3), (483: 4), (484: 6), (499: 2), (515: 3), (516: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
