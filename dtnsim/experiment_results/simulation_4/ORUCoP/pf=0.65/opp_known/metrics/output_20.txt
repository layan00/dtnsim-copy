The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 6), 203(6 to 10), 204(9 to 4), 216(2 to 8), 221(5 to 12), 241(7 to 12), 242(10 to 9), 249(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 80.000000), (204: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 3), (203: 5), (204: 6), (216: 6), (241: 2), (242: 3), (249: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
