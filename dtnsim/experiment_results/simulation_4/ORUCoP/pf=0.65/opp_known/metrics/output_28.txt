The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1058(1 to 6), 1059(6 to 10), 1060(9 to 4), 1078(2 to 8), 1085(5 to 12), 1104(7 to 12), 1105(10 to 9), 1111(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1058: 80.000000), (1060: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1058: 8), (1059: 6), (1060: 6), (1085: 1), (1104: 2), (1105: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
