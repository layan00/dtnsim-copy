The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1073(1 to 6), 1074(6 to 10), 1075(9 to 4), 1088(2 to 8), 1090(5 to 12), 1108(7 to 12), 1109(10 to 9), 1114(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1075: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1073: 1), (1074: 4), (1075: 6), (1108: 3), (1109: 3), (1114: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
