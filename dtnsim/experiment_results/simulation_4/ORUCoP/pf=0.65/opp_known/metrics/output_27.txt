The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
757(1 to 6), 758(6 to 10), 759(9 to 4), 771(2 to 8), 779(5 to 12), 796(7 to 12), 797(10 to 9), 803(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(759: 80.000000), (796: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(758: 8), (759: 6), (796: 6), (797: 3), (803: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
