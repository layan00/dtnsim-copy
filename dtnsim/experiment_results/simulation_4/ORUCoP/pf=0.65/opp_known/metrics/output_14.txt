The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1426(1 to 6), 1427(6 to 10), 1428(9 to 4), 1442(2 to 8), 1450(5 to 12), 1468(7 to 12), 1469(10 to 9), 1478(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1426: 40.000000), (1428: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1426: 4), (1427: 6), (1428: 6), (1442: 3), (1468: 5), (1469: 2), (1478: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
