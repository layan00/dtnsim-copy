The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
184(1 to 6), 185(6 to 10), 186(9 to 4), 199(2 to 8), 212(5 to 12), 227(7 to 12), 228(10 to 9), 235(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(184: 40.000000), (186: 80.000000), (227: 80.000000), (228: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(184: 5), (185: 6), (186: 6), (199: 2), (212: 2), (227: 7), (228: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
