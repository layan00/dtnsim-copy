The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1049(1 to 6), 1050(6 to 10), 1051(9 to 4), 1064(2 to 8), 1074(5 to 12), 1094(7 to 12), 1095(10 to 9), 1104(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1049: 40.000000), (1050: 120.000000), (1094: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1049: 4), (1050: 12), (1051: 4), (1074: 1), (1094: 5), (1095: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
