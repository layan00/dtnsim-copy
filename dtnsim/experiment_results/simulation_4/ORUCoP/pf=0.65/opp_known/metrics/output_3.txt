The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1042(1 to 6), 1043(6 to 10), 1044(9 to 4), 1056(2 to 8), 1061(5 to 12), 1078(7 to 12), 1079(10 to 9), 1084(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1042: 160.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1042: 3), (1043: 6), (1044: 4), (1061: 2), (1078: 4), (1079: 2), (1084: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
