The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
182(1 to 6), 183(6 to 10), 184(9 to 4), 196(2 to 8), 201(5 to 12), 218(7 to 12), 219(10 to 9), 226(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(182: 40.000000), (184: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(182: 4), (183: 9), (184: 6), (218: 6), (219: 2), (226: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
