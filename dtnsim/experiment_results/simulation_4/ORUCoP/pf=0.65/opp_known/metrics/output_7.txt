The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
787(1 to 6), 788(6 to 10), 789(9 to 4), 801(2 to 8), 807(5 to 12), 824(7 to 12), 825(10 to 9), 832(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(787: 40.000000), (789: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(787: 4), (788: 4), (789: 9), (807: 1), (824: 3), (825: 2), (832: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
