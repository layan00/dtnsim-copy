The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
190(1 to 6), 191(6 to 10), 192(9 to 4), 204(2 to 8), 209(5 to 12), 228(7 to 12), 229(10 to 9), 242(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(190: 40.000000), (192: 80.000000), (228: 0.000000), (242: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(190: 4), (191: 4), (192: 6), (228: 10), (229: 2), (242: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 657 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
