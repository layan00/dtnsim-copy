The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1338(1 to 6), 1339(6 to 10), 1340(9 to 4), 1352(2 to 8), 1359(5 to 12), 1377(7 to 12), 1378(10 to 9), 1386(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1338: 40.000000), (1339: 120.000000), (1340: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1338: 3), (1339: 10), (1340: 6), (1359: 2), (1377: 3), (1378: 2), (1386: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
