The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
499(1 to 6), 500(6 to 10), 501(9 to 4), 513(2 to 8), 520(5 to 12), 538(7 to 12), 539(10 to 9), 548(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(499: 80.000000), (501: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(499: 4), (500: 6), (501: 8), (513: 3), (538: 2), (539: 5), (548: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
