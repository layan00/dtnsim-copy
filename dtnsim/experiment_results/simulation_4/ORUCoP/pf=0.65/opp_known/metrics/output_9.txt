The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1358(1 to 6), 1359(6 to 10), 1360(9 to 4), 1374(2 to 8), 1383(5 to 12), 1402(7 to 12), 1403(10 to 9), 1413(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1358: 40.000000), (1359: 120.000000), (1360: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1358: 5), (1359: 10), (1360: 6), (1402: 4), (1403: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
