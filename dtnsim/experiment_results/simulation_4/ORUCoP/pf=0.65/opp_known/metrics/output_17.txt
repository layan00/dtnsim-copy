The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
761(1 to 6), 762(6 to 10), 763(9 to 4), 775(2 to 8), 779(5 to 12), 795(7 to 12), 796(10 to 9), 801(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(763: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(762: 4), (763: 8), (779: 2), (795: 2), (796: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
