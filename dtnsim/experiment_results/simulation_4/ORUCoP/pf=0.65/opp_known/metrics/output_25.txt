The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
169(1 to 6), 170(6 to 10), 171(9 to 4), 184(2 to 8), 191(5 to 12), 209(7 to 12), 210(10 to 9), 218(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(169: 160.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(169: 5), (170: 4), (171: 4), (184: 2), (209: 2), (210: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
