The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
190(1 to 6), 191(6 to 10), 192(9 to 4), 197(2 to 8), 205(5 to 12), 212(7 to 12), 213(10 to 9), 220(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(197: 125.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 4), (192: 3), (197: 8), (205: 4), (212: 2), (213: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
