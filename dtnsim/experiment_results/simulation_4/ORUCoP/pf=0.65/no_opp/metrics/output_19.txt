The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
425(1 to 6), 426(6 to 10), 427(9 to 4), 431(2 to 8), 437(5 to 12), 443(7 to 12), 444(10 to 9), 450(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(427: 4), (437: 2), (443: 2), (444: 2), (450: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 427: (to: 3, time: 120.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 444: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 450: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 437: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
