The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
58(1 to 6), 59(6 to 10), 60(9 to 4), 65(2 to 8), 69(5 to 12), 76(7 to 12), 77(10 to 9), 80(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(59: 2), (60: 1), (80: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 80 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 80: (to: 9, time: 140.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 80: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), (to: 10, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 59: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 80: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 59: (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 60: (to: 7, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 80: (to: 8, time: 140.000000),
