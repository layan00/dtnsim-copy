The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
333(1 to 6), 334(6 to 10), 335(9 to 4), 341(2 to 8), 349(5 to 12), 357(7 to 12), 358(10 to 9), 365(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(357: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(333: 1), (335: 5), (349: 1), (357: 3), (358: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 333: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
