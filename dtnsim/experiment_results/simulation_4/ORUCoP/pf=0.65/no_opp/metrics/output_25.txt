The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
37(1 to 6), 38(6 to 10), 39(9 to 4), 44(2 to 8), 51(5 to 12), 57(7 to 12), 58(10 to 9), 61(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(37: 2), (44: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 37: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 37: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 44: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7:
