The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
315(1 to 6), 316(6 to 10), 317(9 to 4), 322(2 to 8), 327(5 to 12), 334(7 to 12), 335(10 to 9), 342(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(316: 5), (317: 2), (322: 3), (327: 3), (334: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
