The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
428(1 to 6), 429(6 to 10), 430(9 to 4), 436(2 to 8), 442(5 to 12), 448(7 to 12), 449(10 to 9), 456(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(429: 4), (430: 5), (436: 3), (448: 5), (449: 2), (456: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
