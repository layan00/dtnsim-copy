The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
542(1 to 6), 543(6 to 10), 544(9 to 4), 550(2 to 8), 554(5 to 12), 561(7 to 12), 562(10 to 9), 568(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(542: 1), (543: 2), (544: 4), (561: 2), (568: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 542: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
