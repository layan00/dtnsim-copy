The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
326(1 to 6), 327(6 to 10), 328(9 to 4), 332(2 to 8), 337(5 to 12), 342(7 to 12), 343(10 to 9), 347(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(327: 2), (328: 2), (337: 2), (342: 2), (347: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 347: (to: 9, time: 140.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 347: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 337: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 347: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 337: (to: 4, time: 25.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 327: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), 
Node 7:

Bundle 342: (to: 1, time: 100.000000), (to: 1, time: 100.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9:
