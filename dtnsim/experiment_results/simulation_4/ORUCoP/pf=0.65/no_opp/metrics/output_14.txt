The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
482(1 to 6), 483(6 to 10), 484(9 to 4), 490(2 to 8), 497(5 to 12), 503(7 to 12), 504(10 to 9), 513(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(483: 5), (484: 5), (490: 5), (503: 4), (513: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
