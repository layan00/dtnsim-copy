The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
424(1 to 6), 425(6 to 10), 426(9 to 4), 431(2 to 8), 438(5 to 12), 445(7 to 12), 446(10 to 9), 454(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(425: 3), (426: 3), (445: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
