The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
148(1 to 6), 149(6 to 10), 150(9 to 4), 155(2 to 8), 163(5 to 12), 168(7 to 12), 169(10 to 9), 174(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(148: 2), (149: 2), (150: 2), (155: 2), (163: 2), (168: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 148: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 168: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 148: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 155: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 163: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 149: (to: 7, time: 60.000000), (to: 7, time: 100.000000), 
Node 7:
