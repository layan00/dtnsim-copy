The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
156(1 to 6), 157(6 to 10), 158(9 to 4), 165(2 to 8), 168(5 to 12), 171(7 to 12), 172(10 to 9), 175(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(157: 4), (158: 2), (171: 2), (172: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 157: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), (to: 1, time: 80.000000),
