The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
372(1 to 6), 373(6 to 10), 374(9 to 4), 381(2 to 8), 384(5 to 12), 390(7 to 12), 391(10 to 9), 394(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(374: 140.000000), (384: 95.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(372: 1), (373: 5), (374: 5), (384: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
