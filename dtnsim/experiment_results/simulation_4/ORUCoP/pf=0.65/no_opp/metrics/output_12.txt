The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
260(1 to 6), 261(6 to 10), 262(9 to 4), 267(2 to 8), 271(5 to 12), 277(7 to 12), 278(10 to 9), 283(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(278: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(261: 2), (262: 3), (277: 2), (278: 4), (283: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
