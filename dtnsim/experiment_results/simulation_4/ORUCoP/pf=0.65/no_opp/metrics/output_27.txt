The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(1 to 6), 228(6 to 10), 229(9 to 4), 233(2 to 8), 241(5 to 12), 246(7 to 12), 247(10 to 9), 251(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 4), (229: 4), (247: 2), (251: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 228: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Bundle 229: (to: 2, time: 100.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 251: (to: 4, time: 55.000000), 
Node 4:
