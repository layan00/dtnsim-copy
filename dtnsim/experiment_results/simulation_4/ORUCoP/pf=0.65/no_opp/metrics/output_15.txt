The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
52(1 to 6), 53(6 to 10), 54(9 to 4), 63(2 to 8), 76(5 to 12), 79(7 to 12), 80(10 to 9), 84(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(52: 4), (53: 3), (54: 5), (63: 2), (76: 2), (79: 2), (80: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
