The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(1 to 6), 195(6 to 10), 196(9 to 4), 208(2 to 8), 226(5 to 12), 255(7 to 12), 256(10 to 9), 269(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(196: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(195: 7), (196: 6), (208: 8), (255: 2), (256: 7), (269: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 210 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
