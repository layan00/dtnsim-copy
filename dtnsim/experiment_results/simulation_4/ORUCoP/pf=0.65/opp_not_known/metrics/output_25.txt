The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
181(1 to 6), 182(6 to 10), 183(9 to 4), 197(2 to 8), 217(5 to 12), 247(7 to 12), 248(10 to 9), 262(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(181: 4), (182: 4), (183: 4), (197: 2), (247: 6), (248: 8), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 177 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
