The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1441(1 to 6), 1442(6 to 10), 1443(9 to 4), 1461(2 to 8), 1482(5 to 12), 1514(7 to 12), 1515(10 to 9), 1526(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1443: 0.000000), (1461: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1441: 7), (1442: 6), (1443: 6), (1461: 4), (1482: 4), (1514: 2), (1515: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 189 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
