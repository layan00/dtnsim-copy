The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1868(1 to 6), 1869(6 to 10), 1870(9 to 4), 1884(2 to 8), 1903(5 to 12), 1934(7 to 12), 1935(10 to 9), 1945(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1870: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1869: 7), (1870: 6), (1934: 4), (1935: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 122 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
