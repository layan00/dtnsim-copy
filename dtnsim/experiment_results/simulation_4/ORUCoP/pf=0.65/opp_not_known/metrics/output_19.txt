The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1835(1 to 6), 1836(6 to 10), 1837(9 to 4), 1849(2 to 8), 1867(5 to 12), 1897(7 to 12), 1898(10 to 9), 1908(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1836: 160.000000), (1837: 120.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1836: 9), (1837: 6), (1867: 2), (1897: 4), (1898: 5), (1908: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 129 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
