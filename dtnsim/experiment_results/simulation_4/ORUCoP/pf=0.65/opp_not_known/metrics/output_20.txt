The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 6), 215(6 to 10), 216(9 to 4), 232(2 to 8), 249(5 to 12), 281(7 to 12), 282(10 to 9), 297(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 120.000000), (216: 80.000000), (282: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 3), (215: 13), (216: 6), (232: 6), (281: 7), (282: 8), (297: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 191 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
