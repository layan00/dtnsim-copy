The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1446(1 to 6), 1447(6 to 10), 1448(9 to 4), 1460(2 to 8), 1477(5 to 12), 1507(7 to 12), 1508(10 to 9), 1515(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1447: 6), (1448: 4), (1477: 3), (1507: 4), (1508: 4), (1515: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 178 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
