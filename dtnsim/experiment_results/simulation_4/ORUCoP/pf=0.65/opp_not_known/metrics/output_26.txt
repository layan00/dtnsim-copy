The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
592(1 to 6), 593(6 to 10), 594(9 to 4), 610(2 to 8), 635(5 to 12), 666(7 to 12), 667(10 to 9), 682(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(592: 40.000000), (594: 80.000000), (666: 80.000000), (667: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(592: 4), (593: 13), (594: 6), (610: 2), (635: 2), (666: 8), (667: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 166 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
