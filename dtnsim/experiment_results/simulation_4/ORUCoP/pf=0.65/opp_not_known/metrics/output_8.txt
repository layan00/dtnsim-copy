The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1457(1 to 6), 1458(6 to 10), 1459(9 to 4), 1473(2 to 8), 1487(5 to 12), 1517(7 to 12), 1518(10 to 9), 1531(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1459: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1457: 6), (1458: 6), (1459: 6), (1473: 4), (1517: 6), (1518: 5), (1531: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 130 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
