The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
612(1 to 6), 613(6 to 10), 614(9 to 4), 626(2 to 8), 645(5 to 12), 673(7 to 12), 674(10 to 9), 683(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(614: 120.000000), (626: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(613: 5), (614: 6), (626: 4), (645: 2), (673: 4), (674: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 147 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
