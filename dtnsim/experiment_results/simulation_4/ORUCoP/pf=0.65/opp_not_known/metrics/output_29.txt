The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1872(1 to 6), 1873(6 to 10), 1874(9 to 4), 1890(2 to 8), 1918(5 to 12), 1948(7 to 12), 1949(10 to 9), 1970(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1873: 160.000000), (1948: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1872: 10), (1873: 9), (1874: 4), (1890: 8), (1948: 11), (1949: 4), (1970: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
