The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
643(1 to 6), 644(6 to 10), 645(9 to 4), 661(2 to 8), 679(5 to 12), 709(7 to 12), 710(10 to 9), 726(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(643: 120.000000), (645: 80.000000), (661: 125.000000), (710: 40.000000), (726: 85.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(643: 5), (644: 14), (645: 9), (661: 7), (709: 6), (710: 9), (726: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 212 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
