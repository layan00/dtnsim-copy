The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1969(1 to 6), 1970(6 to 10), 1971(9 to 4), 1987(2 to 8), 2003(5 to 12), 2034(7 to 12), 2035(10 to 9), 2051(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1971: 80.000000), (2035: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1969: 7), (1970: 12), (1971: 6), (1987: 4), (2034: 5), (2035: 7), (2051: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 198 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
