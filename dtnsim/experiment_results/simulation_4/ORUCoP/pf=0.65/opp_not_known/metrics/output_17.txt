The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1008(1 to 6), 1009(6 to 10), 1010(9 to 4), 1022(2 to 8), 1040(5 to 12), 1069(7 to 12), 1070(10 to 9), 1082(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1010: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1009: 6), (1010: 8), (1022: 6), (1040: 3), (1069: 2), (1070: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 231 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
