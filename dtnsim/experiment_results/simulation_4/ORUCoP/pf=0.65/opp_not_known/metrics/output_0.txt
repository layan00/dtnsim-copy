The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 6), 203(6 to 10), 204(9 to 4), 218(2 to 8), 234(5 to 12), 265(7 to 12), 266(10 to 9), 287(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 40.000000), (204: 80.000000), (265: 40.000000), (287: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 14), (204: 6), (265: 11), (266: 6), (287: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 305 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
