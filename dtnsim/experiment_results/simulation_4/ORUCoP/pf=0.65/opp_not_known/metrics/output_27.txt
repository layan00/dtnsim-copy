The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1022(1 to 6), 1023(6 to 10), 1024(9 to 4), 1036(2 to 8), 1056(5 to 12), 1085(7 to 12), 1086(10 to 9), 1096(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1024: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1023: 8), (1024: 6), (1085: 7), (1086: 4), (1096: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
