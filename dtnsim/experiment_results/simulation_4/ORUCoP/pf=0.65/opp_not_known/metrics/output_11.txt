The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
636(1 to 6), 637(6 to 10), 638(9 to 4), 656(2 to 8), 671(5 to 12), 698(7 to 12), 699(10 to 9), 711(3 to 8), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(636: 160.000000), (638: 0.000000), (698: 80.000000), (699: 100.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 3), (637: 8), (638: 6), (656: 4), (698: 8), (699: 12), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 178 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
