The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
515(3 to 7), 538(12 to 1), 543(4 to 9), 549(10 to 3), 581(11 to 2), 585(9 to 4), 613(5 to 12), 620(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(515: 5.000000), (538: 35.000000), (543: 95.000000), (581: 25.000000), (620: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(515: 5), (538: 6), (543: 10), (549: 2), (581: 10), (585: 1), (613: 1), (620: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
