The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
524(3 to 7), 540(12 to 1), 547(4 to 9), 555(10 to 3), 593(11 to 2), 600(9 to 4), 623(5 to 12), 630(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(524: 55.000000), (540: 35.000000), (547: 95.000000), (555: 0.000000), (593: 25.000000), (630: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(524: 4), (540: 7), (547: 10), (555: 3), (593: 6), (600: 1), (623: 1), (630: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
