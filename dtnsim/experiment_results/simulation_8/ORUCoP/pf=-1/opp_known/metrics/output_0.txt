The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(3 to 7), 232(12 to 1), 240(4 to 9), 251(10 to 3), 285(11 to 2), 294(9 to 4), 322(5 to 12), 332(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 15.000000), (232: 35.000000), (240: 35.000000), (285: 25.000000), (294: 5.000000), (322: 0.000000), (332: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 6), (232: 7), (240: 9), (251: 4), (285: 6), (294: 6), (322: 5), (332: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 173 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
