The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(3 to 7), 549(12 to 1), 555(4 to 9), 565(10 to 3), 596(11 to 2), 605(9 to 4), 628(5 to 12), 636(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 15.000000), (555: 35.000000), (596: 25.000000), (628: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 5), (549: 5), (555: 9), (565: 2), (596: 6), (605: 2), (628: 3), (636: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
