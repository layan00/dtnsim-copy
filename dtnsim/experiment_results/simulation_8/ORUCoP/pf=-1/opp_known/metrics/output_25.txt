The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(3 to 7), 220(12 to 1), 227(4 to 9), 236(10 to 3), 266(11 to 2), 274(9 to 4), 295(5 to 12), 300(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(198: 15.000000), (227: 35.000000), (266: 25.000000), (300: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 5), (220: 5), (227: 9), (236: 2), (266: 6), (274: 1), (295: 1), (300: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
