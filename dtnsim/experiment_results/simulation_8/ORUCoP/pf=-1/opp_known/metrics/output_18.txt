The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1161(3 to 7), 1183(12 to 1), 1189(4 to 9), 1195(10 to 3), 1234(11 to 2), 1242(9 to 4), 1263(5 to 12), 1270(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1161: 15.000000), (1183: 35.000000), (1189: 35.000000), (1234: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1161: 6), (1183: 7), (1189: 10), (1195: 3), (1234: 6), (1263: 2), (1270: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
