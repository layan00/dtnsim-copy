The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(3 to 7), 232(12 to 1), 240(4 to 9), 251(10 to 3), 289(11 to 2), 299(9 to 4), 324(5 to 12), 332(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 55.000000), (232: 35.000000), (240: 35.000000), (289: 25.000000), (299: 5.000000), (332: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 11), (232: 5), (240: 9), (251: 2), (289: 6), (299: 4), (324: 2), (332: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
