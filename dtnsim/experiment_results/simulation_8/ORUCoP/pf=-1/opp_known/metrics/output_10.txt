The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(3 to 7), 220(12 to 1), 226(4 to 9), 232(10 to 3), 264(11 to 2), 275(9 to 4), 293(5 to 12), 298(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(198: 15.000000), (220: 35.000000), (226: 25.000000), (264: 5.000000), (298: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 6), (220: 7), (226: 6), (264: 5), (275: 1), (298: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
