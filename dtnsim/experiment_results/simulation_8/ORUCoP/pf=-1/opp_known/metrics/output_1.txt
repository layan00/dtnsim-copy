The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
556(3 to 7), 576(12 to 1), 582(4 to 9), 590(10 to 3), 628(11 to 2), 637(9 to 4), 657(5 to 12), 661(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(556: 55.000000), (576: 35.000000), (582: 35.000000), (628: 25.000000), (661: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(556: 11), (576: 4), (582: 9), (590: 2), (628: 6), (661: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
