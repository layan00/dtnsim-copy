The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1193(3 to 7), 1216(12 to 1), 1222(4 to 9), 1230(10 to 3), 1268(11 to 2), 1277(9 to 4), 1296(5 to 12), 1302(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1193: 5.000000), (1216: 35.000000), (1222: 35.000000), (1230: 0.000000), (1268: 25.000000), (1302: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1193: 5), (1216: 6), (1222: 10), (1230: 3), (1268: 6), (1277: 1), (1302: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
