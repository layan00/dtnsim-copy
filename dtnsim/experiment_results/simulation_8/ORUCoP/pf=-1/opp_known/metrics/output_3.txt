The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1192(3 to 7), 1214(12 to 1), 1219(4 to 9), 1227(10 to 3), 1251(11 to 2), 1257(9 to 4), 1277(5 to 12), 1285(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1192: 15.000000), (1214: 35.000000), (1251: 25.000000), (1285: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1192: 6), (1214: 5), (1219: 3), (1227: 2), (1251: 6), (1257: 1), (1277: 1), (1285: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
