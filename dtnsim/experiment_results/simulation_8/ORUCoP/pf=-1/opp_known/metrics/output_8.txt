The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1200(3 to 7), 1221(12 to 1), 1228(4 to 9), 1241(10 to 3), 1277(11 to 2), 1286(9 to 4), 1311(5 to 12), 1317(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1200: 55.000000), (1221: 35.000000), (1228: 35.000000), (1277: 25.000000), (1286: 5.000000), (1317: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1200: 14), (1221: 3), (1228: 9), (1241: 2), (1277: 6), (1286: 4), (1311: 2), (1317: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
