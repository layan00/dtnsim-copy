The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(3 to 7), 248(12 to 1), 256(4 to 9), 276(10 to 3), 324(11 to 2), 342(9 to 4), 379(5 to 12), 399(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 35.000000), (256: 35.000000), (324: 35.000000), (342: 5.000000), (399: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 5), (248: 7), (256: 9), (276: 4), (324: 10), (342: 2), (379: 3), (399: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 181 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
