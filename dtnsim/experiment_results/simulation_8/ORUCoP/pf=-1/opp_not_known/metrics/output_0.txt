The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
234(3 to 7), 268(12 to 1), 275(4 to 9), 297(10 to 3), 344(11 to 2), 363(9 to 4), 404(5 to 12), 425(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 35.000000), (268: 35.000000), (275: 35.000000), (344: 65.000000), (363: 5.000000), (404: 0.000000), (425: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(234: 8), (268: 8), (275: 7), (297: 4), (344: 7), (363: 6), (404: 5), (425: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 195 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
