The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
665(3 to 7), 699(12 to 1), 706(4 to 9), 725(10 to 3), 765(11 to 2), 785(9 to 4), 824(5 to 12), 842(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(665: 35.000000), (706: 35.000000), (765: 65.000000), (785: 5.000000), (842: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(665: 7), (699: 6), (706: 7), (765: 7), (785: 6), (824: 3), (842: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 206 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
