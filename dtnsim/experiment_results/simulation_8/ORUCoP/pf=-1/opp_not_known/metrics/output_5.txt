The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
219(3 to 7), 250(12 to 1), 258(4 to 9), 279(10 to 3), 327(11 to 2), 349(9 to 4), 381(5 to 12), 400(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 35.000000), (279: 15.000000), (327: 35.000000), (349: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(219: 4), (250: 6), (258: 7), (279: 8), (327: 6), (349: 3), (381: 3), (400: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 157 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
