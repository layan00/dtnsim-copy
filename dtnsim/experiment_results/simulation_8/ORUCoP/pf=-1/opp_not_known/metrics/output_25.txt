The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(3 to 7), 256(12 to 1), 266(4 to 9), 285(10 to 3), 329(11 to 2), 349(9 to 4), 384(5 to 12), 402(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(266: 35.000000), (349: 5.000000), (402: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 7), (256: 7), (266: 7), (285: 4), (329: 6), (349: 3), (384: 3), (402: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 169 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
