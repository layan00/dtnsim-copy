The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2028(3 to 7), 2062(12 to 1), 2075(4 to 9), 2094(10 to 3), 2139(11 to 2), 2160(9 to 4), 2198(5 to 12), 2219(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2028: 25.000000), (2062: 35.000000), (2075: 35.000000), (2139: 35.000000), (2160: 0.000000), (2219: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2028: 8), (2062: 8), (2075: 7), (2094: 4), (2139: 9), (2160: 4), (2198: 2), (2219: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
