The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
672(3 to 7), 702(12 to 1), 713(4 to 9), 732(10 to 3), 782(11 to 2), 803(9 to 4), 838(5 to 12), 860(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(672: 25.000000), (702: 35.000000), (713: 95.000000), (732: 0.000000), (782: 35.000000), (803: 5.000000), (860: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(672: 5), (702: 8), (713: 10), (732: 6), (782: 8), (803: 3), (838: 3), (860: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 174 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
