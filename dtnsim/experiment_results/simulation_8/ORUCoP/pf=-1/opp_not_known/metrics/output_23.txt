The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1586(3 to 7), 1617(12 to 1), 1622(4 to 9), 1643(10 to 3), 1684(11 to 2), 1705(9 to 4), 1736(5 to 12), 1756(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1617: 35.000000), (1643: 0.000000), (1684: 5.000000), (1705: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1586: 4), (1617: 3), (1643: 6), (1684: 4), (1705: 3), (1736: 2), (1756: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 176 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
