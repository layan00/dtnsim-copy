The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
677(3 to 7), 711(12 to 1), 717(4 to 9), 736(10 to 3), 786(11 to 2), 807(9 to 4), 842(5 to 12), 864(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(677: 55.000000), (717: 35.000000), (807: 5.000000), (842: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(677: 7), (711: 6), (717: 9), (736: 4), (786: 4), (807: 4), (842: 5), (864: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 216 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
