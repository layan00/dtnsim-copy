The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
662(3 to 7), 696(12 to 1), 702(4 to 9), 719(10 to 3), 768(11 to 2), 786(9 to 4), 821(5 to 12), 841(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(662: 5.000000), (696: 35.000000), (702: 95.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(662: 5), (696: 8), (702: 10), (719: 4), (768: 8), (786: 2), (821: 2), (841: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 173 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
