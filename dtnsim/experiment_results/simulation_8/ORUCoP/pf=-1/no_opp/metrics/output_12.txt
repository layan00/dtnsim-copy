The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
340(3 to 7), 345(12 to 1), 349(4 to 9), 354(10 to 3), 370(11 to 2), 382(9 to 4), 391(5 to 12), 400(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(370: 35.000000), (382: 0.000000), (391: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(340: 2), (349: 6), (354: 3), (370: 5), (382: 3), (391: 3), (400: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
