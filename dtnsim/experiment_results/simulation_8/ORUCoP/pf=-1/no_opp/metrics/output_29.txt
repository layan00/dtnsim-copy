The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
629(3 to 7), 636(12 to 1), 644(4 to 9), 655(10 to 3), 670(11 to 2), 680(9 to 4), 687(5 to 12), 698(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(629: 35.000000), (636: 35.000000), (644: 95.000000), (670: 35.000000), (687: 15.000000), (698: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(629: 4), (636: 8), (644: 4), (655: 2), (670: 7), (680: 1), (687: 3), (698: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
