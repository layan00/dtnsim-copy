The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
445(3 to 7), 453(12 to 1), 459(4 to 9), 465(10 to 3), 483(11 to 2), 491(9 to 4), 502(5 to 12), 511(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(453: 35.000000), (459: 65.000000), (483: 35.000000), (502: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(445: 4), (453: 4), (459: 7), (465: 3), (483: 7), (502: 3), (511: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
