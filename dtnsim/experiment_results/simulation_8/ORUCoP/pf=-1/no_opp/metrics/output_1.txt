The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
232(3 to 7), 238(12 to 1), 243(4 to 9), 249(10 to 3), 262(11 to 2), 271(9 to 4), 278(5 to 12), 284(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 25.000000), (284: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(232: 2), (238: 1), (243: 3), (249: 2), (262: 5), (278: 2), (284: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
