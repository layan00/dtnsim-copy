The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
60(3 to 7), 66(12 to 1), 72(4 to 9), 81(10 to 3), 97(11 to 2), 103(9 to 4), 111(5 to 12), 117(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(66: 35.000000), (97: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(60: 2), (66: 6), (72: 6), (81: 2), (97: 4), (111: 1), (117: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
