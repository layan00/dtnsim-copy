The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
494(3 to 7), 499(12 to 1), 504(4 to 9), 513(10 to 3), 527(11 to 2), 536(9 to 4), 543(5 to 12), 551(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(499: 35.000000), (513: 0.000000), (527: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(494: 2), (499: 3), (513: 3), (527: 7), (536: 1), (551: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
