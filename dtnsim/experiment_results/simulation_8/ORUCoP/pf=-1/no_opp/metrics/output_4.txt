The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
604(3 to 7), 612(12 to 1), 620(4 to 9), 630(10 to 3), 644(11 to 2), 650(9 to 4), 657(5 to 12), 665(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(604: 35.000000), (612: 35.000000), (657: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(604: 5), (612: 6), (620: 6), (630: 2), (644: 1), (657: 3), (665: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
