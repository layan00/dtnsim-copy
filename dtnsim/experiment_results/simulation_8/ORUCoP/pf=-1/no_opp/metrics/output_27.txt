The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
341(3 to 7), 348(12 to 1), 356(4 to 9), 365(10 to 3), 376(11 to 2), 384(9 to 4), 390(5 to 12), 399(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(341: 35.000000), (356: 5.000000), (390: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(341: 4), (348: 1), (356: 5), (365: 3), (376: 1), (390: 3), (399: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
