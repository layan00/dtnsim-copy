The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
584(3 to 7), 592(12 to 1), 597(4 to 9), 604(10 to 3), 618(11 to 2), 627(9 to 4), 638(5 to 12), 645(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(638: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(584: 4), (592: 2), (597: 6), (604: 2), (618: 6), (627: 1), (638: 3), (645: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
