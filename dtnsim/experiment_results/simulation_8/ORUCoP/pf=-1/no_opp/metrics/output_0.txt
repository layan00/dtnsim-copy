The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
78(3 to 7), 86(12 to 1), 92(4 to 9), 103(10 to 3), 117(11 to 2), 126(9 to 4), 142(5 to 12), 153(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(78: 35.000000), (92: 25.000000), (117: 35.000000), (126: 5.000000), (142: 0.000000), (153: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 5), (86: 2), (92: 4), (103: 4), (117: 7), (126: 6), (142: 4), (153: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
