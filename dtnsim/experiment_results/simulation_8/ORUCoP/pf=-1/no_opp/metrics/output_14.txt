The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
626(3 to 7), 631(12 to 1), 637(4 to 9), 645(10 to 3), 660(11 to 2), 665(9 to 4), 674(5 to 12), 683(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(631: 35.000000), (637: 25.000000), (660: 35.000000), (674: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(626: 1), (631: 4), (637: 4), (645: 2), (660: 3), (665: 1), (674: 3), (683: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
