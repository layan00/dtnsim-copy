The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
354(3 to 7), 362(12 to 1), 368(4 to 9), 378(10 to 3), 390(11 to 2), 399(9 to 4), 406(5 to 12), 412(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(354: 35.000000), (378: 0.000000), (412: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(354: 5), (362: 1), (368: 2), (378: 3), (390: 3), (399: 1), (406: 1), (412: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
