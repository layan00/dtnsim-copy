The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
494(3 to 7), 498(12 to 1), 505(4 to 9), 516(10 to 3), 529(11 to 2), 538(9 to 4), 550(5 to 12), 557(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(498: 35.000000), (505: 5.000000), (538: 5.000000), (550: 15.000000), (557: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(494: 1), (498: 3), (505: 5), (516: 2), (529: 5), (538: 4), (550: 3), (557: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
