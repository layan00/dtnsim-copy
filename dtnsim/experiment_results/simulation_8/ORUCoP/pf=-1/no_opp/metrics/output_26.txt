The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(3 to 7), 214(12 to 1), 219(4 to 9), 227(10 to 3), 241(11 to 2), 250(9 to 4), 261(5 to 12), 266(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 3), (214: 3), (219: 4), (227: 2), (241: 5), (250: 2), (266: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
