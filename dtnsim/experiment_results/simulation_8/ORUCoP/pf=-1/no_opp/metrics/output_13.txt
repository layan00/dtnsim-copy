The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
484(3 to 7), 492(12 to 1), 500(4 to 9), 513(10 to 3), 528(11 to 2), 536(9 to 4), 541(5 to 12), 549(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(484: 35.000000), (492: 35.000000), (500: 5.000000), (528: 35.000000), (549: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(484: 5), (492: 4), (500: 4), (513: 2), (528: 7), (549: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
