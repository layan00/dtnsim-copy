The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
357(3 to 7), 363(12 to 1), 368(4 to 9), 376(10 to 3), 390(11 to 2), 399(9 to 4), 410(5 to 12), 417(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(363: 35.000000), (368: 25.000000), (390: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(357: 2), (363: 4), (368: 4), (376: 2), (390: 7), (399: 2), (417: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
