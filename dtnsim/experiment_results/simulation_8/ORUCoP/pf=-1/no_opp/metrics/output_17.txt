The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
311(3 to 7), 319(12 to 1), 324(4 to 9), 331(10 to 3), 347(11 to 2), 354(9 to 4), 364(5 to 12), 372(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(319: 35.000000), (324: 25.000000), (347: 35.000000), (354: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(311: 4), (319: 4), (324: 4), (331: 2), (347: 4), (354: 4), (364: 2), (372: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
