The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
358(3 to 7), 366(12 to 1), 371(4 to 9), 377(10 to 3), 390(11 to 2), 398(9 to 4), 406(5 to 12), 415(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(358: 35.000000), (390: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(358: 5), (366: 1), (371: 4), (390: 7), (398: 1), (406: 2), (415: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
