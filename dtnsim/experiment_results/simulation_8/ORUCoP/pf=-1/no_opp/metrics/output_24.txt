The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
629(3 to 7), 637(12 to 1), 646(4 to 9), 656(10 to 3), 673(11 to 2), 681(9 to 4), 691(5 to 12), 698(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(629: 35.000000), (637: 35.000000), (646: 25.000000), (673: 35.000000), (681: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(629: 5), (637: 8), (646: 4), (656: 2), (673: 4), (681: 3), (691: 1), (698: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
