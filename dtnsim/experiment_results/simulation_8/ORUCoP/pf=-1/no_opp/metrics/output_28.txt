The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(3 to 7), 491(12 to 1), 497(4 to 9), 505(10 to 3), 524(11 to 2), 533(9 to 4), 539(5 to 12), 547(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(481: 5.000000), (491: 35.000000), (505: 0.000000), (524: 35.000000), (547: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 5), (491: 4), (497: 4), (505: 3), (524: 7), (533: 1), (547: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
