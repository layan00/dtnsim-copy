The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
63(3 to 7), 70(12 to 1), 77(4 to 9), 88(10 to 3), 102(11 to 2), 110(9 to 4), 116(5 to 12), 121(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(63: 35.000000), (77: 5.000000), (88: 15.000000), (102: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(63: 4), (70: 3), (77: 4), (88: 4), (102: 3), (110: 1), (121: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
