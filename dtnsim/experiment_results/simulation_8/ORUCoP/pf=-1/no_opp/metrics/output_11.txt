The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
199(3 to 7), 207(12 to 1), 213(4 to 9), 220(10 to 3), 229(11 to 2), 239(9 to 4), 252(5 to 12), 259(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(199: 35.000000), (213: 25.000000), (229: 35.000000), (239: 5.000000), (259: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(199: 5), (207: 1), (213: 4), (229: 8), (239: 4), (252: 1), (259: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
