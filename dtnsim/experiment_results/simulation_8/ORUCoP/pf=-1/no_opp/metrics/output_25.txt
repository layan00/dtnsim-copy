The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(3 to 7), 74(12 to 1), 82(4 to 9), 90(10 to 3), 104(11 to 2), 112(9 to 4), 121(5 to 12), 126(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 25.000000), (126: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 4), (74: 6), (82: 4), (90: 2), (104: 5), (112: 1), (121: 1), (126: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
