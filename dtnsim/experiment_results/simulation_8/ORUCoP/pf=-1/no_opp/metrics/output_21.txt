The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(3 to 7), 229(12 to 1), 234(4 to 9), 240(10 to 3), 257(11 to 2), 266(9 to 4), 273(5 to 12), 278(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 35.000000), (234: 25.000000), (278: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 2), (229: 4), (234: 4), (240: 2), (257: 5), (266: 1), (278: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
