The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
636(3 to 7), 642(12 to 1), 647(4 to 9), 654(10 to 3), 670(11 to 2), 677(9 to 4), 683(5 to 12), 689(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(647: 25.000000), (654: 15.000000), (689: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 2), (642: 3), (647: 4), (654: 4), (670: 2), (677: 1), (689: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
