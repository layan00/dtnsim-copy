The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(3 to 7), 195(12 to 1), 200(4 to 9), 206(10 to 3), 221(11 to 2), 225(9 to 4), 233(5 to 12), 241(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(185: 5.000000), (195: 35.000000), (233: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 5), (195: 4), (200: 6), (206: 2), (225: 1), (233: 3), (241: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
