The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
479(3 to 7), 487(12 to 1), 492(4 to 9), 501(10 to 3), 510(11 to 2), 516(9 to 4), 520(5 to 12), 524(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(479: 35.000000), (524: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(479: 5), (487: 2), (501: 2), (510: 2), (516: 1), (524: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
