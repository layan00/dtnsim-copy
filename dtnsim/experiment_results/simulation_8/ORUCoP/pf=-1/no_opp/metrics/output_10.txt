The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(3 to 7), 74(12 to 1), 80(4 to 9), 87(10 to 3), 102(11 to 2), 113(9 to 4), 119(5 to 12), 125(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(66: 35.000000), (74: 35.000000), (80: 25.000000), (102: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 5), (74: 4), (80: 4), (102: 5), (113: 1), (119: 1), (125: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
