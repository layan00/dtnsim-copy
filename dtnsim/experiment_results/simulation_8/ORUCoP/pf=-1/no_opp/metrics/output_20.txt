The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(3 to 7), 86(12 to 1), 93(4 to 9), 103(10 to 3), 116(11 to 2), 126(9 to 4), 138(5 to 12), 148(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(93: 25.000000), (116: 35.000000), (126: 5.000000), (138: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 2), (86: 2), (93: 4), (103: 2), (116: 7), (126: 4), (138: 3), (148: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
