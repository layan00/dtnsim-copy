The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
338(3 to 7), 343(12 to 1), 346(4 to 9), 351(10 to 3), 362(11 to 2), 368(9 to 4), 377(5 to 12), 383(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(346: 25.000000), (362: 35.000000), (368: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(338: 2), (343: 2), (346: 3), (351: 3), (362: 5), (368: 5), (377: 2), (383: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
