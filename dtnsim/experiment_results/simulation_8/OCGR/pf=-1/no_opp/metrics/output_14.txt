The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
628(3 to 7), 632(12 to 1), 637(4 to 9), 643(10 to 3), 653(11 to 2), 657(9 to 4), 665(5 to 12), 672(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(653: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(628: 2), (632: 2), (637: 4), (643: 3), (653: 4), (657: 2), (665: 2), (672: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
