The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
604(3 to 7), 609(12 to 1), 612(4 to 9), 617(10 to 3), 628(11 to 2), 635(9 to 4), 642(5 to 12), 647(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(612: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(604: 2), (609: 2), (612: 3), (617: 3), (628: 7), (635: 2), (642: 2), (647: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
