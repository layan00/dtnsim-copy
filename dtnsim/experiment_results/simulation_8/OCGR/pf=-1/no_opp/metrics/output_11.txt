The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(3 to 7), 218(12 to 1), 222(4 to 9), 227(10 to 3), 233(11 to 2), 241(9 to 4), 252(5 to 12), 257(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(233: 35.000000), (241: 5.000000), (257: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 2), (218: 2), (222: 4), (227: 1), (233: 7), (241: 5), (252: 2), (257: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
