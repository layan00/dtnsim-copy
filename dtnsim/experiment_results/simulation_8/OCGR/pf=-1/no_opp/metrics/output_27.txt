The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
358(3 to 7), 364(12 to 1), 371(4 to 9), 379(10 to 3), 388(11 to 2), 395(9 to 4), 400(5 to 12), 408(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(358: 35.000000), (371: 5.000000), (400: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(358: 5), (364: 2), (371: 3), (379: 5), (388: 3), (395: 1), (400: 3), (408: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
