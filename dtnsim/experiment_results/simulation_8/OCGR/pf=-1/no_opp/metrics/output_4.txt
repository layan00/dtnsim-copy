The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
615(3 to 7), 620(12 to 1), 627(4 to 9), 634(10 to 3), 643(11 to 2), 648(9 to 4), 652(5 to 12), 658(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(620: 15.000000), (627: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(615: 2), (620: 4), (627: 3), (634: 3), (643: 3), (648: 1), (652: 2), (658: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
