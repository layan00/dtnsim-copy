The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
236(3 to 7), 240(12 to 1), 244(4 to 9), 249(10 to 3), 259(11 to 2), 266(9 to 4), 271(5 to 12), 274(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(274: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 2), (240: 2), (244: 3), (249: 3), (259: 5), (266: 1), (271: 1), (274: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
