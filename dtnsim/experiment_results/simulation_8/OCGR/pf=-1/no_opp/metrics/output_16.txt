The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(3 to 7), 218(12 to 1), 221(4 to 9), 225(10 to 3), 234(11 to 2), 237(9 to 4), 242(5 to 12), 249(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(211: 5.000000), (221: 95.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(211: 2), (218: 2), (221: 5), (225: 3), (234: 2), (237: 2), (242: 2), (249: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
