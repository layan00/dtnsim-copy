The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
507(3 to 7), 510(12 to 1), 514(4 to 9), 522(10 to 3), 535(11 to 2), 542(9 to 4), 547(5 to 12), 554(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(510: 35.000000), (522: 0.000000), (535: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(507: 2), (510: 4), (514: 2), (522: 3), (535: 5), (542: 2), (547: 2), (554: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
