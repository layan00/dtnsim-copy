The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
90(3 to 7), 95(12 to 1), 99(4 to 9), 107(10 to 3), 116(11 to 2), 123(9 to 4), 136(5 to 12), 144(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(99: 65.000000), (116: 35.000000), (123: 5.000000), (136: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(90: 2), (95: 2), (99: 4), (107: 3), (116: 5), (123: 5), (136: 3), (144: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
