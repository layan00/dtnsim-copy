The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
471(3 to 7), 476(12 to 1), 480(4 to 9), 484(10 to 3), 497(11 to 2), 503(9 to 4), 509(5 to 12), 516(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(480: 25.000000), (497: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(471: 2), (476: 2), (480: 3), (484: 5), (497: 5), (503: 1), (509: 3), (516: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
