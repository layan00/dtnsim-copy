The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
645(3 to 7), 650(12 to 1), 658(4 to 9), 664(10 to 3), 674(11 to 2), 681(9 to 4), 690(5 to 12), 696(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 35.000000), (681: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(645: 2), (650: 4), (658: 4), (664: 3), (674: 5), (681: 3), (690: 2), (696: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
