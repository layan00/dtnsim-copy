The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
652(3 to 7), 656(12 to 1), 660(4 to 9), 665(10 to 3), 677(11 to 2), 683(9 to 4), 688(5 to 12), 694(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(665: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(652: 2), (656: 2), (660: 4), (665: 5), (677: 4), (683: 2), (688: 2), (694: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
