The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
91(3 to 7), 95(12 to 1), 101(4 to 9), 109(10 to 3), 119(11 to 2), 127(9 to 4), 138(5 to 12), 146(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(101: 65.000000), (119: 35.000000), (127: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(91: 2), (95: 2), (101: 4), (109: 3), (119: 5), (127: 5), (138: 3), (146: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
