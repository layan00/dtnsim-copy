The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(3 to 7), 89(12 to 1), 95(4 to 9), 101(10 to 3), 111(11 to 2), 117(9 to 4), 124(5 to 12), 128(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 2), (89: 6), (95: 4), (101: 3), (111: 5), (117: 2), (124: 2), (128: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
