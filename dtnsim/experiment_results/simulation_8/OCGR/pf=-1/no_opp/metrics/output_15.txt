The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(3 to 7), 85(12 to 1), 90(4 to 9), 97(10 to 3), 110(11 to 2), 115(9 to 4), 120(5 to 12), 125(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(85: 35.000000), (90: 25.000000), (110: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 2), (85: 6), (90: 3), (97: 3), (110: 5), (115: 1), (120: 2), (125: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
