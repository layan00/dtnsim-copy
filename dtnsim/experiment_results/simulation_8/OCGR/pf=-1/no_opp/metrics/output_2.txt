The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
365(3 to 7), 370(12 to 1), 373(4 to 9), 377(10 to 3), 387(11 to 2), 393(9 to 4), 399(5 to 12), 404(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(373: 25.000000), (387: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(365: 2), (370: 2), (373: 3), (377: 1), (387: 5), (393: 2), (399: 1), (404: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
