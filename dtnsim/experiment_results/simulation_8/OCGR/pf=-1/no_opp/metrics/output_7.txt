The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
369(3 to 7), 374(12 to 1), 378(4 to 9), 386(10 to 3), 397(11 to 2), 404(9 to 4), 410(5 to 12), 415(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(386: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(369: 2), (374: 2), (378: 4), (386: 3), (397: 4), (404: 2), (410: 2), (415: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
