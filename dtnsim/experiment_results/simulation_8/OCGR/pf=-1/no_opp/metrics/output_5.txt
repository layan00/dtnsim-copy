The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
82(3 to 7), 88(12 to 1), 94(4 to 9), 103(10 to 3), 114(11 to 2), 121(9 to 4), 126(5 to 12), 131(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 35.000000), (94: 5.000000), (103: 15.000000), (114: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(82: 5), (88: 2), (94: 3), (103: 5), (114: 4), (121: 2), (126: 2), (131: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
