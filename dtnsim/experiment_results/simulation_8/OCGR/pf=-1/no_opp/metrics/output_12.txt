The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
351(3 to 7), 354(12 to 1), 357(4 to 9), 361(10 to 3), 374(11 to 2), 384(9 to 4), 390(5 to 12), 397(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(357: 25.000000), (374: 35.000000), (384: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(351: 2), (354: 2), (357: 3), (361: 5), (374: 5), (384: 3), (390: 2), (397: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
