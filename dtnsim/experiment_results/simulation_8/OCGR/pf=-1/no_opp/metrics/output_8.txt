The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
508(3 to 7), 511(12 to 1), 517(4 to 9), 527(10 to 3), 538(11 to 2), 545(9 to 4), 555(5 to 12), 560(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(511: 35.000000), (517: 5.000000), (545: 5.000000), (560: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(508: 3), (511: 4), (517: 3), (527: 3), (538: 5), (545: 5), (555: 3), (560: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
