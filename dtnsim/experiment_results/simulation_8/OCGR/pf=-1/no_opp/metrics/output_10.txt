The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(3 to 7), 89(12 to 1), 93(4 to 9), 97(10 to 3), 107(11 to 2), 116(9 to 4), 120(5 to 12), 124(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(93: 25.000000), (107: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 2), (89: 2), (93: 3), (97: 1), (107: 3), (116: 2), (120: 1), (124: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
