The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(3 to 7), 226(12 to 1), 233(4 to 9), 239(10 to 3), 250(11 to 2), 256(9 to 4), 262(5 to 12), 270(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(233: 95.000000), (239: 0.000000), (250: 35.000000), (270: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 2), (226: 4), (233: 5), (239: 3), (250: 4), (256: 2), (262: 2), (270: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
