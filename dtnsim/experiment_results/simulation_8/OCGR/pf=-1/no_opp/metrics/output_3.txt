The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
488(3 to 7), 493(12 to 1), 496(4 to 9), 502(10 to 3), 510(11 to 2), 515(9 to 4), 518(5 to 12), 522(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(522: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(488: 2), (493: 2), (496: 2), (502: 3), (510: 4), (515: 2), (518: 2), (522: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
