The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
640(3 to 7), 646(12 to 1), 653(4 to 9), 662(10 to 3), 673(11 to 2), 681(9 to 4), 686(5 to 12), 692(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(640: 35.000000), (646: 35.000000), (673: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(640: 5), (646: 6), (653: 3), (662: 4), (673: 5), (681: 2), (686: 1), (692: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
