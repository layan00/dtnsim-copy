The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
368(3 to 7), 372(12 to 1), 376(4 to 9), 382(10 to 3), 391(11 to 2), 398(9 to 4), 408(5 to 12), 416(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(376: 65.000000), (391: 35.000000), (408: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(368: 2), (372: 2), (376: 4), (382: 4), (391: 5), (398: 4), (408: 3), (416: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
