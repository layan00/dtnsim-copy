The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
500(3 to 7), 507(12 to 1), 511(4 to 9), 517(10 to 3), 531(11 to 2), 538(9 to 4), 542(5 to 12), 548(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(500: 5.000000), (511: 25.000000), (517: 0.000000), (531: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(500: 2), (507: 2), (511: 3), (517: 3), (531: 5), (538: 2), (542: 1), (548: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
