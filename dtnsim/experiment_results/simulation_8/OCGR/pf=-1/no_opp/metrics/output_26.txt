The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(3 to 7), 225(12 to 1), 229(4 to 9), 235(10 to 3), 245(11 to 2), 252(9 to 4), 262(5 to 12), 269(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 65.000000), (262: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 2), (225: 2), (229: 4), (235: 3), (245: 5), (252: 4), (262: 3), (269: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
