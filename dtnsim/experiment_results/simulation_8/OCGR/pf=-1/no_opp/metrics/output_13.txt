The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
491(3 to 7), 496(12 to 1), 502(4 to 9), 512(10 to 3), 523(11 to 2), 529(9 to 4), 532(5 to 12), 538(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(502: 5.000000), (523: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(491: 2), (496: 2), (502: 3), (512: 3), (523: 5), (529: 1), (532: 1), (538: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
