The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
236(3 to 7), 240(12 to 1), 244(4 to 9), 248(10 to 3), 260(11 to 2), 267(9 to 4), 272(5 to 12), 276(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(244: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 2), (240: 2), (244: 3), (248: 3), (260: 5), (267: 2), (272: 1), (276: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
