The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1135(3 to 7), 1165(12 to 1), 1169(4 to 9), 1187(10 to 3), 1223(11 to 2), 1241(9 to 4), 1275(5 to 12), 1295(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1165: 35.000000), (1169: 65.000000), (1223: 35.000000), (1275: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1135: 5), (1165: 5), (1169: 4), (1187: 4), (1223: 3), (1241: 4), (1275: 3), (1295: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
