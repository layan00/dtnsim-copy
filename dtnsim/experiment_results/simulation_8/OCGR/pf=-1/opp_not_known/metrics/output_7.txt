The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1133(3 to 7), 1164(12 to 1), 1168(4 to 9), 1188(10 to 3), 1226(11 to 2), 1244(9 to 4), 1274(5 to 12), 1293(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1164: 35.000000), (1188: 0.000000), (1226: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1133: 5), (1164: 5), (1168: 4), (1188: 3), (1226: 4), (1244: 2), (1274: 2), (1293: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
