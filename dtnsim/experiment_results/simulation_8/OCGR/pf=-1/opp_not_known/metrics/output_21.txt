The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
696(3 to 7), 726(12 to 1), 730(4 to 9), 746(10 to 3), 785(11 to 2), 803(9 to 4), 832(5 to 12), 850(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(726: 35.000000), (730: 25.000000), (832: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(696: 5), (726: 5), (730: 3), (746: 3), (785: 3), (803: 2), (832: 4), (850: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
