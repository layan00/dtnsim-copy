The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1578(3 to 7), 1605(12 to 1), 1611(4 to 9), 1633(10 to 3), 1668(11 to 2), 1686(9 to 4), 1720(5 to 12), 1737(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1605: 35.000000), (1611: 5.000000), (1686: 5.000000), (1737: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1578: 3), (1605: 4), (1611: 3), (1633: 3), (1668: 3), (1686: 5), (1720: 3), (1737: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
