The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(3 to 7), 277(12 to 1), 283(4 to 9), 303(10 to 3), 340(11 to 2), 359(9 to 4), 394(5 to 12), 414(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(277: 35.000000), (283: 65.000000), (340: 35.000000), (359: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 5), (277: 5), (283: 4), (303: 3), (340: 3), (359: 5), (394: 3), (414: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
