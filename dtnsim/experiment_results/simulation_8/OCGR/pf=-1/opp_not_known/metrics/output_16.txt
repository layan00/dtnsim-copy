The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
674(3 to 7), 705(12 to 1), 708(4 to 9), 724(10 to 3), 760(11 to 2), 775(9 to 4), 809(5 to 12), 828(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 5.000000), (705: 35.000000), (708: 95.000000), (760: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(674: 2), (705: 5), (708: 5), (724: 3), (760: 6), (775: 2), (809: 2), (828: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
