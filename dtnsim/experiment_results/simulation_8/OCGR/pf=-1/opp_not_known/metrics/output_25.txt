The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
240(3 to 7), 271(12 to 1), 278(4 to 9), 296(10 to 3), 330(11 to 2), 347(9 to 4), 378(5 to 12), 394(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(394: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(240: 6), (271: 6), (278: 4), (296: 3), (330: 3), (347: 2), (378: 2), (394: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
