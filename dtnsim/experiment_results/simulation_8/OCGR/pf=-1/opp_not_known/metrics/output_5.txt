The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
238(3 to 7), 270(12 to 1), 275(4 to 9), 295(10 to 3), 332(11 to 2), 351(9 to 4), 380(5 to 12), 397(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 15.000000), (275: 5.000000), (295: 15.000000), (332: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(238: 5), (270: 5), (275: 3), (295: 5), (332: 3), (351: 2), (380: 2), (397: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
