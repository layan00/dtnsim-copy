The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(3 to 7), 277(12 to 1), 281(4 to 9), 301(10 to 3), 337(11 to 2), 355(9 to 4), 392(5 to 12), 412(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(277: 35.000000), (281: 65.000000), (337: 35.000000), (355: 5.000000), (392: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 5), (277: 5), (281: 4), (301: 3), (337: 3), (355: 5), (392: 3), (412: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
