The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
680(3 to 7), 711(12 to 1), 715(4 to 9), 732(10 to 3), 764(11 to 2), 783(9 to 4), 817(5 to 12), 834(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(764: 35.000000), (783: 5.000000), (834: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(680: 5), (711: 5), (715: 4), (732: 1), (764: 3), (783: 5), (817: 2), (834: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
