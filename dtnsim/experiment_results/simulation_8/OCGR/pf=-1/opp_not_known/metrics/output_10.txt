The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
240(3 to 7), 271(12 to 1), 275(4 to 9), 291(10 to 3), 328(11 to 2), 349(9 to 4), 377(5 to 12), 395(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(271: 35.000000), (275: 25.000000), (328: 5.000000), (377: 15.000000), (395: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(240: 5), (271: 5), (275: 3), (291: 1), (328: 3), (349: 2), (377: 4), (395: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
