The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1987(3 to 7), 2018(12 to 1), 2021(4 to 9), 2038(10 to 3), 2076(11 to 2), 2094(9 to 4), 2124(5 to 12), 2141(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2018: 35.000000), (2021: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1987: 5), (2018: 5), (2021: 3), (2038: 3), (2076: 3), (2094: 2), (2124: 2), (2141: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
