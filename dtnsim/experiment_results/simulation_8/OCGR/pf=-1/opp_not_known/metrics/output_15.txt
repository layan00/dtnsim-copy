The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(3 to 7), 267(12 to 1), 273(4 to 9), 292(10 to 3), 329(11 to 2), 344(9 to 4), 377(5 to 12), 393(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(267: 35.000000), (273: 25.000000), (329: 25.000000), (393: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 6), (267: 6), (273: 3), (292: 3), (329: 6), (344: 1), (377: 2), (393: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
