The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1550(3 to 7), 1581(12 to 1), 1585(4 to 9), 1601(10 to 3), 1641(11 to 2), 1658(9 to 4), 1688(5 to 12), 1707(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1581: 35.000000), (1585: 25.000000), (1641: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1550: 5), (1581: 5), (1585: 3), (1601: 5), (1641: 3), (1658: 1), (1688: 3), (1707: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
