The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1566(3 to 7), 1597(12 to 1), 1600(4 to 9), 1618(10 to 3), 1653(11 to 2), 1668(9 to 4), 1697(5 to 12), 1713(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1597: 35.000000), (1713: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1566: 5), (1597: 5), (1600: 2), (1618: 3), (1653: 4), (1668: 2), (1697: 2), (1713: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
