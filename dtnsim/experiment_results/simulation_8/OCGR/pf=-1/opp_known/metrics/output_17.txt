The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
849(3 to 7), 868(12 to 1), 871(4 to 9), 876(10 to 3), 902(11 to 2), 908(9 to 4), 930(5 to 12), 935(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(868: 35.000000), (871: 25.000000), (902: 25.000000), (908: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(849: 5), (868: 5), (871: 3), (876: 3), (902: 5), (908: 5), (930: 2), (935: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
