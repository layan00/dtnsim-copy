The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1506(3 to 7), 1525(12 to 1), 1536(4 to 9), 1542(10 to 3), 1563(11 to 2), 1568(9 to 4), 1586(5 to 12), 1592(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1506: 25.000000), (1525: 5.000000), (1536: 25.000000), (1563: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1506: 6), (1525: 5), (1536: 3), (1542: 3), (1563: 4), (1568: 1), (1586: 2), (1592: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
