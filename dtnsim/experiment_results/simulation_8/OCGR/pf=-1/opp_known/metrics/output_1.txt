The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
555(3 to 7), 573(12 to 1), 577(4 to 9), 582(10 to 3), 611(11 to 2), 618(9 to 4), 636(5 to 12), 641(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(573: 35.000000), (577: 25.000000), (611: 25.000000), (641: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(555: 5), (573: 5), (577: 6), (582: 3), (611: 5), (618: 1), (636: 4), (641: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
