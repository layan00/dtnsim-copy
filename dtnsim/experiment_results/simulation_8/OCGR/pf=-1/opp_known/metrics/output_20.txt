The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(3 to 7), 241(12 to 1), 247(4 to 9), 255(10 to 3), 280(11 to 2), 288(9 to 4), 312(5 to 12), 319(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 35.000000), (247: 65.000000), (280: 25.000000), (288: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 5), (241: 5), (247: 4), (255: 3), (280: 5), (288: 5), (312: 3), (319: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
