The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1189(3 to 7), 1208(12 to 1), 1211(4 to 9), 1217(10 to 3), 1240(11 to 2), 1245(9 to 4), 1262(5 to 12), 1269(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1208: 35.000000), (1240: 25.000000), (1269: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1189: 5), (1208: 5), (1211: 6), (1217: 3), (1240: 5), (1245: 2), (1262: 2), (1269: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
