The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(3 to 7), 234(12 to 1), 239(4 to 9), 247(10 to 3), 272(11 to 2), 279(9 to 4), 297(5 to 12), 301(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 15.000000), (239: 5.000000), (247: 15.000000), (272: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 5), (234: 5), (239: 3), (247: 5), (272: 4), (279: 2), (297: 2), (301: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
