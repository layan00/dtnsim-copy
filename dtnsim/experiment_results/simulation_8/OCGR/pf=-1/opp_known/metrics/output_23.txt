The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1200(3 to 7), 1217(12 to 1), 1221(4 to 9), 1229(10 to 3), 1254(11 to 2), 1261(9 to 4), 1279(5 to 12), 1289(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1217: 35.000000), (1229: 0.000000), (1254: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1200: 5), (1217: 4), (1221: 7), (1229: 3), (1254: 5), (1261: 2), (1279: 2), (1289: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
