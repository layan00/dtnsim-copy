The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(3 to 7), 235(12 to 1), 239(4 to 9), 243(10 to 3), 268(11 to 2), 277(9 to 4), 293(5 to 12), 299(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 35.000000), (239: 25.000000), (268: 5.000000), (293: 15.000000), (299: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 5), (235: 5), (239: 3), (243: 1), (268: 3), (277: 2), (293: 4), (299: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
