The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1198(3 to 7), 1213(12 to 1), 1221(4 to 9), 1231(10 to 3), 1258(11 to 2), 1265(9 to 4), 1288(5 to 12), 1293(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1198: 55.000000), (1213: 35.000000), (1221: 5.000000), (1258: 25.000000), (1265: 5.000000), (1293: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1198: 9), (1213: 4), (1221: 3), (1231: 3), (1258: 5), (1265: 5), (1288: 3), (1293: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
