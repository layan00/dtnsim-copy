The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
869(3 to 7), 888(12 to 1), 892(4 to 9), 900(10 to 3), 930(11 to 2), 937(9 to 4), 956(5 to 12), 961(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(888: 35.000000), (892: 25.000000), (900: 0.000000), (930: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(869: 5), (888: 5), (892: 6), (900: 3), (930: 5), (937: 2), (956: 2), (961: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
