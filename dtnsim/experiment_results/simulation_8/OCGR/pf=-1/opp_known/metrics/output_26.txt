The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
544(3 to 7), 563(12 to 1), 567(4 to 9), 573(10 to 3), 601(11 to 2), 608(9 to 4), 629(5 to 12), 636(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(567: 25.000000), (601: 25.000000), (629: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(544: 5), (563: 5), (567: 6), (573: 3), (601: 5), (608: 4), (629: 3), (636: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
