The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
534(3 to 7), 553(12 to 1), 556(4 to 9), 560(10 to 3), 584(11 to 2), 587(9 to 4), 609(5 to 12), 616(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(534: 5.000000), (553: 35.000000), (556: 95.000000), (584: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(534: 2), (553: 5), (556: 5), (560: 3), (584: 7), (587: 2), (609: 2), (616: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
