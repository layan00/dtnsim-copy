The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(3 to 7), 241(12 to 1), 245(4 to 9), 253(10 to 3), 281(11 to 2), 288(9 to 4), 312(5 to 12), 319(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 35.000000), (245: 25.000000), (281: 25.000000), (288: 5.000000), (312: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 5), (241: 5), (245: 6), (253: 3), (281: 5), (288: 5), (312: 3), (319: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
