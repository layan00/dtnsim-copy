The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
538(3 to 7), 555(12 to 1), 562(4 to 9), 568(10 to 3), 592(11 to 2), 599(9 to 4), 617(5 to 12), 624(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(568: 0.000000), (599: 5.000000), (617: 15.000000), (624: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(538: 4), (555: 3), (562: 3), (568: 3), (592: 2), (599: 2), (617: 3), (624: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
