The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1192(3 to 7), 1211(12 to 1), 1217(4 to 9), 1223(10 to 3), 1249(11 to 2), 1256(9 to 4), 1272(5 to 12), 1279(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1192: 5.000000), (1223: 0.000000), (1256: 5.000000), (1272: 15.000000), (1279: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1192: 2), (1211: 3), (1217: 3), (1223: 3), (1249: 2), (1256: 2), (1272: 3), (1279: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
