The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
868(3 to 7), 887(12 to 1), 893(4 to 9), 901(10 to 3), 927(11 to 2), 934(9 to 4), 951(5 to 12), 957(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(893: 35.000000), (901: 0.000000), (951: 15.000000), (957: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(868: 4), (887: 3), (893: 5), (901: 3), (927: 2), (934: 2), (951: 3), (957: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
