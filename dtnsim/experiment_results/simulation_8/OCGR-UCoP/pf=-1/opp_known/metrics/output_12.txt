The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
856(3 to 7), 873(12 to 1), 876(4 to 9), 880(10 to 3), 905(11 to 2), 914(9 to 4), 930(5 to 12), 937(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(930: 15.000000), (937: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(856: 4), (873: 2), (876: 3), (880: 5), (905: 2), (914: 2), (930: 3), (937: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
