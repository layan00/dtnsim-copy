The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(3 to 7), 546(12 to 1), 551(4 to 9), 555(10 to 3), 577(11 to 2), 582(9 to 4), 599(5 to 12), 606(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 5.000000), (599: 15.000000), (606: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 2), (546: 3), (551: 3), (555: 3), (577: 2), (582: 2), (599: 3), (606: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
