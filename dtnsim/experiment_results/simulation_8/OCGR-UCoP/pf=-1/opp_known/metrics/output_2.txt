The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
871(3 to 7), 890(12 to 1), 895(4 to 9), 899(10 to 3), 921(11 to 2), 927(9 to 4), 945(5 to 12), 951(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(927: 5.000000), (951: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(871: 4), (890: 3), (895: 3), (899: 1), (921: 2), (927: 2), (945: 3), (951: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
