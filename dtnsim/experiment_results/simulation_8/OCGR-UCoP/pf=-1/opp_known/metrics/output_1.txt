The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
551(3 to 7), 569(12 to 1), 575(4 to 9), 580(10 to 3), 605(11 to 2), 612(9 to 4), 630(5 to 12), 635(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(575: 35.000000), (612: 5.000000), (635: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(551: 4), (569: 3), (575: 5), (580: 3), (605: 2), (612: 2), (630: 3), (635: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
