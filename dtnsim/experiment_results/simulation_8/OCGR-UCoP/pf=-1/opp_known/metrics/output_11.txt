The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
535(3 to 7), 554(12 to 1), 560(4 to 9), 565(10 to 3), 586(11 to 2), 594(9 to 4), 612(5 to 12), 617(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(560: 35.000000), (594: 5.000000), (612: 15.000000), (617: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(535: 4), (554: 3), (560: 5), (565: 1), (586: 2), (594: 2), (612: 3), (617: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
