The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
864(3 to 7), 884(12 to 1), 892(4 to 9), 899(10 to 3), 920(11 to 2), 928(9 to 4), 946(5 to 12), 953(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(864: 15.000000), (892: 5.000000), (946: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(864: 5), (884: 3), (892: 3), (899: 5), (920: 2), (928: 2), (946: 3), (953: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
