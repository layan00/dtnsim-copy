The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1506(3 to 7), 1524(12 to 1), 1531(4 to 9), 1537(10 to 3), 1561(11 to 2), 1566(9 to 4), 1583(5 to 12), 1590(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1583: 15.000000), (1590: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1506: 4), (1524: 3), (1531: 6), (1537: 3), (1561: 2), (1566: 1), (1583: 3), (1590: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
