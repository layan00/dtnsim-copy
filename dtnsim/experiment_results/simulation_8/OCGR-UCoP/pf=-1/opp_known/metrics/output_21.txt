The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
550(3 to 7), 568(12 to 1), 574(4 to 9), 578(10 to 3), 602(11 to 2), 609(9 to 4), 626(5 to 12), 632(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(574: 25.000000), (609: 5.000000), (626: 15.000000), (632: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(550: 4), (568: 3), (574: 4), (578: 3), (602: 2), (609: 2), (626: 3), (632: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
