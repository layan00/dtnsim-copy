The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1521(3 to 7), 1540(12 to 1), 1548(4 to 9), 1554(10 to 3), 1579(11 to 2), 1586(9 to 4), 1604(5 to 12), 1610(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1548: 35.000000), (1586: 5.000000), (1604: 15.000000), (1610: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1521: 4), (1540: 3), (1548: 5), (1554: 3), (1579: 2), (1586: 2), (1604: 3), (1610: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
