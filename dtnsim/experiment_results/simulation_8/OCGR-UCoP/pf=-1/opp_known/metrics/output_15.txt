The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(3 to 7), 231(12 to 1), 237(4 to 9), 243(10 to 3), 266(11 to 2), 271(9 to 4), 289(5 to 12), 294(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(271: 5.000000), (294: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 4), (231: 3), (237: 3), (243: 3), (266: 2), (271: 2), (289: 3), (294: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
