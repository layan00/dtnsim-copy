The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(3 to 7), 235(12 to 1), 241(4 to 9), 245(10 to 3), 267(11 to 2), 275(9 to 4), 292(5 to 12), 298(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 25.000000), (275: 5.000000), (292: 15.000000), (298: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 4), (235: 3), (241: 4), (245: 1), (267: 2), (275: 2), (292: 3), (298: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
