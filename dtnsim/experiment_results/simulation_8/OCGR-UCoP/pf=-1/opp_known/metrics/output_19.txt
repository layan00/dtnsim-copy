The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1475(3 to 7), 1494(12 to 1), 1499(4 to 9), 1504(10 to 3), 1527(11 to 2), 1534(9 to 4), 1552(5 to 12), 1558(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1534: 5.000000), (1552: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1475: 4), (1494: 3), (1499: 3), (1504: 3), (1527: 2), (1534: 2), (1552: 3), (1558: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
