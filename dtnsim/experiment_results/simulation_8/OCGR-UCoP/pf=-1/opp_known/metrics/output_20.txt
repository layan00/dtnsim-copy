The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(3 to 7), 241(12 to 1), 249(4 to 9), 257(10 to 3), 279(11 to 2), 287(9 to 4), 306(5 to 12), 313(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(287: 5.000000), (306: 15.000000), (313: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 4), (241: 3), (249: 3), (257: 3), (279: 2), (287: 2), (306: 3), (313: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
