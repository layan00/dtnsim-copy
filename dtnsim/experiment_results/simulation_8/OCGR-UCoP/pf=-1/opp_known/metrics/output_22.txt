The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
871(3 to 7), 889(12 to 1), 895(4 to 9), 901(10 to 3), 926(11 to 2), 933(9 to 4), 952(5 to 12), 958(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(895: 35.000000), (933: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(871: 4), (889: 3), (895: 5), (901: 5), (926: 2), (933: 2), (952: 3), (958: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
