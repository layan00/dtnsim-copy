The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1179(3 to 7), 1198(12 to 1), 1206(4 to 9), 1216(10 to 3), 1239(11 to 2), 1245(9 to 4), 1261(5 to 12), 1268(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1206: 5.000000), (1245: 5.000000), (1261: 15.000000), (1268: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1179: 4), (1198: 3), (1206: 3), (1216: 3), (1239: 2), (1245: 2), (1261: 3), (1268: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
