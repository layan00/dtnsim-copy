The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
540(3 to 7), 559(12 to 1), 565(4 to 9), 571(10 to 3), 596(11 to 2), 603(9 to 4), 622(5 to 12), 628(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(565: 35.000000), (603: 5.000000), (622: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(540: 4), (559: 3), (565: 5), (571: 3), (596: 2), (603: 2), (622: 3), (628: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
