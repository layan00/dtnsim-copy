The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
841(3 to 7), 860(12 to 1), 865(4 to 9), 870(10 to 3), 893(11 to 2), 899(9 to 4), 917(5 to 12), 923(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(865: 25.000000), (899: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(841: 4), (860: 3), (865: 4), (870: 3), (893: 2), (899: 2), (917: 3), (923: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
