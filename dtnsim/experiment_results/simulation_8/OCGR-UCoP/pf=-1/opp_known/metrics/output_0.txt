The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(3 to 7), 241(12 to 1), 247(4 to 9), 255(10 to 3), 279(11 to 2), 286(9 to 4), 306(5 to 12), 312(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 35.000000), (286: 5.000000), (306: 15.000000), (312: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 4), (241: 3), (247: 5), (255: 3), (279: 2), (286: 2), (306: 3), (312: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
