The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1498(3 to 7), 1517(12 to 1), 1524(4 to 9), 1530(10 to 3), 1551(11 to 2), 1557(9 to 4), 1573(5 to 12), 1580(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1573: 15.000000), (1580: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1498: 4), (1517: 3), (1524: 3), (1530: 3), (1551: 2), (1557: 1), (1573: 3), (1580: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
