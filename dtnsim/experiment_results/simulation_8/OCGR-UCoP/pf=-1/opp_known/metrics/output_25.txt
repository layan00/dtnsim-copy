The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(3 to 7), 235(12 to 1), 242(4 to 9), 247(10 to 3), 271(11 to 2), 277(9 to 4), 295(5 to 12), 300(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 35.000000), (277: 5.000000), (295: 15.000000), (300: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 4), (235: 3), (242: 5), (247: 3), (271: 2), (277: 2), (295: 3), (300: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
