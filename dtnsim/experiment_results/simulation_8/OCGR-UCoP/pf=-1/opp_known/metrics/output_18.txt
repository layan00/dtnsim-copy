The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1157(3 to 7), 1176(12 to 1), 1182(4 to 9), 1186(10 to 3), 1211(11 to 2), 1217(9 to 4), 1236(5 to 12), 1242(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1217: 5.000000), (1236: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1157: 4), (1176: 3), (1182: 3), (1186: 5), (1211: 2), (1217: 2), (1236: 3), (1242: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
