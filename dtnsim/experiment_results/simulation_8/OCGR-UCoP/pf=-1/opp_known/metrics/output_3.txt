The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1182(3 to 7), 1201(12 to 1), 1206(4 to 9), 1212(10 to 3), 1232(11 to 2), 1237(9 to 4), 1252(5 to 12), 1260(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1252: 15.000000), (1260: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1182: 4), (1201: 3), (1206: 6), (1212: 3), (1232: 2), (1237: 2), (1252: 3), (1260: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
