The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
643(3 to 7), 646(12 to 1), 650(4 to 9), 656(10 to 3), 670(11 to 2), 674(9 to 4), 680(5 to 12), 688(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(646: 35.000000), (650: 25.000000), (670: 35.000000), (680: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(643: 1), (646: 3), (650: 2), (656: 3), (670: 4), (674: 1), (680: 3), (688: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
