The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
643(3 to 7), 649(12 to 1), 655(4 to 9), 662(10 to 3), 676(11 to 2), 683(9 to 4), 690(5 to 12), 696(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(643: 35.000000), (649: 35.000000), (655: 25.000000), (676: 35.000000), (683: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(643: 4), (649: 3), (655: 2), (662: 3), (676: 5), (683: 2), (690: 2), (696: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
