The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
369(3 to 7), 373(12 to 1), 376(4 to 9), 382(10 to 3), 395(11 to 2), 402(9 to 4), 410(5 to 12), 415(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(373: 35.000000), (376: 25.000000), (395: 35.000000), (402: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(369: 2), (373: 3), (376: 2), (382: 4), (395: 5), (402: 2), (410: 1), (415: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
