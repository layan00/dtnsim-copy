The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(3 to 7), 90(12 to 1), 95(4 to 9), 100(10 to 3), 112(11 to 2), 118(9 to 4), 125(5 to 12), 129(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(95: 25.000000), (118: 5.000000), (129: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 4), (90: 3), (95: 2), (100: 3), (112: 5), (118: 2), (125: 2), (129: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
