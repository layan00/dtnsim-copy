The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
616(3 to 7), 622(12 to 1), 625(4 to 9), 631(10 to 3), 642(11 to 2), 649(9 to 4), 657(5 to 12), 663(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(625: 25.000000), (649: 5.000000), (657: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(616: 4), (622: 2), (625: 2), (631: 3), (642: 7), (649: 2), (657: 3), (663: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
