The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(3 to 7), 229(12 to 1), 232(4 to 9), 238(10 to 3), 251(11 to 2), 258(9 to 4), 266(5 to 12), 270(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(232: 25.000000), (258: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 3), (229: 3), (232: 2), (238: 3), (251: 5), (258: 2), (266: 1), (270: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
