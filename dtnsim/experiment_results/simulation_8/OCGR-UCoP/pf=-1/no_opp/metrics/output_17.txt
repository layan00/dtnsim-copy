The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
339(3 to 7), 345(12 to 1), 348(4 to 9), 354(10 to 3), 367(11 to 2), 373(9 to 4), 380(5 to 12), 387(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(345: 35.000000), (348: 25.000000), (367: 35.000000), (373: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(339: 4), (345: 3), (348: 2), (354: 3), (367: 5), (373: 2), (380: 3), (387: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
