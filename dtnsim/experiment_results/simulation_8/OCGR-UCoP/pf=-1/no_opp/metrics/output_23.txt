The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
506(3 to 7), 509(12 to 1), 513(4 to 9), 521(10 to 3), 534(11 to 2), 541(9 to 4), 547(5 to 12), 553(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(509: 35.000000), (521: 0.000000), (534: 35.000000), (541: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(506: 2), (509: 3), (513: 1), (521: 3), (534: 5), (541: 2), (547: 1), (553: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
