The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
368(3 to 7), 374(12 to 1), 377(4 to 9), 382(10 to 3), 392(11 to 2), 398(9 to 4), 405(5 to 12), 412(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(368: 35.000000), (377: 25.000000), (392: 35.000000), (398: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(368: 4), (374: 1), (377: 2), (382: 1), (392: 5), (398: 2), (405: 3), (412: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
