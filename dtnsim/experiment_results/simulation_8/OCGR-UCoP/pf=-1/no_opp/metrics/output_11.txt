The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(3 to 7), 226(12 to 1), 230(4 to 9), 235(10 to 3), 243(11 to 2), 251(9 to 4), 259(5 to 12), 264(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 35.000000), (230: 25.000000), (243: 35.000000), (251: 5.000000), (264: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 4), (226: 1), (230: 2), (235: 1), (243: 7), (251: 2), (259: 2), (264: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
