The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
358(3 to 7), 361(12 to 1), 364(4 to 9), 368(10 to 3), 381(11 to 2), 391(9 to 4), 395(5 to 12), 403(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(364: 25.000000), (381: 35.000000), (395: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(358: 2), (361: 1), (364: 2), (368: 5), (381: 5), (391: 2), (395: 3), (403: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
