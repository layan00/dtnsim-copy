The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(3 to 7), 225(12 to 1), 229(4 to 9), 236(10 to 3), 249(11 to 2), 255(9 to 4), 262(5 to 12), 271(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 35.000000), (229: 95.000000), (236: 0.000000), (249: 35.000000), (255: 5.000000), (262: 15.000000), (271: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 1), (225: 3), (229: 4), (236: 3), (249: 4), (255: 2), (262: 3), (271: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
