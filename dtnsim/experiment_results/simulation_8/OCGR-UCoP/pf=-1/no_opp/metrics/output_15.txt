The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(3 to 7), 85(12 to 1), 88(4 to 9), 95(10 to 3), 106(11 to 2), 111(9 to 4), 118(5 to 12), 123(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(88: 25.000000), (106: 35.000000), (111: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 2), (85: 2), (88: 2), (95: 3), (106: 5), (111: 2), (118: 2), (123: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
