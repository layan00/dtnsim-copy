The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(3 to 7), 658(12 to 1), 661(4 to 9), 666(10 to 3), 681(11 to 2), 687(9 to 4), 691(5 to 12), 696(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(661: 25.000000), (666: 15.000000), (696: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 2), (658: 3), (661: 2), (666: 5), (681: 4), (687: 2), (691: 1), (696: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
