The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
233(3 to 7), 237(12 to 1), 240(4 to 9), 245(10 to 3), 259(11 to 2), 266(9 to 4), 272(5 to 12), 276(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(237: 35.000000), (240: 25.000000), (266: 5.000000), (276: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(233: 2), (237: 3), (240: 2), (245: 3), (259: 5), (266: 2), (272: 1), (276: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
