The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
625(3 to 7), 631(12 to 1), 636(4 to 9), 644(10 to 3), 653(11 to 2), 658(9 to 4), 662(5 to 12), 669(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(625: 35.000000), (636: 25.000000), (662: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(625: 4), (631: 2), (636: 2), (644: 3), (653: 3), (658: 1), (662: 3), (669: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
