The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
501(3 to 7), 508(12 to 1), 512(4 to 9), 520(10 to 3), 536(11 to 2), 543(9 to 4), 548(5 to 12), 554(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(501: 35.000000), (508: 35.000000), (512: 25.000000), (520: 0.000000), (536: 35.000000), (543: 5.000000), (554: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(501: 4), (508: 3), (512: 2), (520: 3), (536: 5), (543: 2), (548: 1), (554: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
