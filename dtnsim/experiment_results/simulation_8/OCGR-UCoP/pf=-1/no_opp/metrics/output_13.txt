The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
498(3 to 7), 504(12 to 1), 510(4 to 9), 519(10 to 3), 534(11 to 2), 540(9 to 4), 545(5 to 12), 551(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(498: 35.000000), (504: 35.000000), (510: 25.000000), (534: 35.000000), (540: 5.000000), (551: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(498: 4), (504: 3), (510: 2), (519: 3), (534: 5), (540: 2), (545: 1), (551: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
