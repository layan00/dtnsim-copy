The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(3 to 7), 90(12 to 1), 94(4 to 9), 100(10 to 3), 112(11 to 2), 121(9 to 4), 126(5 to 12), 131(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(84: 35.000000), (90: 35.000000), (94: 25.000000), (112: 5.000000), (121: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 4), (90: 3), (94: 2), (100: 1), (112: 3), (121: 2), (126: 2), (131: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
