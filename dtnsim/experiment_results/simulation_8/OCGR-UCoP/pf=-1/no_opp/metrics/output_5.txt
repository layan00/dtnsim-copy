The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
82(3 to 7), 88(12 to 1), 93(4 to 9), 100(10 to 3), 114(11 to 2), 121(9 to 4), 127(5 to 12), 131(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 35.000000), (93: 25.000000), (100: 15.000000), (114: 35.000000), (121: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(82: 4), (88: 3), (93: 2), (100: 5), (114: 4), (121: 2), (127: 1), (131: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
