The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
235(3 to 7), 239(12 to 1), 242(4 to 9), 246(10 to 3), 258(11 to 2), 265(9 to 4), 272(5 to 12), 277(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 25.000000), (265: 5.000000), (277: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(235: 2), (239: 1), (242: 2), (246: 3), (258: 5), (265: 2), (272: 3), (277: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
