The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
511(3 to 7), 514(12 to 1), 520(4 to 9), 527(10 to 3), 539(11 to 2), 546(9 to 4), 554(5 to 12), 560(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(514: 35.000000), (520: 95.000000), (546: 5.000000), (554: 15.000000), (560: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(511: 2), (514: 3), (520: 4), (527: 3), (539: 5), (546: 2), (554: 3), (560: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
