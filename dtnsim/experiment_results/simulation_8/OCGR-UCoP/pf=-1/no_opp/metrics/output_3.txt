The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
496(3 to 7), 502(12 to 1), 505(4 to 9), 513(10 to 3), 521(11 to 2), 526(9 to 4), 529(5 to 12), 532(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 35.000000), (532: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(496: 4), (502: 2), (505: 1), (513: 3), (521: 4), (526: 2), (529: 1), (532: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
