The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(3 to 7), 216(12 to 1), 219(4 to 9), 224(10 to 3), 235(11 to 2), 238(9 to 4), 243(5 to 12), 251(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(216: 35.000000), (219: 95.000000), (243: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 4), (216: 3), (219: 4), (224: 3), (235: 2), (238: 2), (243: 3), (251: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
