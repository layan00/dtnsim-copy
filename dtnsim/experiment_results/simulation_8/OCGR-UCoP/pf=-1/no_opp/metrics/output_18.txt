The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
476(3 to 7), 482(12 to 1), 486(4 to 9), 491(10 to 3), 506(11 to 2), 512(9 to 4), 520(5 to 12), 527(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(482: 35.000000), (486: 25.000000), (506: 35.000000), (512: 5.000000), (520: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(476: 4), (482: 3), (486: 2), (491: 5), (506: 5), (512: 2), (520: 3), (527: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
