The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
371(3 to 7), 377(12 to 1), 381(4 to 9), 389(10 to 3), 400(11 to 2), 407(9 to 4), 412(5 to 12), 417(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(371: 35.000000), (389: 0.000000), (417: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(371: 4), (377: 1), (381: 1), (389: 3), (400: 4), (407: 2), (412: 2), (417: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
