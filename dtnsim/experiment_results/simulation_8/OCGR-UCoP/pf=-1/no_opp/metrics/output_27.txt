The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
359(3 to 7), 365(12 to 1), 371(4 to 9), 376(10 to 3), 386(11 to 2), 393(9 to 4), 399(5 to 12), 407(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(359: 35.000000), (399: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(359: 4), (365: 1), (371: 4), (376: 5), (386: 3), (393: 2), (399: 3), (407: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
