The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
90(3 to 7), 96(12 to 1), 100(4 to 9), 109(10 to 3), 120(11 to 2), 127(9 to 4), 136(5 to 12), 142(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(90: 35.000000), (100: 25.000000), (120: 35.000000), (127: 5.000000), (142: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(90: 4), (96: 2), (100: 2), (109: 3), (120: 5), (127: 2), (136: 2), (142: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 76 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
