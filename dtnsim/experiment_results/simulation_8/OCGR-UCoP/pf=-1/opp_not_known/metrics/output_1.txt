The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
698(3 to 7), 726(12 to 1), 732(4 to 9), 749(10 to 3), 784(11 to 2), 804(9 to 4), 834(5 to 12), 853(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(726: 35.000000), (732: 95.000000), (784: 5.000000), (804: 5.000000), (853: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(698: 2), (726: 4), (732: 6), (749: 3), (784: 3), (804: 2), (834: 3), (853: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
