The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1125(3 to 7), 1152(12 to 1), 1155(4 to 9), 1171(10 to 3), 1208(11 to 2), 1230(9 to 4), 1258(5 to 12), 1278(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1155: 25.000000), (1208: 35.000000), (1258: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1125: 2), (1152: 2), (1155: 2), (1171: 5), (1208: 5), (1230: 2), (1258: 3), (1278: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 133 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
