The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1565(3 to 7), 1597(12 to 1), 1605(4 to 9), 1627(10 to 3), 1663(11 to 2), 1681(9 to 4), 1709(5 to 12), 1728(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1565: 15.000000), (1597: 35.000000), (1605: 5.000000), (1681: 5.000000), (1709: 15.000000), (1728: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1565: 4), (1597: 4), (1605: 3), (1627: 3), (1663: 3), (1681: 2), (1709: 3), (1728: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 84 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
