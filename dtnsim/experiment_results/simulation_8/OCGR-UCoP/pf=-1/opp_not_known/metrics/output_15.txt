The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(3 to 7), 265(12 to 1), 271(4 to 9), 289(10 to 3), 325(11 to 2), 342(9 to 4), 375(5 to 12), 392(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(265: 35.000000), (271: 25.000000), (325: 25.000000), (342: 5.000000), (392: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 2), (265: 4), (271: 2), (289: 3), (325: 7), (342: 2), (375: 3), (392: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 127 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
