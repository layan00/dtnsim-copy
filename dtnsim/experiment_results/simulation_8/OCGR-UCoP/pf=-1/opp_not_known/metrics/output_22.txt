The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1132(3 to 7), 1160(12 to 1), 1166(4 to 9), 1184(10 to 3), 1218(11 to 2), 1237(9 to 4), 1270(5 to 12), 1288(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1160: 35.000000), (1166: 65.000000), (1237: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1132: 2), (1160: 4), (1166: 4), (1184: 4), (1218: 5), (1237: 2), (1270: 3), (1288: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 25 calls to RUCoP, which took 168 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
