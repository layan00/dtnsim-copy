The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2013(3 to 7), 2040(12 to 1), 2047(4 to 9), 2065(10 to 3), 2100(11 to 2), 2117(9 to 4), 2149(5 to 12), 2169(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2040: 35.000000), (2100: 35.000000), (2149: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2013: 1), (2040: 4), (2047: 4), (2065: 3), (2100: 5), (2117: 1), (2149: 3), (2169: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
