The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
240(3 to 7), 272(12 to 1), 278(4 to 9), 294(10 to 3), 329(11 to 2), 350(9 to 4), 379(5 to 12), 397(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(240: 15.000000), (272: 35.000000), (278: 25.000000), (329: 5.000000), (350: 5.000000), (379: 15.000000), (397: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(240: 4), (272: 4), (278: 2), (294: 1), (329: 3), (350: 2), (379: 3), (397: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 71 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
