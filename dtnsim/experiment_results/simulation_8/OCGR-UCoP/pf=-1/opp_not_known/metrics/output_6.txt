The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
682(3 to 7), 708(12 to 1), 715(4 to 9), 733(10 to 3), 769(11 to 2), 788(9 to 4), 821(5 to 12), 841(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(708: 35.000000), (715: 95.000000), (733: 0.000000), (769: 25.000000), (788: 5.000000), (821: 15.000000), (841: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(682: 1), (708: 4), (715: 5), (733: 3), (769: 5), (788: 2), (821: 3), (841: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
