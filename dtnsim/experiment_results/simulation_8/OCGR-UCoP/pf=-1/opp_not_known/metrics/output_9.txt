The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2029(3 to 7), 2057(12 to 1), 2063(4 to 9), 2080(10 to 3), 2116(11 to 2), 2135(9 to 4), 2164(5 to 12), 2183(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2080: 15.000000), (2116: 5.000000), (2164: 15.000000), (2183: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2029: 2), (2057: 4), (2063: 4), (2080: 5), (2116: 3), (2135: 2), (2164: 3), (2183: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 134 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
