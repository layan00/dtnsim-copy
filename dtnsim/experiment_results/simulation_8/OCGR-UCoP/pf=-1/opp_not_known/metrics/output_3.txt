The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1573(3 to 7), 1605(12 to 1), 1610(4 to 9), 1628(10 to 3), 1661(11 to 2), 1678(9 to 4), 1705(5 to 12), 1722(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1573: 15.000000), (1605: 35.000000), (1705: 15.000000), (1722: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1573: 4), (1605: 4), (1610: 1), (1628: 3), (1661: 5), (1678: 2), (1705: 3), (1722: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 108 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
