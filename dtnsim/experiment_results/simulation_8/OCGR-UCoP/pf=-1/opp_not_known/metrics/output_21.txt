The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
692(3 to 7), 720(12 to 1), 726(4 to 9), 742(10 to 3), 779(11 to 2), 799(9 to 4), 828(5 to 12), 846(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(720: 35.000000), (726: 25.000000), (779: 5.000000), (799: 5.000000), (828: 15.000000), (846: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(692: 2), (720: 4), (726: 2), (742: 3), (779: 3), (799: 2), (828: 3), (846: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 93 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
