The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(3 to 7), 275(12 to 1), 283(4 to 9), 303(10 to 3), 338(11 to 2), 359(9 to 4), 391(5 to 12), 410(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(275: 35.000000), (283: 65.000000), (338: 5.000000), (359: 5.000000), (391: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 2), (275: 4), (283: 4), (303: 3), (338: 3), (359: 2), (391: 3), (410: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 104 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
