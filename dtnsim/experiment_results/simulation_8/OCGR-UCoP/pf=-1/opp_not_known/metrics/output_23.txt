The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1571(3 to 7), 1598(12 to 1), 1602(4 to 9), 1622(10 to 3), 1659(11 to 2), 1679(9 to 4), 1708(5 to 12), 1727(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1598: 35.000000), (1622: 0.000000), (1659: 5.000000), (1679: 5.000000), (1708: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1571: 2), (1598: 4), (1602: 1), (1622: 3), (1659: 3), (1679: 2), (1708: 3), (1727: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 86 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
