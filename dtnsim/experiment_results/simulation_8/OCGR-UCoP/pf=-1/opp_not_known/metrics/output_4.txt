The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2008(3 to 7), 2040(12 to 1), 2047(4 to 9), 2065(10 to 3), 2099(11 to 2), 2118(9 to 4), 2146(5 to 12), 2166(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2008: 15.000000), (2040: 35.000000), (2047: 25.000000), (2099: 35.000000), (2146: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2008: 4), (2040: 4), (2047: 3), (2065: 3), (2099: 5), (2118: 1), (2146: 3), (2166: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 100 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
