The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
238(3 to 7), 270(12 to 1), 277(4 to 9), 297(10 to 3), 332(11 to 2), 352(9 to 4), 381(5 to 12), 398(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 15.000000), (277: 5.000000), (297: 15.000000), (352: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(238: 4), (270: 4), (277: 3), (297: 5), (332: 3), (352: 2), (381: 3), (398: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
