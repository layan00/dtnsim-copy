The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
686(3 to 7), 718(12 to 1), 724(4 to 9), 742(10 to 3), 776(11 to 2), 795(9 to 4), 828(5 to 12), 846(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(686: 15.000000), (724: 65.000000), (795: 5.000000), (828: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(686: 4), (718: 4), (724: 4), (742: 3), (776: 3), (795: 2), (828: 3), (846: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 111 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
