The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
240(3 to 7), 272(12 to 1), 279(4 to 9), 296(10 to 3), 329(11 to 2), 347(9 to 4), 381(5 to 12), 398(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(240: 15.000000), (329: 25.000000), (347: 5.000000), (381: 15.000000), (398: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(240: 4), (272: 4), (279: 4), (296: 3), (329: 5), (347: 2), (381: 3), (398: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 123 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
