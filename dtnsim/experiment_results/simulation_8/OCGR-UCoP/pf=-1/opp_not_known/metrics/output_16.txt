The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
673(3 to 7), 706(12 to 1), 711(4 to 9), 727(10 to 3), 761(11 to 2), 778(9 to 4), 810(5 to 12), 830(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(673: 15.000000), (706: 35.000000), (711: 95.000000), (761: 25.000000), (810: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(673: 4), (706: 4), (711: 4), (727: 3), (761: 7), (778: 2), (810: 3), (830: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
