The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1584(3 to 7), 1611(12 to 1), 1617(4 to 9), 1639(10 to 3), 1674(11 to 2), 1693(9 to 4), 1727(5 to 12), 1744(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1611: 35.000000), (1617: 5.000000), (1674: 25.000000), (1693: 5.000000), (1727: 15.000000), (1744: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1584: 2), (1611: 4), (1617: 3), (1639: 3), (1674: 7), (1693: 2), (1727: 3), (1744: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 91 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
