The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1579(3 to 7), 1612(12 to 1), 1618(4 to 9), 1636(10 to 3), 1675(11 to 2), 1694(9 to 4), 1722(5 to 12), 1741(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1579: 15.000000), (1612: 35.000000), (1618: 25.000000), (1636: 0.000000), (1694: 5.000000), (1722: 15.000000), (1741: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1579: 4), (1612: 4), (1618: 2), (1636: 3), (1675: 3), (1694: 2), (1722: 3), (1741: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 86 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
