The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(3 to 7), 278(12 to 1), 284(4 to 9), 304(10 to 3), 338(11 to 2), 357(9 to 4), 394(5 to 12), 412(10 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 15.000000), (278: 35.000000), (284: 65.000000), (338: 25.000000), (357: 5.000000), (394: 15.000000), (412: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 4), (278: 4), (284: 4), (304: 3), (338: 7), (357: 2), (394: 3), (412: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 90 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
