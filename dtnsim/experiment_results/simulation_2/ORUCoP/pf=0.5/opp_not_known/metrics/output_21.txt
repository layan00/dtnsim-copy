The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
621(1 to 12), 637(6 to 3), 668(8 to 2), 679(4 to 5), 699(2 to 4), 700(9 to 10), 701(12 to 11), 708(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(637: 35.000000), (668: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(621: 3), (637: 4), (668: 6), (679: 2), (699: 2), (700: 6), (708: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 223 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
