The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1428(1 to 12), 1444(6 to 3), 1474(8 to 2), 1484(4 to 5), 1501(2 to 4), 1502(9 to 10), 1503(12 to 11), 1509(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1428: 25.000000), (1502: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1428: 3), (1444: 4), (1474: 4), (1502: 8), (1509: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 149 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
