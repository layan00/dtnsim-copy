The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1836(1 to 12), 1853(6 to 3), 1882(8 to 2), 1892(4 to 5), 1913(2 to 4), 1914(9 to 10), 1915(12 to 11), 1930(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1836: 25.000000), (1853: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1836: 3), (1853: 5), (1882: 4), (1913: 4), (1914: 6), (1915: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 203 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
