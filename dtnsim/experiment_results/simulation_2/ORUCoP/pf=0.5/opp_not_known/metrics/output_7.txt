The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1007(1 to 12), 1022(6 to 3), 1050(8 to 2), 1058(4 to 5), 1076(2 to 4), 1077(9 to 10), 1078(12 to 11), 1084(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1007: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1007: 4), (1022: 6), (1050: 4), (1077: 3), (1084: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 168 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
