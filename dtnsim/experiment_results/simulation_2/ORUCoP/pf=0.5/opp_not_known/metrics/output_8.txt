The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1404(1 to 12), 1421(6 to 3), 1451(8 to 2), 1461(4 to 5), 1478(2 to 4), 1479(9 to 10), 1480(12 to 11), 1491(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1404: 25.000000), (1421: 35.000000), (1451: 60.000000), (1479: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1404: 3), (1421: 6), (1451: 6), (1479: 8), (1480: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 172 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
