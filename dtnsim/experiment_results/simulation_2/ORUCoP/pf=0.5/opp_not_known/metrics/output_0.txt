The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
199(1 to 12), 215(6 to 3), 246(8 to 2), 255(4 to 5), 276(2 to 4), 277(9 to 10), 278(12 to 11), 291(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 35.000000), (277: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(199: 3), (215: 4), (246: 4), (276: 6), (277: 8), (278: 4), (291: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 217 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
