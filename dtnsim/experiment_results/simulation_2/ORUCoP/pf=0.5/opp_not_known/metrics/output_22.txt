The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1021(1 to 12), 1036(6 to 3), 1067(8 to 2), 1077(4 to 5), 1099(2 to 4), 1100(9 to 10), 1101(12 to 11), 1115(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1036: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1021: 4), (1036: 7), (1067: 4), (1077: 1), (1099: 2), (1100: 4), (1101: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 62 calls to RUCoP, which took 293 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
