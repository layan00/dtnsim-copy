The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
992(1 to 12), 1008(6 to 3), 1039(8 to 2), 1049(4 to 5), 1068(2 to 4), 1069(9 to 10), 1070(12 to 11), 1077(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1008: 35.000000), (1039: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(992: 4), (1008: 4), (1039: 6), (1049: 2), (1069: 5), (1070: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 227 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
