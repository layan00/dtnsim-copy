The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1800(1 to 12), 1817(6 to 3), 1845(8 to 2), 1853(4 to 5), 1871(2 to 4), 1872(9 to 10), 1873(12 to 11), 1880(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1817: 35.000000), (1880: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1817: 5), (1845: 4), (1872: 3), (1880: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 163 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
