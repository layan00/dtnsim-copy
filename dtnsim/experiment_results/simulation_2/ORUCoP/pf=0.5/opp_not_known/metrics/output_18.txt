The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1409(1 to 12), 1426(6 to 3), 1453(8 to 2), 1462(4 to 5), 1480(2 to 4), 1481(9 to 10), 1482(12 to 11), 1487(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1409: 65.000000), (1426: 35.000000), (1481: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1409: 3), (1426: 4), (1453: 4), (1481: 10), (1487: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 145 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
