The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1014(1 to 12), 1028(6 to 3), 1056(8 to 2), 1066(4 to 5), 1086(2 to 4), 1087(9 to 10), 1088(12 to 11), 1098(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1014: 65.000000), (1056: 60.000000), (1088: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1014: 4), (1028: 4), (1056: 6), (1087: 4), (1088: 6), (1098: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 179 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
