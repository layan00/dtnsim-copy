The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 12), 223(6 to 3), 256(8 to 2), 266(4 to 5), 286(2 to 4), 287(9 to 10), 288(12 to 11), 305(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 25.000000), (223: 35.000000), (256: 60.000000), (287: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 3), (223: 9), (256: 6), (286: 2), (287: 8), (288: 6), (305: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 229 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
