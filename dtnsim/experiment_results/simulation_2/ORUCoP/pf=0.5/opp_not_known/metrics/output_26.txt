The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
584(1 to 12), 598(6 to 3), 628(8 to 2), 638(4 to 5), 657(2 to 4), 658(9 to 10), 659(12 to 11), 666(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(584: 65.000000), (598: 35.000000), (628: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(584: 3), (598: 4), (628: 6), (658: 6), (659: 8), (666: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 175 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
