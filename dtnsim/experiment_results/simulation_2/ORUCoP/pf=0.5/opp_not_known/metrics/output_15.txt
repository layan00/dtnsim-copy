The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
193(1 to 12), 210(6 to 3), 240(8 to 2), 248(4 to 5), 265(2 to 4), 266(9 to 10), 267(12 to 11), 279(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(240: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(193: 1), (210: 4), (240: 6), (265: 6), (266: 4), (267: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 195 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
