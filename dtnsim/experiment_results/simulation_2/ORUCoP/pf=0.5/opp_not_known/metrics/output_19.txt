The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1806(1 to 12), 1820(6 to 3), 1848(8 to 2), 1856(4 to 5), 1878(2 to 4), 1879(9 to 10), 1880(12 to 11), 1897(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1820: 35.000000), (1878: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1806: 4), (1820: 4), (1848: 4), (1856: 4), (1878: 10), (1879: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 178 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
