The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
593(1 to 12), 608(6 to 3), 637(8 to 2), 646(4 to 5), 666(2 to 4), 667(9 to 10), 668(12 to 11), 678(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(637: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(593: 2), (608: 4), (637: 6), (646: 4), (666: 4), (667: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 243 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
