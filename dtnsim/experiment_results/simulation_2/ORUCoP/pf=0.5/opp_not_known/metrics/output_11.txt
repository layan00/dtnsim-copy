The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
614(1 to 12), 630(6 to 3), 660(8 to 2), 668(4 to 5), 687(2 to 4), 688(9 to 10), 689(12 to 11), 704(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(660: 60.000000), (668: 5.000000), (689: 20.000000), (704: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(630: 4), (660: 6), (668: 7), (688: 5), (689: 6), (704: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 162 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
