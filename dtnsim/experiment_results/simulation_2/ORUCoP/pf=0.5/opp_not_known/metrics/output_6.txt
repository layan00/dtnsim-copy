The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
590(1 to 12), 606(6 to 3), 637(8 to 2), 648(4 to 5), 669(2 to 4), 670(9 to 10), 671(12 to 11), 683(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(590: 25.000000), (637: 60.000000), (648: 25.000000), (671: 20.000000), (683: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(590: 4), (606: 4), (637: 6), (648: 5), (669: 4), (670: 6), (671: 6), (683: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 234 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
