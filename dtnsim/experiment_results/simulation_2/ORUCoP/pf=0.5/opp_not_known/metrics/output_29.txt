The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1805(1 to 12), 1821(6 to 3), 1851(8 to 2), 1860(4 to 5), 1880(2 to 4), 1881(9 to 10), 1882(12 to 11), 1889(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1821: 35.000000), (1851: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1805: 4), (1821: 4), (1851: 6), (1860: 1), (1881: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 225 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
