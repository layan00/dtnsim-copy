The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1031(1 to 12), 1046(6 to 3), 1074(8 to 2), 1082(4 to 5), 1102(2 to 4), 1103(9 to 10), 1104(12 to 11), 1114(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1103: 20.000000), (1104: 20.000000), (1114: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1046: 4), (1074: 4), (1103: 8), (1104: 6), (1114: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 180 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
