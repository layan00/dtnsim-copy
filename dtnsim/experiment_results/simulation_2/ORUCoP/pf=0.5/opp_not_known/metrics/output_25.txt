The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
184(1 to 12), 200(6 to 3), 228(8 to 2), 236(4 to 5), 254(2 to 4), 255(9 to 10), 256(12 to 11), 262(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(200: 35.000000), (228: 60.000000), (256: 20.000000), (262: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(184: 1), (200: 4), (228: 6), (255: 6), (256: 4), (262: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 136 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
