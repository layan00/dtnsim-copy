The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
992(1 to 12), 1006(6 to 3), 1033(8 to 2), 1041(4 to 5), 1061(2 to 4), 1062(9 to 10), 1063(12 to 11), 1070(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1006: 35.000000), (1062: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(992: 4), (1006: 4), (1033: 4), (1062: 10), (1063: 10), (1070: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 179 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
