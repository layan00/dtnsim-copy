The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
139(1 to 12), 143(6 to 3), 150(8 to 2), 155(4 to 5), 164(2 to 4), 165(9 to 10), 166(12 to 11), 180(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(139: 25.000000), (180: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(139: 4), (143: 2), (150: 2), (155: 3), (164: 2), (166: 2), (180: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
