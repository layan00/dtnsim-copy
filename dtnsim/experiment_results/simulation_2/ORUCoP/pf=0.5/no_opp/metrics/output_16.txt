The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
132(1 to 12), 135(6 to 3), 140(8 to 2), 143(4 to 5), 150(2 to 4), 151(9 to 10), 152(12 to 11), 161(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(132: 1), (135: 2), (143: 1), (150: 2), (151: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 132: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 150: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 143: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 135: (to: 10, time: 60.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 150: (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 151: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), 
Node 10:
