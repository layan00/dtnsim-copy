The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(1 to 12), 220(6 to 3), 227(8 to 2), 231(4 to 5), 237(2 to 4), 238(9 to 10), 239(12 to 11), 245(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 2), (220: 2), (231: 1), (239: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 216: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 231: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 220: (to: 10, time: 25.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 239: (to: 9, time: 60.000000), 
Node 13: 
Node 14: 
Node 15:
