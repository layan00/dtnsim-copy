The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
384(1 to 12), 390(6 to 3), 398(8 to 2), 402(4 to 5), 410(2 to 4), 411(9 to 10), 412(12 to 11), 437(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(384: 45.000000), (437: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(384: 4), (390: 8), (398: 4), (402: 3), (410: 5), (412: 2), (437: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
