The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
55(1 to 12), 59(6 to 3), 66(8 to 2), 69(4 to 5), 78(2 to 4), 79(9 to 10), 80(12 to 11), 95(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(79: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(55: 2), (66: 6), (78: 2), (79: 8), (80: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 86 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
