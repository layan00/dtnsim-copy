The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
236(1 to 12), 239(6 to 3), 243(8 to 2), 245(4 to 5), 251(2 to 4), 252(9 to 10), 253(12 to 11), 260(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 3), (239: 1), (243: 1), (252: 1), (260: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 236: (to: 5, time: 80.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2:
