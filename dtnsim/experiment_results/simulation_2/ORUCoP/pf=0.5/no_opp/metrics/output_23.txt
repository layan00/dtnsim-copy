The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
360(1 to 12), 364(6 to 3), 370(8 to 2), 374(4 to 5), 379(2 to 4), 380(9 to 10), 381(12 to 11), 387(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(360: 25.000000), (380: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(360: 3), (370: 1), (380: 4), (387: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 360: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 380: (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 380: (to: 10, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5:

Bundle 387: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 370: (to: 12, time: 60.000000),
