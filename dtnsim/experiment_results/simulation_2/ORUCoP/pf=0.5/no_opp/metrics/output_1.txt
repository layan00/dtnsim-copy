The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
154(1 to 12), 156(6 to 3), 162(8 to 2), 166(4 to 5), 171(2 to 4), 172(9 to 10), 173(12 to 11), 178(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(178: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(154: 2), (166: 1), (173: 1), (178: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 154: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 154: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 166: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 178: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6:
