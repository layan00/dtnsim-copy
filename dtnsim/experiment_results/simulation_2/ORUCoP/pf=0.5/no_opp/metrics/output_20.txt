The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
62(1 to 12), 67(6 to 3), 76(8 to 2), 80(4 to 5), 88(2 to 4), 89(9 to 10), 90(12 to 11), 111(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(62: 25.000000), (76: 60.000000), (89: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(62: 3), (67: 5), (76: 14), (88: 1), (89: 8), (90: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
