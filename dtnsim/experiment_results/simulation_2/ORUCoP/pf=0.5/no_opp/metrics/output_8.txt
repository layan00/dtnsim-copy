The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
324(1 to 12), 329(6 to 3), 335(8 to 2), 339(4 to 5), 344(2 to 4), 345(9 to 10), 346(12 to 11), 354(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(324: 25.000000), (345: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(324: 3), (329: 1), (345: 8), (346: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
