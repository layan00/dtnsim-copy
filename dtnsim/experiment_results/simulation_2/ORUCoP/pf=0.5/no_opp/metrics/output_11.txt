The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
159(1 to 12), 163(6 to 3), 169(8 to 2), 171(4 to 5), 177(2 to 4), 178(9 to 10), 179(12 to 11), 195(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(171: 5.000000), (179: 20.000000), (195: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(169: 4), (171: 4), (178: 5), (179: 6), (195: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
