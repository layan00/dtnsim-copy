The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
43(1 to 12), 46(6 to 3), 51(8 to 2), 53(4 to 5), 60(2 to 4), 61(9 to 10), 62(12 to 11), 72(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(61: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(46: 3), (51: 2), (61: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 61: (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 61: (to: 10, time: 120.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 61: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 46: (to: 10, time: 60.000000),
