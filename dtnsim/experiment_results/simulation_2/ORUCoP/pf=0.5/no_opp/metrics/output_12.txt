The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
267(1 to 12), 270(6 to 3), 274(8 to 2), 276(4 to 5), 284(2 to 4), 285(9 to 10), 286(12 to 11), 300(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(285: 20.000000), (286: 20.000000), (300: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(270: 1), (274: 6), (285: 8), (286: 6), (300: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
