The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
457(1 to 12), 462(6 to 3), 467(8 to 2), 471(4 to 5), 480(2 to 4), 481(9 to 10), 482(12 to 11), 493(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(457: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(457: 3), (462: 2), (480: 2), (481: 6), (482: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
