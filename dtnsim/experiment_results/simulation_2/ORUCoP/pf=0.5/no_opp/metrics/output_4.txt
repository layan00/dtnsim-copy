The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
416(1 to 12), 419(6 to 3), 425(8 to 2), 428(4 to 5), 434(2 to 4), 435(9 to 10), 436(12 to 11), 448(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(435: 60.000000), (436: 20.000000), (448: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(416: 2), (419: 2), (434: 2), (435: 8), (436: 3), (448: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
