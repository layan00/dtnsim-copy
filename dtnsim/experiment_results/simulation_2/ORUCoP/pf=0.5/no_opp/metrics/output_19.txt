The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
396(1 to 12), 398(6 to 3), 402(8 to 2), 404(4 to 5), 413(2 to 4), 414(9 to 10), 415(12 to 11), 433(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(413: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(396: 2), (398: 6), (402: 2), (404: 2), (413: 5), (414: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
