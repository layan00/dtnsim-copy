The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(1 to 12), 239(6 to 3), 243(8 to 2), 247(4 to 5), 255(2 to 4), 256(9 to 10), 257(12 to 11), 270(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(237: 65.000000), (257: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 4), (243: 3), (256: 4), (257: 6), (270: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
