The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
306(1 to 12), 311(6 to 3), 315(8 to 2), 318(4 to 5), 324(2 to 4), 325(9 to 10), 326(12 to 11), 334(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(306: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(306: 3), (315: 1), (318: 2), (325: 1), (334: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 306: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), 
Node 2:
