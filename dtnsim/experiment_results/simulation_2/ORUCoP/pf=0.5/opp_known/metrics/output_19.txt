The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1297(1 to 12), 1299(6 to 3), 1315(8 to 2), 1320(4 to 5), 1330(2 to 4), 1331(9 to 10), 1332(12 to 11), 1343(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1299: 35.000000), (1330: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1297: 2), (1299: 4), (1315: 4), (1320: 2), (1330: 5), (1331: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
