The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
751(1 to 12), 753(6 to 3), 769(8 to 2), 776(4 to 5), 784(2 to 4), 785(9 to 10), 786(12 to 11), 794(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(751: 65.000000), (769: 60.000000), (786: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(751: 4), (753: 4), (769: 6), (785: 4), (786: 3), (794: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
