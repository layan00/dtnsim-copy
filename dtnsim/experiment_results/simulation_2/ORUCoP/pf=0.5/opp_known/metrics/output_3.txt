The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1026(1 to 12), 1030(6 to 3), 1048(8 to 2), 1053(4 to 5), 1056(2 to 4), 1057(9 to 10), 1058(12 to 11), 1063(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1030: 35.000000), (1057: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1026: 1), (1030: 4), (1048: 4), (1057: 11), (1063: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
