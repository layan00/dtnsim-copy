The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
768(1 to 12), 771(6 to 3), 787(8 to 2), 792(4 to 5), 800(2 to 4), 801(9 to 10), 802(12 to 11), 810(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(801: 20.000000), (802: 20.000000), (810: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(771: 4), (787: 4), (801: 8), (802: 3), (810: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
