The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
187(1 to 12), 191(6 to 3), 210(8 to 2), 217(4 to 5), 226(2 to 4), 227(9 to 10), 228(12 to 11), 239(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(191: 35.000000), (227: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(187: 2), (191: 4), (210: 4), (226: 2), (227: 8), (228: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 121 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
