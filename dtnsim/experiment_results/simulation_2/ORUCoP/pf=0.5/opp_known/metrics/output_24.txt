The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1341(1 to 12), 1346(6 to 3), 1363(8 to 2), 1373(4 to 5), 1382(2 to 4), 1383(9 to 10), 1384(12 to 11), 1395(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1341: 25.000000), (1346: 35.000000), (1383: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1341: 3), (1346: 6), (1363: 4), (1382: 2), (1383: 9), (1384: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
