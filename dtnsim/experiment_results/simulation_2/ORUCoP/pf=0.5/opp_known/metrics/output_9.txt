The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1308(1 to 12), 1313(6 to 3), 1329(8 to 2), 1337(4 to 5), 1343(2 to 4), 1344(9 to 10), 1345(12 to 11), 1351(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1313: 35.000000), (1351: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1313: 6), (1329: 4), (1344: 4), (1351: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
