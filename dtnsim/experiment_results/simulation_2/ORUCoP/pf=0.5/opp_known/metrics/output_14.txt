The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1376(1 to 12), 1381(6 to 3), 1399(8 to 2), 1406(4 to 5), 1412(2 to 4), 1413(9 to 10), 1414(12 to 11), 1418(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1376: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1376: 3), (1381: 4), (1399: 4), (1413: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
