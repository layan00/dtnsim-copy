The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
183(1 to 12), 187(6 to 3), 204(8 to 2), 211(4 to 5), 220(2 to 4), 221(9 to 10), 222(12 to 11), 231(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(183: 25.000000), (204: 60.000000), (222: 20.000000), (231: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(183: 3), (187: 4), (204: 6), (220: 1), (221: 4), (222: 3), (231: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
