The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1033(1 to 12), 1038(6 to 3), 1056(8 to 2), 1066(4 to 5), 1071(2 to 4), 1072(9 to 10), 1073(12 to 11), 1082(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1033: 25.000000), (1038: 35.000000), (1056: 60.000000), (1072: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1033: 3), (1038: 6), (1056: 6), (1072: 8), (1073: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
