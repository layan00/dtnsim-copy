The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
466(1 to 12), 468(6 to 3), 486(8 to 2), 494(4 to 5), 499(2 to 4), 500(9 to 10), 501(12 to 11), 507(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(468: 35.000000), (500: 60.000000), (501: 20.000000), (507: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(466: 2), (468: 4), (486: 4), (494: 1), (500: 11), (501: 4), (507: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
