The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1052(1 to 12), 1056(6 to 3), 1074(8 to 2), 1081(4 to 5), 1086(2 to 4), 1087(9 to 10), 1088(12 to 11), 1093(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1052: 25.000000), (1087: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1052: 3), (1056: 4), (1074: 4), (1087: 9), (1093: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
