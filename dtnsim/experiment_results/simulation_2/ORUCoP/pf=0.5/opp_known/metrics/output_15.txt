The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
181(1 to 12), 186(6 to 3), 204(8 to 2), 209(4 to 5), 214(2 to 4), 215(9 to 10), 216(12 to 11), 225(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(204: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(181: 1), (186: 4), (204: 6), (214: 1), (215: 4), (216: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
