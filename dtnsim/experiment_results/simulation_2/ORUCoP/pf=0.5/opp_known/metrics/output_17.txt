The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
728(1 to 12), 730(6 to 3), 745(8 to 2), 750(4 to 5), 758(2 to 4), 759(9 to 10), 760(12 to 11), 766(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(730: 35.000000), (759: 60.000000), (760: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(728: 2), (730: 4), (745: 4), (759: 10), (760: 4), (766: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
