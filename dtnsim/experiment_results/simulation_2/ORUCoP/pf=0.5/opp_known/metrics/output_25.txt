The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(1 to 12), 176(6 to 3), 192(8 to 2), 197(4 to 5), 203(2 to 4), 204(9 to 10), 205(12 to 11), 211(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(176: 35.000000), (192: 60.000000), (205: 20.000000), (211: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 1), (176: 4), (192: 6), (204: 6), (205: 4), (211: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
