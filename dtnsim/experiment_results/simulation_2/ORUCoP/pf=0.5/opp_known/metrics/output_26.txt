The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
453(1 to 12), 455(6 to 3), 473(8 to 2), 480(4 to 5), 487(2 to 4), 488(9 to 10), 489(12 to 11), 495(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(453: 65.000000), (455: 35.000000), (473: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(453: 3), (455: 4), (473: 6), (488: 6), (489: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
