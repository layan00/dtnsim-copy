The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
175(1 to 12), 178(6 to 3), 195(8 to 2), 200(4 to 5), 207(2 to 4), 208(9 to 10), 209(12 to 11), 214(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(208: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(178: 4), (195: 4), (208: 10), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
