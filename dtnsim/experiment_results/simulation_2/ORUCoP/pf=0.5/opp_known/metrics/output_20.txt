The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(1 to 12), 199(6 to 3), 220(8 to 2), 230(4 to 5), 238(2 to 4), 239(9 to 10), 240(12 to 11), 255(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(194: 25.000000), (199: 35.000000), (220: 60.000000), (239: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 3), (199: 9), (220: 6), (238: 1), (239: 8), (240: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
