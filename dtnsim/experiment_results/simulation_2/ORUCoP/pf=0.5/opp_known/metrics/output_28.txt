The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1024(1 to 12), 1029(6 to 3), 1045(8 to 2), 1052(4 to 5), 1058(2 to 4), 1059(9 to 10), 1060(12 to 11), 1067(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1024: 45.000000), (1059: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1024: 3), (1029: 4), (1045: 4), (1052: 2), (1059: 6), (1067: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
