The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1018(1 to 12), 1023(6 to 3), 1038(8 to 2), 1044(4 to 5), 1050(2 to 4), 1051(9 to 10), 1052(12 to 11), 1057(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1018: 65.000000), (1023: 35.000000), (1051: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1018: 3), (1023: 4), (1038: 4), (1051: 11), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
