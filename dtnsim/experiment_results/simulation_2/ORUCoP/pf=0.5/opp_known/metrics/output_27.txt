The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
738(1 to 12), 742(6 to 3), 761(8 to 2), 771(4 to 5), 777(2 to 4), 778(9 to 10), 779(12 to 11), 785(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(742: 35.000000), (761: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(738: 2), (742: 6), (761: 6), (771: 1), (778: 4), (779: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
