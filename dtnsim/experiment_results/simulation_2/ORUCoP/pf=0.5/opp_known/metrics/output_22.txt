The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
768(1 to 12), 771(6 to 3), 790(8 to 2), 800(4 to 5), 810(2 to 4), 811(9 to 10), 812(12 to 11), 822(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(771: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(768: 3), (771: 6), (790: 4), (800: 1), (810: 1), (811: 4), (812: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
