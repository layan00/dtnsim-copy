The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1313(1 to 12), 1316(6 to 3), 1334(8 to 2), 1340(4 to 5), 1346(2 to 4), 1347(9 to 10), 1348(12 to 11), 1358(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1347: 60.000000), (1348: 20.000000), (1358: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1313: 2), (1316: 4), (1334: 4), (1346: 2), (1347: 9), (1348: 3), (1358: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
