The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
474(1 to 12), 478(6 to 3), 496(8 to 2), 501(4 to 5), 508(2 to 4), 509(9 to 10), 510(12 to 11), 523(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 60.000000), (501: 5.000000), (510: 20.000000), (523: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(478: 4), (496: 6), (501: 4), (509: 5), (510: 6), (523: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
