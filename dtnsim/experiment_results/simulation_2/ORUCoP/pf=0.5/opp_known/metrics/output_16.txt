The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
454(1 to 12), 457(6 to 3), 474(8 to 2), 480(4 to 5), 488(2 to 4), 489(9 to 10), 490(12 to 11), 497(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(474: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(454: 1), (457: 4), (474: 6), (480: 1), (488: 2), (489: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
