The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 12), 206(6 to 3), 209(8 to 2), 211(4 to 5), 218(2 to 4), 219(9 to 10), 220(12 to 11), 235(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 2), (206: 2), (209: 6), (219: 6), (220: 5), (235: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
