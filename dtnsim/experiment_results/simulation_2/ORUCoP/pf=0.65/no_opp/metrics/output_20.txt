The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
51(1 to 12), 54(6 to 3), 63(8 to 2), 68(4 to 5), 74(2 to 4), 75(9 to 10), 76(12 to 11), 89(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(51: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(51: 3), (54: 1), (63: 3), (75: 2), (76: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 51: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000),
