The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
110(1 to 12), 112(6 to 3), 116(8 to 2), 118(4 to 5), 125(2 to 4), 126(9 to 10), 127(12 to 11), 136(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(112: 2), (118: 1), (125: 2), (126: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 125: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 118: (to: 8, time: 55.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 112: (to: 10, time: 60.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 125: (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7:
