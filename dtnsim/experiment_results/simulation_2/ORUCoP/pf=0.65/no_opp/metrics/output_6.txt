The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
108(1 to 12), 112(6 to 3), 117(8 to 2), 120(4 to 5), 126(2 to 4), 127(9 to 10), 128(12 to 11), 134(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(108: 65.000000), (134: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(108: 3), (117: 1), (126: 1), (134: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 108: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 126: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 108: (to: 12, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 134: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 117: (to: 12, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Bundle 134: (to: 3, time: 80.000000),
