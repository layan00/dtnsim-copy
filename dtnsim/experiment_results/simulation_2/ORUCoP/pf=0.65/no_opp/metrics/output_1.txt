The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
120(1 to 12), 122(6 to 3), 127(8 to 2), 130(4 to 5), 133(2 to 4), 134(9 to 10), 135(12 to 11), 140(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(140: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(120: 1), (135: 1), (140: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 120: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 140: (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 140: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Bundle 140: (to: 3, time: 80.000000), 
Node 12: 
Bundle 135: (to: 9, time: 60.000000), 
Node 13: 
Node 14: 
Node 15:
