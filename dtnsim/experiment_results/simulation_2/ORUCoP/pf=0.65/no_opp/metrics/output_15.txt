The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
41(1 to 12), 45(6 to 3), 50(8 to 2), 52(4 to 5), 57(2 to 4), 58(9 to 10), 59(12 to 11), 68(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(41: 1), (57: 1), (58: 4), (59: 2), (68: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 41: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 57: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3:
