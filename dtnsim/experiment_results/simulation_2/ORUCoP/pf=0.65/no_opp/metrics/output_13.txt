The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
303(1 to 12), 309(6 to 3), 316(8 to 2), 320(4 to 5), 327(2 to 4), 328(9 to 10), 329(12 to 11), 346(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(303: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(303: 4), (309: 4), (316: 4), (320: 3), (327: 1), (329: 2), (346: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
