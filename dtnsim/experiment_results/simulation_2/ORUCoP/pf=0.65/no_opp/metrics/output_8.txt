The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
252(1 to 12), 256(6 to 3), 259(8 to 2), 262(4 to 5), 267(2 to 4), 268(9 to 10), 269(12 to 11), 277(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(268: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(252: 2), (268: 8), (269: 2), (277: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
