The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
309(1 to 12), 311(6 to 3), 313(8 to 2), 315(4 to 5), 322(2 to 4), 323(9 to 10), 324(12 to 11), 341(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(309: 3), (311: 6), (313: 2), (322: 4), (323: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
