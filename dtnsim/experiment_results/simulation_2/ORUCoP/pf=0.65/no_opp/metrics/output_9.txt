The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
323(1 to 12), 328(6 to 3), 332(8 to 2), 334(4 to 5), 339(2 to 4), 340(9 to 10), 341(12 to 11), 346(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(328: 1), (340: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 328: (to: 10, time: 25.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 340: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11:
