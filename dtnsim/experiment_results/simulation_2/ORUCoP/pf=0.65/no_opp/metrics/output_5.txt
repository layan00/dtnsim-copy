The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
33(1 to 12), 36(6 to 3), 41(8 to 2), 43(4 to 5), 47(2 to 4), 48(9 to 10), 49(12 to 11), 56(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(48: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(33: 1), (36: 2), (48: 4), (56: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
