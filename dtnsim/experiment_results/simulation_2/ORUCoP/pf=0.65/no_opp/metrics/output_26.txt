The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
88(1 to 12), 90(6 to 3), 96(8 to 2), 100(4 to 5), 105(2 to 4), 106(9 to 10), 107(12 to 11), 112(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(88: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(88: 3), (107: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 88: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 88: (to: 12, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 107: (to: 9, time: 60.000000), 
Node 13: 
Node 14: 
Node 15:
