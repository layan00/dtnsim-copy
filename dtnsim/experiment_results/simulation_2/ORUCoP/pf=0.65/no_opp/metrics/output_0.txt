The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
36(1 to 12), 39(6 to 3), 42(8 to 2), 44(4 to 5), 52(2 to 4), 53(9 to 10), 54(12 to 11), 67(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(53: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(36: 3), (42: 6), (53: 6), (54: 5), (67: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 84 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
