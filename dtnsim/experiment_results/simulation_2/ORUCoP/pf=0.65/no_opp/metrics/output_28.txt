The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
243(1 to 12), 247(6 to 3), 251(8 to 2), 254(4 to 5), 260(2 to 4), 261(9 to 10), 262(12 to 11), 270(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(243: 3), (251: 1), (254: 2), (261: 1), (270: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 243: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), 
Node 2:
