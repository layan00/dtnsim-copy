The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 12), 218(6 to 3), 225(8 to 2), 229(4 to 5), 239(2 to 4), 240(9 to 10), 241(12 to 11), 251(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 2), (218: 2), (229: 1), (239: 1), (240: 4), (241: 2), (251: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 215: (to: 4, time: 40.000000),
