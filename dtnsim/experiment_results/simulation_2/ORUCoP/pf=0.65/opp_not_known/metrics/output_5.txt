The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
177(1 to 12), 192(6 to 3), 221(8 to 2), 227(4 to 5), 243(2 to 4), 244(9 to 10), 245(12 to 11), 251(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(244: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(177: 1), (192: 4), (221: 6), (244: 8), (251: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 187 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
