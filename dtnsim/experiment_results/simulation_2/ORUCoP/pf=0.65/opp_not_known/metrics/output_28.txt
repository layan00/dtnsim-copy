The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1342(1 to 12), 1358(6 to 3), 1386(8 to 2), 1395(4 to 5), 1414(2 to 4), 1415(9 to 10), 1416(12 to 11), 1427(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1342: 45.000000), (1415: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1342: 3), (1358: 6), (1386: 7), (1395: 4), (1415: 5), (1427: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 147 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
