The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
542(1 to 12), 556(6 to 3), 586(8 to 2), 594(4 to 5), 611(2 to 4), 612(9 to 10), 613(12 to 11), 620(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(542: 65.000000), (556: 35.000000), (586: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(542: 3), (556: 4), (586: 6), (612: 6), (613: 8), (620: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 185 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
