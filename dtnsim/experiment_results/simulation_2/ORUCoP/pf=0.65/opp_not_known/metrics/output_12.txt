The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
981(1 to 12), 996(6 to 3), 1023(8 to 2), 1029(4 to 5), 1048(2 to 4), 1049(9 to 10), 1050(12 to 11), 1060(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1049: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(981: 3), (996: 4), (1023: 4), (1049: 6), (1050: 5), (1060: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 231 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
