The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
948(1 to 12), 962(6 to 3), 989(8 to 2), 995(4 to 5), 1012(2 to 4), 1013(9 to 10), 1014(12 to 11), 1018(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(948: 65.000000), (989: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(948: 3), (962: 4), (989: 6), (1013: 6), (1018: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 172 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
