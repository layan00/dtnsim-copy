The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(1 to 12), 201(6 to 3), 230(8 to 2), 236(4 to 5), 253(2 to 4), 254(9 to 10), 255(12 to 11), 267(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(230: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 1), (201: 6), (230: 6), (253: 6), (254: 4), (255: 5), (267: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 216 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
