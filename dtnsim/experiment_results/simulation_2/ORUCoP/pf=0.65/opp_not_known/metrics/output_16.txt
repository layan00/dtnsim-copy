The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
572(1 to 12), 586(6 to 3), 614(8 to 2), 620(4 to 5), 642(2 to 4), 643(9 to 10), 644(12 to 11), 654(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(614: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(586: 4), (614: 6), (620: 2), (642: 6), (643: 4), (654: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 229 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
