The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
947(1 to 12), 962(6 to 3), 990(8 to 2), 996(4 to 5), 1013(2 to 4), 1014(9 to 10), 1015(12 to 11), 1021(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(947: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(947: 3), (962: 6), (990: 4), (1014: 3), (1021: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 179 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
