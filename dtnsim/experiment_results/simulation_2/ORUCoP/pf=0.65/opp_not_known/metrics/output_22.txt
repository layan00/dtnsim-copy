The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
990(1 to 12), 1005(6 to 3), 1037(8 to 2), 1049(4 to 5), 1074(2 to 4), 1075(9 to 10), 1076(12 to 11), 1089(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(990: 2), (1005: 6), (1037: 6), (1049: 4), (1074: 2), (1075: 4), (1076: 5), (1089: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 84 calls to RUCoP, which took 349 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
