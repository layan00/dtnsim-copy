The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1327(1 to 12), 1343(6 to 3), 1370(8 to 2), 1377(4 to 5), 1394(2 to 4), 1395(9 to 10), 1396(12 to 11), 1407(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1343: 35.000000), (1370: 60.000000), (1395: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1327: 3), (1343: 4), (1370: 6), (1395: 8), (1396: 5), (1407: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 197 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
