The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1390(1 to 12), 1404(6 to 3), 1433(8 to 2), 1441(4 to 5), 1458(2 to 4), 1459(9 to 10), 1460(12 to 11), 1466(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1390: 2), (1404: 4), (1433: 6), (1459: 2), (1466: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 195 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
