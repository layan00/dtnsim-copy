The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
942(1 to 12), 958(6 to 3), 990(8 to 2), 1002(4 to 5), 1021(2 to 4), 1022(9 to 10), 1023(12 to 11), 1029(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(990: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(942: 3), (958: 8), (990: 6), (1002: 4), (1022: 5), (1023: 6), (1029: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 226 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
