The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1712(1 to 12), 1726(6 to 3), 1752(8 to 2), 1758(4 to 5), 1777(2 to 4), 1778(9 to 10), 1779(12 to 11), 1793(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1712: 3), (1726: 4), (1752: 3), (1777: 8), (1778: 4), (1793: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 70 calls to RUCoP, which took 256 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
