The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1339(1 to 12), 1354(6 to 3), 1381(8 to 2), 1388(4 to 5), 1406(2 to 4), 1407(9 to 10), 1408(12 to 11), 1413(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1354: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1339: 3), (1354: 4), (1381: 4), (1407: 6), (1413: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 174 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
