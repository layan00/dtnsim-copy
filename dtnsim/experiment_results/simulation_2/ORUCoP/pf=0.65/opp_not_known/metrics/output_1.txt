The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
563(1 to 12), 577(6 to 3), 606(8 to 2), 613(4 to 5), 628(2 to 4), 629(9 to 10), 630(12 to 11), 636(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(629: 60.000000), (630: 20.000000), (636: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(563: 1), (577: 4), (606: 4), (629: 10), (630: 8), (636: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 174 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
