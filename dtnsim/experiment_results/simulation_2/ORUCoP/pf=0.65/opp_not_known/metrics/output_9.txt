The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1710(1 to 12), 1727(6 to 3), 1756(8 to 2), 1766(4 to 5), 1783(2 to 4), 1784(9 to 10), 1785(12 to 11), 1791(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1727: 6), (1756: 4), (1784: 4), (1791: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 191 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
