The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1321(1 to 12), 1336(6 to 3), 1365(8 to 2), 1371(4 to 5), 1385(2 to 4), 1386(9 to 10), 1387(12 to 11), 1391(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1321: 1), (1336: 6), (1365: 4), (1386: 5), (1391: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 183 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
