The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(1 to 12), 201(6 to 3), 229(8 to 2), 235(4 to 5), 254(2 to 4), 255(9 to 10), 256(12 to 11), 262(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 1), (201: 4), (229: 4), (255: 4), (262: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 201 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
