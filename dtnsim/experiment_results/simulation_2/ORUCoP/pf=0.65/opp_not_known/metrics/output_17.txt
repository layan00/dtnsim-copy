The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
951(1 to 12), 965(6 to 3), 992(8 to 2), 998(4 to 5), 1014(2 to 4), 1015(9 to 10), 1016(12 to 11), 1022(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1016: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(951: 2), (965: 6), (992: 4), (1015: 6), (1016: 8), (1022: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
