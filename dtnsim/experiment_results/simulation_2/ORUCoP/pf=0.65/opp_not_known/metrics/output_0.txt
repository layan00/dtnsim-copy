The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(1 to 12), 195(6 to 3), 222(8 to 2), 228(4 to 5), 248(2 to 4), 249(9 to 10), 250(12 to 11), 261(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(195: 35.000000), (249: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(180: 3), (195: 4), (222: 3), (249: 6), (250: 5), (261: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 62 calls to RUCoP, which took 252 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
