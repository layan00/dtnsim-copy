The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1799(1 to 12), 1815(6 to 3), 1845(8 to 2), 1854(4 to 5), 1870(2 to 4), 1871(9 to 10), 1872(12 to 11), 1876(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1799: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1799: 3), (1815: 4), (1845: 4), (1871: 5), (1876: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 206 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
