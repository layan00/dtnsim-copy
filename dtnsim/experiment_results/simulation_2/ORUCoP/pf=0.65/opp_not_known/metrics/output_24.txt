The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1773(1 to 12), 1789(6 to 3), 1818(8 to 2), 1829(4 to 5), 1847(2 to 4), 1848(9 to 10), 1849(12 to 11), 1859(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1773: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1773: 3), (1789: 8), (1818: 4), (1848: 6), (1849: 5), (1859: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 184 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
