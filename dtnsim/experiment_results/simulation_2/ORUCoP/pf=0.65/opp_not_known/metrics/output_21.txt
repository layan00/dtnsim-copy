The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
600(1 to 12), 615(6 to 3), 645(8 to 2), 653(4 to 5), 672(2 to 4), 673(9 to 10), 674(12 to 11), 681(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(615: 35.000000), (645: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(600: 2), (615: 4), (645: 4), (672: 2), (673: 6), (681: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 192 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
