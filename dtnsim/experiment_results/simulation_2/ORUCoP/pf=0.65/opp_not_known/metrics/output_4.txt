The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1698(1 to 12), 1713(6 to 3), 1743(8 to 2), 1750(4 to 5), 1766(2 to 4), 1767(9 to 10), 1768(12 to 11), 1774(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1698: 3), (1713: 6), (1743: 4), (1767: 5), (1768: 8), (1774: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 228 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
