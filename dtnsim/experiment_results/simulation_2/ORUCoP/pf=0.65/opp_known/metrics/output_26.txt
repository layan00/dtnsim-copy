The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
409(1 to 12), 411(6 to 3), 429(8 to 2), 437(4 to 5), 442(2 to 4), 443(9 to 10), 444(12 to 11), 450(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(409: 65.000000), (411: 35.000000), (429: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(409: 3), (411: 4), (429: 6), (443: 6), (444: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
