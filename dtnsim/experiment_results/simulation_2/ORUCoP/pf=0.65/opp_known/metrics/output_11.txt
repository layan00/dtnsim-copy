The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
445(1 to 12), 449(6 to 3), 467(8 to 2), 473(4 to 5), 480(2 to 4), 481(9 to 10), 482(12 to 11), 490(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(467: 60.000000), (473: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(449: 4), (467: 6), (473: 5), (481: 6), (482: 8), (490: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
