The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1289(1 to 12), 1293(6 to 3), 1311(8 to 2), 1320(4 to 5), 1324(2 to 4), 1325(9 to 10), 1326(12 to 11), 1330(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1289: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1289: 3), (1293: 4), (1311: 4), (1325: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1289: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000),
