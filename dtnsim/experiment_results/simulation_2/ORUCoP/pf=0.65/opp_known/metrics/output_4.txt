The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1207(1 to 12), 1210(6 to 3), 1228(8 to 2), 1235(4 to 5), 1239(2 to 4), 1240(9 to 10), 1241(12 to 11), 1246(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1207: 2), (1210: 4), (1228: 4), (1240: 4), (1241: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
