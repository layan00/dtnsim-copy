The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
952(1 to 12), 955(6 to 3), 972(8 to 2), 978(4 to 5), 980(2 to 4), 981(9 to 10), 982(12 to 11), 986(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(952: 1), (955: 4), (972: 4), (981: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
