The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1271(1 to 12), 1275(6 to 3), 1291(8 to 2), 1302(4 to 5), 1308(2 to 4), 1309(9 to 10), 1310(12 to 11), 1317(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1271: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1271: 3), (1275: 5), (1291: 4), (1309: 6), (1310: 3), (1317: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
