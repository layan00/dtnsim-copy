The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
958(1 to 12), 962(6 to 3), 978(8 to 2), 987(4 to 5), 993(2 to 4), 994(9 to 10), 995(12 to 11), 1002(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(958: 45.000000), (994: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(958: 3), (962: 4), (978: 4), (987: 2), (994: 6), (1002: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
