The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
434(1 to 12), 436(6 to 3), 453(8 to 2), 460(4 to 5), 463(2 to 4), 464(9 to 10), 465(12 to 11), 470(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(464: 60.000000), (465: 20.000000), (470: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(434: 1), (436: 4), (453: 4), (464: 11), (465: 4), (470: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
