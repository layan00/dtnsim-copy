The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1231(1 to 12), 1235(6 to 3), 1252(8 to 2), 1261(4 to 5), 1268(2 to 4), 1269(9 to 10), 1270(12 to 11), 1275(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1235: 35.000000), (1252: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1231: 3), (1235: 4), (1252: 6), (1261: 1), (1269: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
