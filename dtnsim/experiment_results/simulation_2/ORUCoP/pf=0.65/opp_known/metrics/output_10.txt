The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(1 to 12), 177(6 to 3), 193(8 to 2), 199(4 to 5), 206(2 to 4), 207(9 to 10), 208(12 to 11), 213(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(193: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 1), (177: 4), (193: 6), (207: 5), (213: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
