The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
698(1 to 12), 701(6 to 3), 717(8 to 2), 723(4 to 5), 728(2 to 4), 729(9 to 10), 730(12 to 11), 735(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(698: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(698: 3), (701: 4), (717: 4), (729: 4), (735: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
