The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
432(1 to 12), 436(6 to 3), 453(8 to 2), 460(4 to 5), 466(2 to 4), 467(9 to 10), 468(12 to 11), 473(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(432: 65.000000), (473: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(432: 3), (436: 4), (453: 4), (466: 1), (467: 6), (473: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
