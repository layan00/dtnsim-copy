The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
959(1 to 12), 963(6 to 3), 978(8 to 2), 985(4 to 5), 990(2 to 4), 991(9 to 10), 992(12 to 11), 1000(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(963: 35.000000), (978: 60.000000), (991: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(959: 2), (963: 4), (978: 6), (991: 9), (992: 3), (1000: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
