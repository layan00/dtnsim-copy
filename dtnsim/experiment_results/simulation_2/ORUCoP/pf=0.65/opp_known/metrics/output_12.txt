The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
729(1 to 12), 732(6 to 3), 747(8 to 2), 753(4 to 5), 760(2 to 4), 761(9 to 10), 762(12 to 11), 769(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(761: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(729: 2), (732: 4), (747: 4), (761: 6), (762: 3), (769: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
