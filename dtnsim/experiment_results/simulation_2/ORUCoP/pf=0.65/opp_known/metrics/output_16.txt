The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
433(1 to 12), 435(6 to 3), 451(8 to 2), 457(4 to 5), 466(2 to 4), 467(9 to 10), 468(12 to 11), 475(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(451: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(435: 4), (451: 6), (457: 1), (466: 2), (467: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
