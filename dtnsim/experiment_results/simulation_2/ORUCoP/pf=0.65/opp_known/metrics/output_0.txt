The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
168(1 to 12), 171(6 to 3), 186(8 to 2), 192(4 to 5), 200(2 to 4), 201(9 to 10), 202(12 to 11), 212(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(171: 35.000000), (201: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(168: 3), (171: 4), (186: 4), (201: 6), (202: 5), (212: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 117 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
