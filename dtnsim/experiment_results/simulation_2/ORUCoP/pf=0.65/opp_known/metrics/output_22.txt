The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
735(1 to 12), 738(6 to 3), 757(8 to 2), 769(4 to 5), 779(2 to 4), 780(9 to 10), 781(12 to 11), 790(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(738: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(735: 2), (738: 6), (757: 4), (769: 1), (779: 1), (780: 4), (781: 3), (790: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
