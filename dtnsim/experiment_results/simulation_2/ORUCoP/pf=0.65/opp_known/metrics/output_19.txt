The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1206(1 to 12), 1208(6 to 3), 1222(8 to 2), 1228(4 to 5), 1235(2 to 4), 1236(9 to 10), 1237(12 to 11), 1246(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1206: 3), (1208: 4), (1222: 4), (1235: 4), (1236: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
