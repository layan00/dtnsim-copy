The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
688(1 to 12), 690(6 to 3), 705(8 to 2), 711(4 to 5), 715(2 to 4), 716(9 to 10), 717(12 to 11), 722(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(717: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(688: 2), (690: 4), (705: 4), (716: 6), (717: 4), (722: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
