The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
183(1 to 12), 186(6 to 3), 207(8 to 2), 220(4 to 5), 226(2 to 4), 227(9 to 10), 228(12 to 11), 241(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(183: 25.000000), (186: 35.000000), (207: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(183: 3), (186: 9), (207: 6), (227: 2), (228: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
