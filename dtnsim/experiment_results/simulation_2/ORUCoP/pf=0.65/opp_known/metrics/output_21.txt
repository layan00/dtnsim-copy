The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
464(1 to 12), 467(6 to 3), 485(8 to 2), 493(4 to 5), 500(2 to 4), 501(9 to 10), 502(12 to 11), 508(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(467: 35.000000), (485: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(464: 2), (467: 4), (485: 6), (500: 1), (501: 6), (508: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
