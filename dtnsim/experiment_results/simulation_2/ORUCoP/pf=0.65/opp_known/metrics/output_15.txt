The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(1 to 12), 177(6 to 3), 194(8 to 2), 200(4 to 5), 205(2 to 4), 206(9 to 10), 207(12 to 11), 215(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(194: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 1), (177: 4), (194: 6), (205: 1), (206: 4), (207: 3), (215: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
