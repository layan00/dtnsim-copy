The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
158(1 to 12), 161(6 to 3), 177(8 to 2), 183(4 to 5), 188(2 to 4), 189(9 to 10), 190(12 to 11), 195(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(161: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(158: 1), (161: 4), (177: 4), (189: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 158: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 161: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 161: (to: 3, time: 60.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 177: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 189: (to: 15, time: 80.000000), (to: 15, time: 80.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13:
