The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1222(1 to 12), 1227(6 to 3), 1243(8 to 2), 1253(4 to 5), 1258(2 to 4), 1259(9 to 10), 1260(12 to 11), 1266(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1227: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1227: 6), (1243: 4), (1259: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
