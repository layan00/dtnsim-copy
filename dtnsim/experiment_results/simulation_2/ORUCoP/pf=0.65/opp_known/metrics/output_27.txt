The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
684(1 to 12), 688(6 to 3), 707(8 to 2), 719(4 to 5), 725(2 to 4), 726(9 to 10), 727(12 to 11), 733(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(688: 35.000000), (707: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(684: 2), (688: 6), (707: 6), (719: 1), (726: 4), (727: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
