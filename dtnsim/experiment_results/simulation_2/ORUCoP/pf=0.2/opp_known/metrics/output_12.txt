The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
849(1 to 12), 853(6 to 3), 871(8 to 2), 879(4 to 5), 889(2 to 4), 890(9 to 10), 891(12 to 11), 902(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(853: 35.000000), (871: 60.000000), (890: 20.000000), (891: 20.000000), (902: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(849: 2), (853: 4), (871: 5), (889: 2), (890: 8), (891: 3), (902: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
