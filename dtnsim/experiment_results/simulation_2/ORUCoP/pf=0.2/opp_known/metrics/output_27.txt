The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
879(1 to 12), 884(6 to 3), 904(8 to 2), 916(4 to 5), 927(2 to 4), 928(9 to 10), 929(12 to 11), 961(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(879: 45.000000), (884: 35.000000), (904: 60.000000), (916: 5.000000), (928: 20.000000), (929: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(879: 4), (884: 10), (904: 20), (916: 4), (927: 6), (928: 8), (929: 6), (961: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
