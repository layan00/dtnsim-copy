The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1207(1 to 12), 1211(6 to 3), 1231(8 to 2), 1242(4 to 5), 1252(2 to 4), 1253(9 to 10), 1254(12 to 11), 1276(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1207: 25.000000), (1242: 5.000000), (1253: 20.000000), (1254: 20.000000), (1276: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1207: 4), (1211: 4), (1231: 19), (1242: 4), (1252: 1), (1253: 6), (1254: 6), (1276: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
