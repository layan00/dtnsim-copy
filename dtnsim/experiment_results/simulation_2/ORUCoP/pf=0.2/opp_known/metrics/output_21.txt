The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
551(1 to 12), 555(6 to 3), 575(8 to 2), 587(4 to 5), 598(2 to 4), 599(9 to 10), 600(12 to 11), 615(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(551: 25.000000), (555: 35.000000), (599: 20.000000), (615: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(551: 4), (555: 4), (575: 8), (587: 2), (598: 4), (599: 8), (615: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
