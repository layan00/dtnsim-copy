The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1270(1 to 12), 1275(6 to 3), 1295(8 to 2), 1306(4 to 5), 1315(2 to 4), 1316(9 to 10), 1317(12 to 11), 1329(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1270: 25.000000), (1275: 35.000000), (1316: 60.000000), (1317: 20.000000), (1329: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1270: 4), (1275: 4), (1295: 11), (1306: 1), (1315: 1), (1316: 9), (1317: 3), (1329: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
