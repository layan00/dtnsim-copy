The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
204(1 to 12), 210(6 to 3), 230(8 to 2), 242(4 to 5), 251(2 to 4), 252(9 to 10), 253(12 to 11), 264(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(204: 25.000000), (210: 35.000000), (252: 20.000000), (264: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(204: 3), (210: 7), (230: 8), (252: 8), (264: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
