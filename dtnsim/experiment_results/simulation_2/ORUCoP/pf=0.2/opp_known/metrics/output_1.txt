The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
578(1 to 12), 584(6 to 3), 604(8 to 2), 615(4 to 5), 625(2 to 4), 626(9 to 10), 627(12 to 11), 654(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(578: 45.000000), (584: 35.000000), (604: 60.000000), (615: 5.000000), (626: 20.000000), (627: 20.000000), (654: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(578: 3), (584: 10), (604: 20), (615: 4), (625: 1), (626: 6), (627: 6), (654: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
