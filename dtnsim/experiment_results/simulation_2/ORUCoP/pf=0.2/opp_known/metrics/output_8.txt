The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1246(1 to 12), 1252(6 to 3), 1273(8 to 2), 1286(4 to 5), 1297(2 to 4), 1298(9 to 10), 1299(12 to 11), 1313(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1246: 25.000000), (1252: 35.000000), (1273: 60.000000), (1298: 20.000000), (1299: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1246: 4), (1252: 6), (1273: 12), (1286: 1), (1297: 3), (1298: 8), (1299: 3), (1313: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
