The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(1 to 12), 215(6 to 3), 236(8 to 2), 248(4 to 5), 260(2 to 4), 261(9 to 10), 262(12 to 11), 303(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 45.000000), (215: 35.000000), (236: 60.000000), (248: 5.000000), (260: 20.000000), (261: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 4), (215: 9), (236: 19), (248: 8), (260: 15), (261: 6), (262: 5), (303: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
