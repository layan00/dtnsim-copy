The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 12), 206(6 to 3), 225(8 to 2), 233(4 to 5), 243(2 to 4), 244(9 to 10), 245(12 to 11), 256(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 25.000000), (206: 35.000000), (225: 60.000000), (245: 20.000000), (256: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 3), (206: 4), (225: 9), (243: 1), (244: 4), (245: 3), (256: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
