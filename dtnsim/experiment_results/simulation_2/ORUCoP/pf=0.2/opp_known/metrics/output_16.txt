The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
521(1 to 12), 525(6 to 3), 544(8 to 2), 555(4 to 5), 564(2 to 4), 565(9 to 10), 566(12 to 11), 574(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(521: 25.000000), (525: 35.000000), (544: 60.000000), (565: 60.000000), (574: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(521: 4), (525: 4), (544: 6), (555: 1), (564: 2), (565: 6), (574: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
