The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
908(1 to 12), 913(6 to 3), 935(8 to 2), 949(4 to 5), 959(2 to 4), 960(9 to 10), 961(12 to 11), 971(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(908: 25.000000), (913: 35.000000), (960: 20.000000), (971: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(908: 4), (913: 7), (935: 5), (949: 2), (959: 2), (960: 8), (971: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
