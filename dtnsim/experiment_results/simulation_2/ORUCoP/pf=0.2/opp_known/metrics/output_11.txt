The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
515(1 to 12), 520(6 to 3), 540(8 to 2), 552(4 to 5), 560(2 to 4), 561(9 to 10), 562(12 to 11), 586(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(515: 65.000000), (520: 55.000000), (552: 5.000000), (562: 20.000000), (586: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(515: 4), (520: 10), (540: 14), (552: 4), (561: 5), (562: 6), (586: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
