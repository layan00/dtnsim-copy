The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
931(1 to 12), 936(6 to 3), 955(8 to 2), 965(4 to 5), 977(2 to 4), 978(9 to 10), 979(12 to 11), 1008(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(931: 45.000000), (936: 35.000000), (965: 5.000000), (977: 60.000000), (978: 60.000000), (979: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(931: 4), (936: 4), (955: 14), (965: 4), (977: 8), (978: 6), (979: 6), (1008: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
