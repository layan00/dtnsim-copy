The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
876(1 to 12), 881(6 to 3), 901(8 to 2), 913(4 to 5), 924(2 to 4), 925(9 to 10), 926(12 to 11), 940(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(876: 65.000000), (881: 35.000000), (901: 60.000000), (925: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(876: 4), (881: 6), (901: 11), (913: 1), (924: 3), (925: 6), (926: 2), (940: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
