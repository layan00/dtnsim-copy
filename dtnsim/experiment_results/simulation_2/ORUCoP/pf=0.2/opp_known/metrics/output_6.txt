The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
538(1 to 12), 543(6 to 3), 563(8 to 2), 574(4 to 5), 585(2 to 4), 586(9 to 10), 587(12 to 11), 607(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(538: 25.000000), (543: 35.000000), (563: 60.000000), (574: 25.000000), (585: 60.000000), (586: 20.000000), (607: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(538: 4), (543: 4), (563: 22), (574: 5), (585: 9), (586: 10), (587: 8), (607: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
