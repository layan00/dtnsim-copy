The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1563(1 to 12), 1569(6 to 3), 1590(8 to 2), 1603(4 to 5), 1614(2 to 4), 1615(9 to 10), 1616(12 to 11), 1630(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1563: 25.000000), (1569: 35.000000), (1590: 60.000000), (1615: 60.000000), (1616: 20.000000), (1630: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1563: 4), (1569: 6), (1590: 12), (1603: 1), (1614: 3), (1615: 10), (1616: 3), (1630: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
