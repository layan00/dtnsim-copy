The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
683(1 to 12), 699(6 to 3), 731(8 to 2), 743(4 to 5), 769(2 to 4), 770(9 to 10), 771(12 to 11), 793(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(683: 25.000000), (699: 35.000000), (770: 20.000000), (793: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(683: 4), (699: 6), (731: 8), (743: 6), (769: 8), (770: 6), (793: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 154 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
