The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(1 to 12), 234(6 to 3), 267(8 to 2), 275(4 to 5), 296(2 to 4), 297(9 to 10), 298(12 to 11), 307(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(216: 25.000000), (267: 60.000000), (297: 20.000000), (307: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 3), (234: 7), (267: 6), (297: 8), (307: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 159 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
