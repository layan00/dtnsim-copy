The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1176(1 to 12), 1193(6 to 3), 1228(8 to 2), 1242(4 to 5), 1267(2 to 4), 1268(9 to 10), 1269(12 to 11), 1281(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1176: 25.000000), (1268: 20.000000), (1281: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1176: 4), (1193: 8), (1228: 6), (1242: 6), (1267: 4), (1268: 6), (1281: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 215 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
