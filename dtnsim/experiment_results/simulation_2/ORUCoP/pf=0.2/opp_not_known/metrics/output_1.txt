The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
714(1 to 12), 732(6 to 3), 765(8 to 2), 776(4 to 5), 801(2 to 4), 802(9 to 10), 803(12 to 11), 826(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(714: 45.000000), (732: 55.000000), (765: 60.000000), (802: 20.000000), (803: 20.000000), (826: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(714: 3), (732: 17), (765: 13), (776: 6), (801: 6), (802: 6), (803: 8), (826: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 271 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
