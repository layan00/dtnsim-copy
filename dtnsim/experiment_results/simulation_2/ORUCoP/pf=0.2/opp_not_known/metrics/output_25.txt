The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(1 to 12), 231(6 to 3), 264(8 to 2), 276(4 to 5), 302(2 to 4), 303(9 to 10), 304(12 to 11), 325(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 45.000000), (231: 55.000000), (264: 60.000000), (304: 20.000000), (325: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 4), (231: 15), (264: 9), (276: 6), (303: 3), (304: 6), (325: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 252 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
