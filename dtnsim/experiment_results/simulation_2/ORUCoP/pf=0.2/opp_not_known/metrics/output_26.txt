The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
671(1 to 12), 687(6 to 3), 721(8 to 2), 729(4 to 5), 751(2 to 4), 752(9 to 10), 753(12 to 11), 770(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(671: 25.000000), (687: 55.000000), (721: 60.000000), (752: 60.000000), (753: 20.000000), (770: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(671: 3), (687: 14), (721: 7), (752: 5), (753: 6), (770: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 190 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
