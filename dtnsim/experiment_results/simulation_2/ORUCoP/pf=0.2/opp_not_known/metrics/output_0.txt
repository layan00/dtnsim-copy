The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(1 to 12), 239(6 to 3), 273(8 to 2), 285(4 to 5), 311(2 to 4), 312(9 to 10), 313(12 to 11), 350(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 45.000000), (273: 60.000000), (311: 20.000000), (312: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 4), (239: 15), (273: 19), (285: 6), (311: 15), (312: 6), (313: 7), (350: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 285 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
