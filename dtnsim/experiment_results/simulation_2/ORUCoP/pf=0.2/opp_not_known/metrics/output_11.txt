The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
653(1 to 12), 670(6 to 3), 703(8 to 2), 711(4 to 5), 731(2 to 4), 732(9 to 10), 733(12 to 11), 753(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(653: 65.000000), (670: 55.000000), (703: 60.000000), (711: 5.000000), (733: 20.000000), (753: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(653: 4), (670: 14), (703: 7), (711: 4), (732: 5), (733: 6), (753: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 158 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
