The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(1 to 12), 230(6 to 3), 261(8 to 2), 268(4 to 5), 290(2 to 4), 291(9 to 10), 292(12 to 11), 305(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 25.000000), (230: 35.000000), (261: 60.000000), (292: 20.000000), (305: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 3), (230: 4), (261: 8), (290: 8), (291: 4), (292: 6), (305: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 184 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
