The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
668(1 to 12), 685(6 to 3), 717(8 to 2), 728(4 to 5), 754(2 to 4), 755(9 to 10), 756(12 to 11), 783(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(668: 25.000000), (685: 35.000000), (717: 60.000000), (754: 20.000000), (755: 20.000000), (783: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(668: 4), (685: 10), (717: 22), (728: 6), (754: 18), (755: 10), (756: 12), (783: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 237 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
