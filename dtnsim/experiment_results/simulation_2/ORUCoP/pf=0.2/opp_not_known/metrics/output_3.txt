The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1656(1 to 12), 1673(6 to 3), 1705(8 to 2), 1714(4 to 5), 1735(2 to 4), 1736(9 to 10), 1737(12 to 11), 1750(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1656: 25.000000), (1673: 35.000000), (1737: 20.000000), (1750: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1656: 5), (1673: 4), (1705: 6), (1714: 2), (1735: 8), (1736: 6), (1737: 6), (1750: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 196 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
