The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1619(1 to 12), 1636(6 to 3), 1667(8 to 2), 1674(4 to 5), 1695(2 to 4), 1696(9 to 10), 1697(12 to 11), 1707(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1619: 45.000000), (1667: 60.000000), (1696: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1619: 3), (1636: 4), (1667: 7), (1674: 2), (1695: 2), (1696: 6), (1707: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 184 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
