The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1558(1 to 12), 1576(6 to 3), 1611(8 to 2), 1624(4 to 5), 1650(2 to 4), 1651(9 to 10), 1652(12 to 11), 1688(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1558: 25.000000), (1576: 55.000000), (1650: 60.000000), (1651: 60.000000), (1652: 20.000000), (1688: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1558: 4), (1576: 15), (1611: 13), (1624: 6), (1650: 16), (1651: 5), (1652: 6), (1688: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 243 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
