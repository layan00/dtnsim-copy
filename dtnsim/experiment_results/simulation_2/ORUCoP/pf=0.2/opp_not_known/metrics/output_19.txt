The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2016(1 to 12), 2031(6 to 3), 2062(8 to 2), 2073(4 to 5), 2099(2 to 4), 2100(9 to 10), 2101(12 to 11), 2138(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2016: 45.000000), (2031: 35.000000), (2099: 20.000000), (2100: 20.000000), (2101: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2016: 4), (2031: 9), (2062: 21), (2073: 7), (2099: 15), (2100: 6), (2101: 6), (2138: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 165 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
