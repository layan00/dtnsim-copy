The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
658(1 to 12), 674(6 to 3), 705(8 to 2), 716(4 to 5), 740(2 to 4), 741(9 to 10), 742(12 to 11), 754(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(658: 25.000000), (674: 35.000000), (705: 60.000000), (741: 60.000000), (754: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(658: 5), (674: 5), (705: 7), (716: 6), (740: 4), (741: 6), (754: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 222 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
