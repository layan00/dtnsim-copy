The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(1 to 12), 228(6 to 3), 260(8 to 2), 269(4 to 5), 292(2 to 4), 293(9 to 10), 294(12 to 11), 314(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(293: 60.000000), (294: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(211: 3), (228: 4), (260: 9), (269: 6), (292: 6), (293: 6), (294: 6), (314: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 245 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
