The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
69(1 to 12), 75(6 to 3), 83(8 to 2), 87(4 to 5), 98(2 to 4), 99(9 to 10), 100(12 to 11), 129(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(69: 45.000000), (75: 55.000000), (87: 5.000000), (100: 20.000000), (129: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(69: 4), (75: 13), (83: 7), (87: 4), (99: 3), (100: 6), (129: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
