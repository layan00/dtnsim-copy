The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
72(1 to 12), 78(6 to 3), 86(8 to 2), 90(4 to 5), 99(2 to 4), 100(9 to 10), 101(12 to 11), 113(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(72: 25.000000), (100: 20.000000), (113: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(72: 3), (78: 6), (86: 2), (100: 4), (113: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
