The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
555(1 to 12), 560(6 to 3), 567(8 to 2), 570(4 to 5), 579(2 to 4), 580(9 to 10), 581(12 to 11), 591(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(555: 45.000000), (580: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(555: 3), (567: 2), (570: 2), (579: 1), (580: 4), (591: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
