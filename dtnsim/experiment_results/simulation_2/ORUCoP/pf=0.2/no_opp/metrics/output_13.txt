The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
505(1 to 12), 511(6 to 3), 521(8 to 2), 526(4 to 5), 537(2 to 4), 538(9 to 10), 539(12 to 11), 573(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(505: 25.000000), (511: 55.000000), (526: 5.000000), (537: 60.000000), (538: 60.000000), (539: 20.000000), (573: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(505: 4), (511: 13), (521: 7), (526: 4), (537: 8), (538: 5), (539: 6), (573: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
