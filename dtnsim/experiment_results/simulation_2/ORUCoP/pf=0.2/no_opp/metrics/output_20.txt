The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
75(1 to 12), 81(6 to 3), 90(8 to 2), 94(4 to 5), 104(2 to 4), 105(9 to 10), 106(12 to 11), 137(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(75: 25.000000), (90: 60.000000), (104: 60.000000), (105: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(75: 3), (81: 13), (90: 13), (104: 8), (105: 6), (106: 5), (137: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
