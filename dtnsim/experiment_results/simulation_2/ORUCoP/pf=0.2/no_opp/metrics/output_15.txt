The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
67(1 to 12), 72(6 to 3), 80(8 to 2), 83(4 to 5), 91(2 to 4), 92(9 to 10), 93(12 to 11), 108(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(92: 60.000000), (93: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(67: 2), (72: 4), (83: 1), (91: 3), (92: 6), (93: 3), (108: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
