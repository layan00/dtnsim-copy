The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
515(1 to 12), 521(6 to 3), 530(8 to 2), 535(4 to 5), 546(2 to 4), 547(9 to 10), 548(12 to 11), 562(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(515: 25.000000), (547: 20.000000), (548: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(515: 4), (521: 4), (535: 1), (546: 3), (547: 8), (548: 3), (562: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
