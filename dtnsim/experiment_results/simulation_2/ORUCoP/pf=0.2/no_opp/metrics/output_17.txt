The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
319(1 to 12), 323(6 to 3), 328(8 to 2), 331(4 to 5), 343(2 to 4), 344(9 to 10), 345(12 to 11), 381(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(319: 45.000000), (323: 55.000000), (331: 5.000000), (343: 60.000000), (344: 60.000000), (345: 20.000000), (381: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(319: 4), (323: 14), (328: 10), (331: 4), (343: 8), (344: 7), (345: 6), (381: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
