The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
346(1 to 12), 350(6 to 3), 356(8 to 2), 360(4 to 5), 370(2 to 4), 371(9 to 10), 372(12 to 11), 392(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(356: 60.000000), (371: 20.000000), (372: 20.000000), (392: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(346: 2), (350: 2), (356: 13), (370: 2), (371: 8), (372: 6), (392: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
