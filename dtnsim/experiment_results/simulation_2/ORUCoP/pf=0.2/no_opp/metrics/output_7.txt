The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
369(1 to 12), 374(6 to 3), 384(8 to 2), 390(4 to 5), 400(2 to 4), 401(9 to 10), 402(12 to 11), 413(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(369: 25.000000), (401: 20.000000), (413: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(369: 4), (374: 2), (384: 2), (390: 2), (400: 2), (401: 4), (413: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
