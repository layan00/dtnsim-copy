The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
491(1 to 12), 496(6 to 3), 501(8 to 2), 504(4 to 5), 513(2 to 4), 514(9 to 10), 515(12 to 11), 532(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(491: 65.000000), (513: 60.000000), (514: 20.000000), (532: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(491: 3), (496: 6), (501: 2), (513: 5), (514: 4), (532: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
