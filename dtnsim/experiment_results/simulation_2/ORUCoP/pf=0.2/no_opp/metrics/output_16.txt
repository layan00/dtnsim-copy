The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
197(1 to 12), 201(6 to 3), 208(8 to 2), 213(4 to 5), 222(2 to 4), 223(9 to 10), 224(12 to 11), 233(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(197: 25.000000), (233: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(197: 4), (201: 2), (213: 1), (222: 2), (223: 1), (233: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 197: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000),
