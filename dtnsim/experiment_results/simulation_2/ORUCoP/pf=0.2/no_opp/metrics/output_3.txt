The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
585(1 to 12), 590(6 to 3), 598(8 to 2), 603(4 to 5), 612(2 to 4), 613(9 to 10), 614(12 to 11), 623(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(585: 25.000000), (614: 20.000000), (623: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(585: 4), (603: 1), (612: 1), (613: 6), (614: 3), (623: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
