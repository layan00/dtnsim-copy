The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
627(1 to 12), 630(6 to 3), 637(8 to 2), 642(4 to 5), 653(2 to 4), 654(9 to 10), 655(12 to 11), 691(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(627: 45.000000), (642: 5.000000), (653: 60.000000), (654: 20.000000), (655: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(627: 4), (630: 14), (637: 12), (642: 4), (653: 8), (654: 6), (655: 6), (691: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
