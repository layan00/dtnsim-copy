The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
381(1 to 12), 386(6 to 3), 394(8 to 2), 398(4 to 5), 409(2 to 4), 410(9 to 10), 411(12 to 11), 446(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(381: 45.000000), (394: 60.000000), (398: 5.000000), (410: 20.000000), (411: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(381: 4), (386: 14), (394: 14), (398: 4), (409: 6), (410: 8), (411: 6), (446: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
