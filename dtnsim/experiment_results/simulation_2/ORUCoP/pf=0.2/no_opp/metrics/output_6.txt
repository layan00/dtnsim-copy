The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 12), 220(6 to 3), 228(8 to 2), 233(4 to 5), 244(2 to 4), 245(9 to 10), 246(12 to 11), 271(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 25.000000), (271: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 4), (220: 8), (228: 4), (233: 3), (244: 5), (246: 2), (271: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
