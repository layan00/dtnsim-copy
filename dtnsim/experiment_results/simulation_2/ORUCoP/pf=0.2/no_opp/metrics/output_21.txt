The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(1 to 12), 241(6 to 3), 249(8 to 2), 255(4 to 5), 266(2 to 4), 267(9 to 10), 268(12 to 11), 286(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(237: 25.000000), (267: 20.000000), (286: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 4), (241: 6), (249: 2), (255: 2), (266: 4), (267: 4), (286: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
