The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
684(1 to 12), 690(6 to 3), 699(8 to 2), 704(4 to 5), 714(2 to 4), 715(9 to 10), 716(12 to 11), 732(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(684: 25.000000), (714: 60.000000), (732: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(684: 4), (690: 6), (699: 2), (704: 2), (714: 5), (732: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
