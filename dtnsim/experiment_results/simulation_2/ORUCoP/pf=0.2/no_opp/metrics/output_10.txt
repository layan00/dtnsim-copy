The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
69(1 to 12), 74(6 to 3), 81(8 to 2), 85(4 to 5), 95(2 to 4), 96(9 to 10), 97(12 to 11), 114(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(69: 25.000000), (97: 20.000000), (114: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(69: 3), (81: 8), (95: 1), (96: 4), (97: 6), (114: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
