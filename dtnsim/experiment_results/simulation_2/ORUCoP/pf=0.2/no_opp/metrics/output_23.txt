The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
512(1 to 12), 516(6 to 3), 524(8 to 2), 529(4 to 5), 539(2 to 4), 540(9 to 10), 541(12 to 11), 561(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(512: 25.000000), (529: 5.000000), (540: 20.000000), (541: 20.000000), (561: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(512: 4), (524: 13), (529: 4), (539: 1), (540: 6), (541: 6), (561: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
