The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
260(1 to 12), 266(6 to 3), 274(8 to 2), 277(4 to 5), 287(2 to 4), 288(9 to 10), 289(12 to 11), 314(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(260: 45.000000), (266: 55.000000), (274: 60.000000), (277: 5.000000), (288: 20.000000), (289: 20.000000), (314: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(260: 3), (266: 7), (274: 14), (277: 4), (287: 1), (288: 6), (289: 6), (314: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
