The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
718(1 to 12), 723(6 to 3), 730(8 to 2), 734(4 to 5), 742(2 to 4), 743(9 to 10), 744(12 to 11), 756(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(718: 65.000000), (743: 20.000000), (744: 20.000000), (756: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(718: 4), (723: 2), (734: 1), (742: 2), (743: 6), (744: 3), (756: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
