The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
688(1 to 12), 694(6 to 3), 702(8 to 2), 705(4 to 5), 716(2 to 4), 717(9 to 10), 718(12 to 11), 732(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(717: 20.000000), (718: 20.000000), (732: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(688: 3), (694: 4), (705: 1), (716: 3), (717: 8), (718: 3), (732: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
