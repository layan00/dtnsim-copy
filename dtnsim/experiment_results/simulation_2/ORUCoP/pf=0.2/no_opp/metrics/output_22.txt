The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
374(1 to 12), 379(6 to 3), 387(8 to 2), 391(4 to 5), 402(2 to 4), 403(9 to 10), 404(12 to 11), 418(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(374: 65.000000), (403: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(374: 4), (379: 4), (391: 1), (402: 3), (403: 6), (404: 2), (418: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
