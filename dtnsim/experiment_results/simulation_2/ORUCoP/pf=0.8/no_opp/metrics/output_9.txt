The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
249(1 to 12), 253(6 to 3), 256(8 to 2), 258(4 to 5), 262(2 to 4), 263(9 to 10), 264(12 to 11), 269(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(253: 1), (263: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
