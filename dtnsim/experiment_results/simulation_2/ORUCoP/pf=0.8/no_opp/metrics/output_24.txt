The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(1 to 12), 249(6 to 3), 252(8 to 2), 255(4 to 5), 260(2 to 4), 261(9 to 10), 262(12 to 11), 272(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 2), (249: 2), (261: 4), (262: 2), (272: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 246: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2:

Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 261: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 272: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 249: (to: 10, time: 60.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7:
