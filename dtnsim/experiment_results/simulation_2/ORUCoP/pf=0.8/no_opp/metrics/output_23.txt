The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(1 to 12), 196(6 to 3), 198(8 to 2), 200(4 to 5), 204(2 to 4), 205(9 to 10), 206(12 to 11), 211(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 1), (205: 1), (211: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 194: (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 211: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 205: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Node 14:
