The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
29(1 to 12), 32(6 to 3), 35(8 to 2), 37(4 to 5), 44(2 to 4), 45(9 to 10), 46(12 to 11), 62(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(29: 2), (35: 8), (45: 4), (46: 5), (62: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
