The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
33(1 to 12), 36(6 to 3), 44(8 to 2), 48(4 to 5), 52(2 to 4), 53(9 to 10), 54(12 to 11), 62(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(33: 2), (36: 1), (53: 2), (54: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 33: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 36: (to: 10, time: 25.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 53: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), (to: 5, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 54: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 54: (to: 9, time: 60.000000), 
Node 13:
