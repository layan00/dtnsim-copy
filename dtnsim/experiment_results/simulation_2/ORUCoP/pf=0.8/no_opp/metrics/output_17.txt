The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
126(1 to 12), 128(6 to 3), 131(8 to 2), 133(4 to 5), 136(2 to 4), 137(9 to 10), 138(12 to 11), 143(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(126: 2), (138: 1), (143: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 126: (to: 5, time: 80.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 143: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 138: (to: 9, time: 60.000000), 
Node 13: 
Node 14: 
Node 15:
