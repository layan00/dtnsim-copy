The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
915(1 to 12), 930(6 to 3), 960(8 to 2), 970(4 to 5), 988(2 to 4), 989(9 to 10), 990(12 to 11), 997(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(930: 6), (960: 4), (970: 1), (988: 2), (989: 3), (997: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 64 calls to RUCoP, which took 234 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
