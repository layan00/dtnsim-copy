The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1278(1 to 12), 1293(6 to 3), 1322(8 to 2), 1330(4 to 5), 1345(2 to 4), 1346(9 to 10), 1347(12 to 11), 1353(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1278: 3), (1293: 6), (1322: 4), (1346: 5), (1347: 8), (1353: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 215 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
