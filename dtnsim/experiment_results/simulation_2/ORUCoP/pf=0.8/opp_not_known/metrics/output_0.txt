The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
173(1 to 12), 188(6 to 3), 215(8 to 2), 221(4 to 5), 240(2 to 4), 241(9 to 10), 242(12 to 11), 252(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(188: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(173: 2), (188: 4), (215: 3), (241: 4), (242: 5), (252: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 232 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
