The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
547(1 to 12), 562(6 to 3), 591(8 to 2), 598(4 to 5), 615(2 to 4), 616(9 to 10), 617(12 to 11), 623(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(623: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(547: 2), (562: 4), (591: 4), (615: 2), (616: 4), (623: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 214 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
