The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
549(1 to 12), 563(6 to 3), 590(8 to 2), 596(4 to 5), 611(2 to 4), 612(9 to 10), 613(12 to 11), 618(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(563: 35.000000), (590: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(563: 4), (590: 6), (612: 6), (618: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 127 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
