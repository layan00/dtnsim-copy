The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
900(1 to 12), 914(6 to 3), 941(8 to 2), 947(4 to 5), 962(2 to 4), 963(9 to 10), 964(12 to 11), 970(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(900: 4), (914: 4), (941: 4), (963: 6), (964: 6), (970: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 206 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
