The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
531(1 to 12), 546(6 to 3), 573(8 to 2), 579(4 to 5), 597(2 to 4), 598(9 to 10), 599(12 to 11), 605(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(573: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(546: 4), (573: 6), (579: 1), (598: 6), (599: 6), (605: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 199 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
