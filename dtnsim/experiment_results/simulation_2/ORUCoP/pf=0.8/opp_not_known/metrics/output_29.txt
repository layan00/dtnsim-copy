The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1643(1 to 12), 1659(6 to 3), 1686(8 to 2), 1692(4 to 5), 1708(2 to 4), 1709(9 to 10), 1710(12 to 11), 1714(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1686: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1643: 2), (1659: 4), (1686: 4), (1709: 5), (1714: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
