The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
907(1 to 12), 921(6 to 3), 948(8 to 2), 954(4 to 5), 971(2 to 4), 972(9 to 10), 973(12 to 11), 977(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(907: 3), (921: 4), (948: 4), (972: 5), (977: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 212 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
