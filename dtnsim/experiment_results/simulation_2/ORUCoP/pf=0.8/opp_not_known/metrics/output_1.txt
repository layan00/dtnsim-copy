The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
542(1 to 12), 556(6 to 3), 585(8 to 2), 592(4 to 5), 607(2 to 4), 608(9 to 10), 609(12 to 11), 615(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(542: 1), (556: 4), (585: 4), (608: 6), (609: 6), (615: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 199 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
