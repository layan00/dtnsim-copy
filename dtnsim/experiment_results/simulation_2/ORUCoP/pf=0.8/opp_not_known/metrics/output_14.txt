The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1646(1 to 12), 1662(6 to 3), 1690(8 to 2), 1698(4 to 5), 1713(2 to 4), 1714(9 to 10), 1715(12 to 11), 1719(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1646: 3), (1662: 4), (1690: 4), (1714: 5), (1719: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 206 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
