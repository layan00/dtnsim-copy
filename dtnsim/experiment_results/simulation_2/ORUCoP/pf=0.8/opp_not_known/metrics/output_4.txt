The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1624(1 to 12), 1639(6 to 3), 1668(8 to 2), 1675(4 to 5), 1691(2 to 4), 1692(9 to 10), 1693(12 to 11), 1699(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1624: 3), (1639: 4), (1668: 4), (1692: 5), (1693: 6), (1699: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 234 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
