The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
543(1 to 12), 557(6 to 3), 584(8 to 2), 590(4 to 5), 607(2 to 4), 608(9 to 10), 609(12 to 11), 613(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(557: 4), (584: 4), (590: 1), (608: 5), (613: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 199 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
