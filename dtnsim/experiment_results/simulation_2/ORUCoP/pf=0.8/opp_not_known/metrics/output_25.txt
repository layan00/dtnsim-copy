The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
160(1 to 12), 175(6 to 3), 201(8 to 2), 207(4 to 5), 222(2 to 4), 223(9 to 10), 224(12 to 11), 228(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(160: 1), (175: 4), (201: 4), (223: 5), (228: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 192 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
