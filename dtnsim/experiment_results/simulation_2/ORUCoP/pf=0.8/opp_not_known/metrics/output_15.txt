The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
177(1 to 12), 192(6 to 3), 221(8 to 2), 227(4 to 5), 244(2 to 4), 245(9 to 10), 246(12 to 11), 257(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(177: 1), (192: 4), (221: 6), (244: 6), (245: 4), (246: 5), (257: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 213 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
