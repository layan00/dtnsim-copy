The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1266(1 to 12), 1281(6 to 3), 1309(8 to 2), 1315(4 to 5), 1334(2 to 4), 1335(9 to 10), 1336(12 to 11), 1343(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1335: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1281: 4), (1309: 7), (1315: 2), (1335: 7), (1343: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 171 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
