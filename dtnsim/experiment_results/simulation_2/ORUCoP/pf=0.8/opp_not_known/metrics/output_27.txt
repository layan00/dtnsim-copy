The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
882(1 to 12), 898(6 to 3), 928(8 to 2), 938(4 to 5), 954(2 to 4), 955(9 to 10), 956(12 to 11), 962(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(928: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(882: 1), (898: 6), (928: 6), (955: 5), (956: 6), (962: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 178 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
