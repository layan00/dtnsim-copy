The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
167(1 to 12), 181(6 to 3), 208(8 to 2), 214(4 to 5), 230(2 to 4), 231(9 to 10), 232(12 to 11), 237(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(181: 4), (208: 4), (231: 4), (237: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 181 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
