The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1263(1 to 12), 1278(6 to 3), 1306(8 to 2), 1312(4 to 5), 1326(2 to 4), 1327(9 to 10), 1328(12 to 11), 1332(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1278: 6), (1306: 4), (1327: 5), (1332: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
