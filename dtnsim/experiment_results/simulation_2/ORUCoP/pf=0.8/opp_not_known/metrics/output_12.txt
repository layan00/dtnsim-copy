The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
910(1 to 12), 924(6 to 3), 951(8 to 2), 957(4 to 5), 974(2 to 4), 975(9 to 10), 976(12 to 11), 985(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(924: 4), (951: 4), (975: 3), (976: 5), (985: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 62 calls to RUCoP, which took 240 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
