The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
171(1 to 12), 186(6 to 3), 215(8 to 2), 221(4 to 5), 235(2 to 4), 236(9 to 10), 237(12 to 11), 241(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(171: 1), (186: 4), (215: 6), (236: 10), (241: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 176 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
