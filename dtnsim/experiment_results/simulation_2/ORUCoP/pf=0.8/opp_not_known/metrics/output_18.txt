The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1271(1 to 12), 1285(6 to 3), 1312(8 to 2), 1319(4 to 5), 1335(2 to 4), 1336(9 to 10), 1337(12 to 11), 1342(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1285: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1271: 2), (1285: 4), (1312: 4), (1336: 6), (1342: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 177 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
