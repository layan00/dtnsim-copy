The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
513(1 to 12), 527(6 to 3), 553(8 to 2), 559(4 to 5), 575(2 to 4), 576(9 to 10), 577(12 to 11), 582(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 4), (553: 4), (576: 5), (582: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 165 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
