The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1282(1 to 12), 1298(6 to 3), 1325(8 to 2), 1332(4 to 5), 1348(2 to 4), 1349(9 to 10), 1350(12 to 11), 1356(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1298: 35.000000), (1349: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1282: 3), (1298: 4), (1325: 6), (1349: 6), (1356: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 171 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
