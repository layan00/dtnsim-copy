The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
914(1 to 12), 929(6 to 3), 955(8 to 2), 961(4 to 5), 977(2 to 4), 978(9 to 10), 979(12 to 11), 983(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(914: 3), (929: 6), (955: 4), (978: 5), (983: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
