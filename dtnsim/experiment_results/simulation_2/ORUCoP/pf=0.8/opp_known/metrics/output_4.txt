The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1134(1 to 12), 1137(6 to 3), 1154(8 to 2), 1161(4 to 5), 1165(2 to 4), 1166(9 to 10), 1167(12 to 11), 1172(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1134: 2), (1137: 4), (1154: 4), (1166: 4), (1167: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
