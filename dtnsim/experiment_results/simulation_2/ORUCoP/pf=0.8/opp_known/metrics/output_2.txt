The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
659(1 to 12), 661(6 to 3), 676(8 to 2), 682(4 to 5), 687(2 to 4), 688(9 to 10), 689(12 to 11), 693(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(659: 2), (661: 4), (676: 4), (688: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
