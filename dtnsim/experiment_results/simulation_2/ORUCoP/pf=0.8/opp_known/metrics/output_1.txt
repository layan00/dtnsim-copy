The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
417(1 to 12), 419(6 to 3), 436(8 to 2), 443(4 to 5), 446(2 to 4), 447(9 to 10), 448(12 to 11), 453(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(417: 1), (419: 4), (436: 4), (447: 6), (448: 3), (453: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
