The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
910(1 to 12), 914(6 to 3), 929(8 to 2), 936(4 to 5), 940(2 to 4), 941(9 to 10), 942(12 to 11), 947(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(914: 35.000000), (941: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(910: 2), (914: 4), (929: 4), (941: 11), (947: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
