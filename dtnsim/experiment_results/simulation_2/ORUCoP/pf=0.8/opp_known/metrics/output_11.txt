The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
402(1 to 12), 405(6 to 3), 420(8 to 2), 426(4 to 5), 432(2 to 4), 433(9 to 10), 434(12 to 11), 439(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(420: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(405: 4), (420: 6), (426: 1), (433: 6), (434: 3), (439: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
