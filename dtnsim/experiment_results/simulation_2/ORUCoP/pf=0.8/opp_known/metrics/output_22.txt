The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
660(1 to 12), 663(6 to 3), 680(8 to 2), 690(4 to 5), 696(2 to 4), 697(9 to 10), 698(12 to 11), 704(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(663: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(663: 6), (680: 4), (690: 1), (696: 1), (697: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
