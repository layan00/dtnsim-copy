The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
148(1 to 12), 151(6 to 3), 165(8 to 2), 171(4 to 5), 174(2 to 4), 175(9 to 10), 176(12 to 11), 180(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(148: 1), (151: 4), (165: 4), (175: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 148: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), 
Node 2:

Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 151: (to: 13, time: 40.000000), (to: 13, time: 80.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 165: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 80.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 175: (to: 15, time: 80.000000), (to: 15, time: 80.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Bundle 151: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), (to: 7, time: 80.000000),
