The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
407(1 to 12), 409(6 to 3), 424(8 to 2), 430(4 to 5), 435(2 to 4), 436(9 to 10), 437(12 to 11), 441(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(409: 4), (424: 4), (430: 1), (436: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
