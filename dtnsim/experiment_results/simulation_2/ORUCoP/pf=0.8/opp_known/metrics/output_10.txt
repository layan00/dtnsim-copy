The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
155(1 to 12), 157(6 to 3), 172(8 to 2), 178(4 to 5), 182(2 to 4), 183(9 to 10), 184(12 to 11), 188(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(157: 4), (172: 4), (183: 6), (188: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
