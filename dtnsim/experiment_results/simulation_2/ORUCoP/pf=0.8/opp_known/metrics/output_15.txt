The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
165(1 to 12), 168(6 to 3), 185(8 to 2), 191(4 to 5), 196(2 to 4), 197(9 to 10), 198(12 to 11), 204(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(185: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(165: 1), (168: 4), (185: 6), (196: 1), (197: 6), (198: 3), (204: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
