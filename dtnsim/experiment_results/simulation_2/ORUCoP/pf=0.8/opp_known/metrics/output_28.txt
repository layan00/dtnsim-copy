The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
887(1 to 12), 890(6 to 3), 906(8 to 2), 912(4 to 5), 919(2 to 4), 920(9 to 10), 921(12 to 11), 928(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(920: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(890: 4), (906: 6), (912: 2), (920: 7), (928: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
