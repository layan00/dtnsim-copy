The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1149(1 to 12), 1153(6 to 3), 1169(8 to 2), 1177(4 to 5), 1180(2 to 4), 1181(9 to 10), 1182(12 to 11), 1186(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1149: 2), (1153: 4), (1169: 4), (1181: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
