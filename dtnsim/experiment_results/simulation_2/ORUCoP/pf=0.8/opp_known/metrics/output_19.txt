The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1129(1 to 12), 1131(6 to 3), 1145(8 to 2), 1151(4 to 5), 1155(2 to 4), 1156(9 to 10), 1157(12 to 11), 1161(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1131: 4), (1145: 4), (1156: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
