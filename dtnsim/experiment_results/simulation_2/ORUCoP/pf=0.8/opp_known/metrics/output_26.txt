The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
380(1 to 12), 382(6 to 3), 396(8 to 2), 402(4 to 5), 406(2 to 4), 407(9 to 10), 408(12 to 11), 413(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(382: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(382: 4), (396: 4), (407: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
