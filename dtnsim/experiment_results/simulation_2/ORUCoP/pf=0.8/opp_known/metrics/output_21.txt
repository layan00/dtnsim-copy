The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
414(1 to 12), 416(6 to 3), 431(8 to 2), 437(4 to 5), 440(2 to 4), 441(9 to 10), 442(12 to 11), 447(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(416: 35.000000), (431: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(416: 4), (431: 6), (441: 6), (447: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
