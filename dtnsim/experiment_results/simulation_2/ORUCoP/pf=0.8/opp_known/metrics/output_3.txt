The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
893(1 to 12), 896(6 to 3), 912(8 to 2), 918(4 to 5), 920(2 to 4), 921(9 to 10), 922(12 to 11), 926(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(896: 4), (912: 4), (921: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
