The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
415(1 to 12), 418(6 to 3), 435(8 to 2), 442(4 to 5), 447(2 to 4), 448(9 to 10), 449(12 to 11), 454(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(454: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(415: 2), (418: 4), (435: 4), (447: 1), (448: 4), (454: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
