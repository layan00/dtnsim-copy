The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
161(1 to 12), 164(6 to 3), 179(8 to 2), 185(4 to 5), 192(2 to 4), 193(9 to 10), 194(12 to 11), 201(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(164: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(161: 2), (164: 4), (179: 4), (193: 6), (194: 8), (201: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 123 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
