The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
658(1 to 12), 660(6 to 3), 675(8 to 2), 681(4 to 5), 686(2 to 4), 687(9 to 10), 688(12 to 11), 693(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(660: 4), (675: 4), (687: 4), (688: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
