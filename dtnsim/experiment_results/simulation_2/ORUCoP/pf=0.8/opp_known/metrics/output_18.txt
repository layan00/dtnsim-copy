The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
890(1 to 12), 892(6 to 3), 907(8 to 2), 914(4 to 5), 918(2 to 4), 919(9 to 10), 920(12 to 11), 925(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(892: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(890: 1), (892: 4), (907: 4), (919: 6), (925: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
