The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
629(1 to 12), 633(6 to 3), 650(8 to 2), 660(4 to 5), 664(2 to 4), 665(9 to 10), 666(12 to 11), 671(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(650: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(633: 5), (650: 6), (665: 4), (666: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
