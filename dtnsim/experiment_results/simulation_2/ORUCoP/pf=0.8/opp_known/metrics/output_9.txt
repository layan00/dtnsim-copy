The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1158(1 to 12), 1162(6 to 3), 1177(8 to 2), 1187(4 to 5), 1191(2 to 4), 1192(9 to 10), 1193(12 to 11), 1197(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1162: 5), (1177: 4), (1192: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
