The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
643(1 to 12), 645(6 to 3), 660(8 to 2), 666(4 to 5), 669(2 to 4), 670(9 to 10), 671(12 to 11), 676(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(643: 2), (645: 4), (660: 4), (670: 6), (671: 3), (676: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
