The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
440(1 to 12), 446(6 to 3), 456(8 to 2), 461(4 to 5), 470(2 to 4), 471(9 to 10), 472(12 to 11), 506(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(440: 25.000000), (446: 55.000000), (461: 5.000000), (470: 60.000000), (471: 60.000000), (472: 20.000000), (506: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(440: 4), (446: 13), (456: 6), (461: 4), (470: 8), (471: 5), (472: 6), (506: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
