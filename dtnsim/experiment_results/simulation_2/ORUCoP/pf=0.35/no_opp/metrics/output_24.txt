The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
558(1 to 12), 564(6 to 3), 570(8 to 2), 575(4 to 5), 585(2 to 4), 586(9 to 10), 587(12 to 11), 598(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(558: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(558: 4), (564: 2), (575: 1), (585: 2), (586: 6), (587: 2), (598: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
