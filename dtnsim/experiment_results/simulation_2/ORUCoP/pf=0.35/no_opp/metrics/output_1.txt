The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
242(1 to 12), 248(6 to 3), 255(8 to 2), 258(4 to 5), 264(2 to 4), 265(9 to 10), 266(12 to 11), 271(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(271: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(242: 2), (248: 1), (258: 1), (266: 1), (271: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 242: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), 
Bundle 271: (to: 4, time: 80.000000),
