The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
182(1 to 12), 186(6 to 3), 193(8 to 2), 198(4 to 5), 209(2 to 4), 210(9 to 10), 211(12 to 11), 236(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(182: 25.000000), (236: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(182: 4), (186: 8), (193: 4), (198: 3), (209: 5), (211: 2), (236: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
