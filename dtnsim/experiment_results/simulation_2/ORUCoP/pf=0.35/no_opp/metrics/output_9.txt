The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
551(1 to 12), 556(6 to 3), 563(8 to 2), 568(4 to 5), 575(2 to 4), 576(9 to 10), 577(12 to 11), 583(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(551: 25.000000), (583: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(551: 3), (556: 2), (576: 1), (583: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 551: (to: 4, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2:
