The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
53(1 to 12), 58(6 to 3), 65(8 to 2), 67(4 to 5), 72(2 to 4), 73(9 to 10), 74(12 to 11), 83(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(53: 1), (72: 1), (73: 5), (74: 2), (83: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 53: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 72: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 73: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), (to: 12, time: 80.000000),
