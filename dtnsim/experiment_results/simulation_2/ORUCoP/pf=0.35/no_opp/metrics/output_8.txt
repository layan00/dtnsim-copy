The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
431(1 to 12), 437(6 to 3), 445(8 to 2), 450(4 to 5), 459(2 to 4), 460(9 to 10), 461(12 to 11), 475(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(431: 25.000000), (460: 20.000000), (461: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(431: 4), (437: 4), (450: 1), (459: 3), (460: 8), (461: 3), (475: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
