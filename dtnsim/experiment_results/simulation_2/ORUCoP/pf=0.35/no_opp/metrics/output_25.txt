The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
59(1 to 12), 63(6 to 3), 69(8 to 2), 72(4 to 5), 82(2 to 4), 83(9 to 10), 84(12 to 11), 109(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(59: 45.000000), (63: 55.000000), (72: 5.000000), (84: 20.000000), (109: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(59: 3), (63: 7), (69: 6), (72: 4), (83: 3), (84: 6), (109: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
