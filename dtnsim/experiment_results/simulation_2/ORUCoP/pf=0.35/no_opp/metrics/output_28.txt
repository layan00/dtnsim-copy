The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
419(1 to 12), 424(6 to 3), 430(8 to 2), 433(4 to 5), 440(2 to 4), 441(9 to 10), 442(12 to 11), 450(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(419: 45.000000), (441: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(419: 3), (430: 1), (433: 2), (441: 4), (450: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
