The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
587(1 to 12), 592(6 to 3), 598(8 to 2), 602(4 to 5), 609(2 to 4), 610(9 to 10), 611(12 to 11), 617(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(587: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(587: 3), (592: 1), (598: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 587: (to: 4, time: 15.000000), (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 587: (to: 12, time: 40.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 592: (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 598: (to: 12, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11:
