The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
301(1 to 12), 305(6 to 3), 310(8 to 2), 313(4 to 5), 323(2 to 4), 324(9 to 10), 325(12 to 11), 342(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(324: 20.000000), (325: 20.000000), (342: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(301: 1), (305: 2), (310: 6), (323: 2), (324: 8), (325: 7), (342: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
