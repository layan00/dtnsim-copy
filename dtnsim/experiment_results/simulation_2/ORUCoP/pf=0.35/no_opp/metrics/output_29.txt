The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
528(1 to 12), 533(6 to 3), 539(8 to 2), 542(4 to 5), 551(2 to 4), 552(9 to 10), 553(12 to 11), 563(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(528: 3), (533: 2), (542: 1), (552: 4), (553: 2), (563: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
