The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
300(1 to 12), 305(6 to 3), 313(8 to 2), 317(4 to 5), 325(2 to 4), 326(9 to 10), 327(12 to 11), 336(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(326: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(300: 3), (305: 2), (317: 1), (326: 8), (327: 2), (336: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
