The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
465(1 to 12), 469(6 to 3), 476(8 to 2), 479(4 to 5), 485(2 to 4), 486(9 to 10), 487(12 to 11), 493(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(493: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(465: 2), (479: 1), (485: 1), (486: 3), (493: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
