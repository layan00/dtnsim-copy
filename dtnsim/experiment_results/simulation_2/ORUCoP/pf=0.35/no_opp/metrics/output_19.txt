The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
469(1 to 12), 472(6 to 3), 478(8 to 2), 482(4 to 5), 492(2 to 4), 493(9 to 10), 494(12 to 11), 513(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(469: 45.000000), (492: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(469: 4), (472: 6), (478: 2), (482: 2), (492: 5), (493: 1), (513: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
