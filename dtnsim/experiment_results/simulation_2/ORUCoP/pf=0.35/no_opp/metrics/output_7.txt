The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
310(1 to 12), 314(6 to 3), 320(8 to 2), 323(4 to 5), 331(2 to 4), 332(9 to 10), 333(12 to 11), 341(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(310: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(310: 4), (314: 1), (320: 1), (323: 2), (332: 3), (341: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
