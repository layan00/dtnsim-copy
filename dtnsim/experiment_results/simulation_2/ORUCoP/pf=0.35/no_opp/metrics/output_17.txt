The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
248(1 to 12), 250(6 to 3), 254(8 to 2), 256(4 to 5), 267(2 to 4), 268(9 to 10), 269(12 to 11), 294(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 65.000000), (294: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(248: 3), (250: 8), (254: 4), (256: 3), (267: 5), (269: 2), (294: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
