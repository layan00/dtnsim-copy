The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
437(1 to 12), 441(6 to 3), 448(8 to 2), 453(4 to 5), 461(2 to 4), 462(9 to 10), 463(12 to 11), 471(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(437: 25.000000), (462: 20.000000), (471: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(437: 4), (448: 1), (453: 2), (461: 1), (462: 4), (471: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
