The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
175(1 to 12), 179(6 to 3), 186(8 to 2), 190(4 to 5), 197(2 to 4), 198(9 to 10), 199(12 to 11), 215(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(175: 65.000000), (190: 5.000000), (199: 20.000000), (215: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(175: 5), (186: 4), (190: 4), (198: 5), (199: 6), (215: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
