The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
57(1 to 12), 61(6 to 3), 67(8 to 2), 69(4 to 5), 77(2 to 4), 78(9 to 10), 79(12 to 11), 91(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(78: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(57: 2), (61: 6), (67: 2), (78: 4), (91: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
