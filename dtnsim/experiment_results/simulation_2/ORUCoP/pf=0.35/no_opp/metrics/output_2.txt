The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
351(1 to 12), 356(6 to 3), 361(8 to 2), 364(4 to 5), 373(2 to 4), 374(9 to 10), 375(12 to 11), 388(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(351: 65.000000), (374: 60.000000), (375: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(351: 3), (361: 4), (374: 6), (375: 6), (388: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
