The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
68(1 to 12), 74(6 to 3), 83(8 to 2), 87(4 to 5), 96(2 to 4), 97(9 to 10), 98(12 to 11), 129(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(68: 25.000000), (83: 60.000000), (97: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(68: 3), (74: 12), (83: 14), (96: 6), (97: 7), (98: 6), (129: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
