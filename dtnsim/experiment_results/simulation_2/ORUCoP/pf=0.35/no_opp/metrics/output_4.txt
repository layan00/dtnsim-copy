The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
576(1 to 12), 580(6 to 3), 587(8 to 2), 591(4 to 5), 599(2 to 4), 600(9 to 10), 601(12 to 11), 613(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(576: 65.000000), (600: 60.000000), (601: 20.000000), (613: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(576: 4), (580: 2), (591: 1), (599: 2), (600: 7), (601: 3), (613: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
