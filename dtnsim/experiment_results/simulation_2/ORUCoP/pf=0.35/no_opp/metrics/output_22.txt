The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
319(1 to 12), 323(6 to 3), 331(8 to 2), 336(4 to 5), 346(2 to 4), 347(9 to 10), 348(12 to 11), 358(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(319: 65.000000), (347: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(319: 4), (323: 2), (336: 1), (346: 1), (347: 6), (348: 2), (358: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
