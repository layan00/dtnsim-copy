The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 12), 219(6 to 3), 227(8 to 2), 233(4 to 5), 243(2 to 4), 244(9 to 10), 245(12 to 11), 253(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 25.000000), (253: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 4), (227: 1), (233: 2), (243: 1), (244: 2), (253: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
