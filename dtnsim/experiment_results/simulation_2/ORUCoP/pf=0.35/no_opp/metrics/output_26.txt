The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
183(1 to 12), 185(6 to 3), 191(8 to 2), 195(4 to 5), 204(2 to 4), 205(9 to 10), 206(12 to 11), 219(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(183: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(183: 3), (191: 3), (205: 3), (206: 4), (219: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
