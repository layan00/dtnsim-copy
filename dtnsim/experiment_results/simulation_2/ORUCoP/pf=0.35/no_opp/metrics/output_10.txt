The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
57(1 to 12), 61(6 to 3), 67(8 to 2), 71(4 to 5), 80(2 to 4), 81(9 to 10), 82(12 to 11), 96(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(57: 25.000000), (82: 20.000000), (96: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(57: 3), (67: 4), (80: 1), (81: 4), (82: 6), (96: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
