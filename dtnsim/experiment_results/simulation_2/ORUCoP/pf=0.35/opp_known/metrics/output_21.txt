The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
517(1 to 12), 521(6 to 3), 541(8 to 2), 551(4 to 5), 561(2 to 4), 562(9 to 10), 563(12 to 11), 571(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 25.000000), (521: 35.000000), (541: 60.000000), (571: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(517: 4), (521: 4), (541: 6), (551: 2), (561: 1), (562: 5), (571: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
