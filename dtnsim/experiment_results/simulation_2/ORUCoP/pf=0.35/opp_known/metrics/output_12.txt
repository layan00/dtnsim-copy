The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
802(1 to 12), 806(6 to 3), 823(8 to 2), 829(4 to 5), 839(2 to 4), 840(9 to 10), 841(12 to 11), 852(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(806: 35.000000), (840: 20.000000), (841: 20.000000), (852: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(802: 1), (806: 4), (823: 4), (839: 2), (840: 8), (841: 3), (852: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
