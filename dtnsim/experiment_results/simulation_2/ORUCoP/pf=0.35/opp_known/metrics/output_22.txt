The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
813(1 to 12), 817(6 to 3), 837(8 to 2), 848(4 to 5), 858(2 to 4), 859(9 to 10), 860(12 to 11), 870(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(813: 65.000000), (817: 35.000000), (859: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(813: 4), (817: 6), (837: 4), (848: 1), (858: 1), (859: 8), (860: 2), (870: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
