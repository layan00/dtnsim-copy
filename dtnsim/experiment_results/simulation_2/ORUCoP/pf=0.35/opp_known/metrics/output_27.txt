The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
794(1 to 12), 799(6 to 3), 819(8 to 2), 829(4 to 5), 837(2 to 4), 838(9 to 10), 839(12 to 11), 848(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(799: 35.000000), (819: 60.000000), (838: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(794: 3), (799: 6), (819: 6), (829: 1), (838: 8), (839: 2), (848: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
