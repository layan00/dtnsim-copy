The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(1 to 12), 193(6 to 3), 211(8 to 2), 219(4 to 5), 227(2 to 4), 228(9 to 10), 229(12 to 11), 235(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(211: 60.000000), (228: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 2), (193: 6), (211: 6), (228: 10), (235: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
