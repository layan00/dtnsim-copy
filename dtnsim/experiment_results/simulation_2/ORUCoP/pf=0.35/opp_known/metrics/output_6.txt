The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
504(1 to 12), 508(6 to 3), 527(8 to 2), 536(4 to 5), 547(2 to 4), 548(9 to 10), 549(12 to 11), 563(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(504: 25.000000), (508: 35.000000), (527: 60.000000), (536: 25.000000), (547: 60.000000), (563: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(504: 4), (508: 4), (527: 6), (536: 5), (547: 9), (548: 6), (549: 8), (563: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
