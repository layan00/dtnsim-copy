The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
861(1 to 12), 866(6 to 3), 883(8 to 2), 889(4 to 5), 898(2 to 4), 899(9 to 10), 900(12 to 11), 909(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(861: 65.000000), (866: 35.000000), (883: 60.000000), (899: 60.000000), (900: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(861: 3), (866: 4), (883: 6), (899: 6), (900: 3), (909: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
