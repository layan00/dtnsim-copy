The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1450(1 to 12), 1455(6 to 3), 1474(8 to 2), 1485(4 to 5), 1492(2 to 4), 1493(9 to 10), 1494(12 to 11), 1500(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1450: 25.000000), (1455: 35.000000), (1493: 60.000000), (1500: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1450: 3), (1455: 6), (1474: 4), (1493: 6), (1500: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
