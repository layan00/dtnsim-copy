The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
191(1 to 12), 195(6 to 3), 213(8 to 2), 220(4 to 5), 230(2 to 4), 231(9 to 10), 232(12 to 11), 247(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(191: 45.000000), (195: 35.000000), (213: 60.000000), (220: 5.000000), (232: 20.000000), (247: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 3), (195: 4), (213: 6), (220: 4), (231: 3), (232: 6), (247: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
