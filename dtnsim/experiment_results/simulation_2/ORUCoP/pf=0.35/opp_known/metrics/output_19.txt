The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1383(1 to 12), 1386(6 to 3), 1404(8 to 2), 1412(4 to 5), 1422(2 to 4), 1423(9 to 10), 1424(12 to 11), 1436(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1383: 45.000000), (1386: 35.000000), (1422: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1383: 4), (1386: 4), (1404: 4), (1412: 2), (1422: 5), (1423: 3), (1436: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
