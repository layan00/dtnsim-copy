The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1158(1 to 12), 1162(6 to 3), 1181(8 to 2), 1188(4 to 5), 1194(2 to 4), 1195(9 to 10), 1196(12 to 11), 1203(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1162: 35.000000), (1195: 60.000000), (1203: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1158: 2), (1162: 4), (1181: 4), (1188: 1), (1194: 1), (1195: 10), (1203: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
