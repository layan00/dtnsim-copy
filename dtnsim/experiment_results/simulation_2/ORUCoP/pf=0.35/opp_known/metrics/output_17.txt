The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
763(1 to 12), 765(6 to 3), 781(8 to 2), 786(4 to 5), 798(2 to 4), 799(9 to 10), 800(12 to 11), 814(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(763: 65.000000), (765: 35.000000), (786: 25.000000), (798: 60.000000), (799: 60.000000), (814: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(763: 3), (765: 4), (781: 4), (786: 5), (798: 9), (799: 10), (800: 10), (814: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
