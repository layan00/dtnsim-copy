The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1121(1 to 12), 1125(6 to 3), 1144(8 to 2), 1153(4 to 5), 1161(2 to 4), 1162(9 to 10), 1163(12 to 11), 1170(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1121: 25.000000), (1162: 20.000000), (1170: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1121: 4), (1125: 4), (1144: 4), (1153: 2), (1161: 1), (1162: 8), (1170: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
