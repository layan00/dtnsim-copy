The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1103(1 to 12), 1108(6 to 3), 1126(8 to 2), 1133(4 to 5), 1140(2 to 4), 1141(9 to 10), 1142(12 to 11), 1149(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1103: 45.000000), (1126: 60.000000), (1141: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1103: 3), (1108: 4), (1126: 6), (1133: 2), (1141: 8), (1149: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
