The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
470(1 to 12), 473(6 to 3), 490(8 to 2), 496(4 to 5), 505(2 to 4), 506(9 to 10), 507(12 to 11), 515(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(470: 65.000000), (473: 35.000000), (490: 60.000000), (506: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(470: 2), (473: 4), (490: 6), (496: 1), (505: 2), (506: 6), (515: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
