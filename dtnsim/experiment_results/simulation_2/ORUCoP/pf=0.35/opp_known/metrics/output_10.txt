The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(1 to 12), 193(6 to 3), 211(8 to 2), 218(4 to 5), 227(2 to 4), 228(9 to 10), 229(12 to 11), 238(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(189: 25.000000), (211: 60.000000), (229: 20.000000), (238: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 3), (193: 4), (211: 6), (227: 1), (228: 4), (229: 3), (238: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
