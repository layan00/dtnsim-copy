The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(1 to 12), 206(6 to 3), 227(8 to 2), 237(4 to 5), 246(2 to 4), 247(9 to 10), 248(12 to 11), 268(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(200: 25.000000), (206: 35.000000), (227: 60.000000), (247: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 3), (206: 9), (227: 6), (246: 6), (247: 8), (248: 6), (268: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
