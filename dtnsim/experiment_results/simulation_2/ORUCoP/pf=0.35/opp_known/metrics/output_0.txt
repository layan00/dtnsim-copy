The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 12), 209(6 to 3), 230(8 to 2), 240(4 to 5), 256(2 to 4), 257(9 to 10), 258(12 to 11), 293(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 45.000000), (209: 35.000000), (240: 5.000000), (256: 20.000000), (257: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 4), (209: 9), (230: 4), (240: 14), (256: 14), (257: 8), (258: 6), (293: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 109 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
