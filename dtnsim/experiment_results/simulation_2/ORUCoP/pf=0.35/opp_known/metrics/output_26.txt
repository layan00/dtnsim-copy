The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
492(1 to 12), 494(6 to 3), 512(8 to 2), 519(4 to 5), 528(2 to 4), 529(9 to 10), 530(12 to 11), 539(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(492: 65.000000), (494: 35.000000), (512: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(492: 3), (494: 4), (512: 6), (529: 3), (530: 2), (539: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
