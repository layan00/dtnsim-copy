The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1087(1 to 12), 1092(6 to 3), 1108(8 to 2), 1114(4 to 5), 1120(2 to 4), 1121(9 to 10), 1122(12 to 11), 1127(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1087: 65.000000), (1092: 35.000000), (1108: 60.000000), (1121: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1087: 3), (1092: 4), (1108: 6), (1121: 11), (1127: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
