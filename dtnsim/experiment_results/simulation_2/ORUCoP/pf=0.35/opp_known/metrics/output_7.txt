The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
828(1 to 12), 832(6 to 3), 850(8 to 2), 856(4 to 5), 865(2 to 4), 866(9 to 10), 867(12 to 11), 874(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(828: 65.000000), (832: 35.000000), (866: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(828: 4), (832: 4), (850: 4), (856: 2), (866: 10), (874: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
