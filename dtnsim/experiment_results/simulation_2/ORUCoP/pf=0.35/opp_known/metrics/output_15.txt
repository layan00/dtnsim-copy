The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(1 to 12), 190(6 to 3), 209(8 to 2), 214(4 to 5), 219(2 to 4), 220(9 to 10), 221(12 to 11), 230(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 1), (190: 4), (209: 6), (219: 1), (220: 5), (221: 2), (230: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
