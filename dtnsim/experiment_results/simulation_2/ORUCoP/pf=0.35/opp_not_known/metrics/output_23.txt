The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1516(1 to 12), 1532(6 to 3), 1563(8 to 2), 1572(4 to 5), 1595(2 to 4), 1596(9 to 10), 1597(12 to 11), 1605(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1516: 25.000000), (1596: 20.000000), (1605: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1516: 4), (1532: 4), (1563: 4), (1572: 6), (1595: 2), (1596: 6), (1605: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 223 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
