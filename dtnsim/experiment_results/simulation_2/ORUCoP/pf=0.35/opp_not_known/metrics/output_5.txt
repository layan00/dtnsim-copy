The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 12), 217(6 to 3), 248(8 to 2), 254(4 to 5), 274(2 to 4), 275(9 to 10), 276(12 to 11), 285(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 60.000000), (275: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 4), (217: 7), (248: 6), (275: 8), (285: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 152 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
