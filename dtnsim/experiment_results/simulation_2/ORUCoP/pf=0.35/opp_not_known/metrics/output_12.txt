The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1066(1 to 12), 1082(6 to 3), 1111(8 to 2), 1117(4 to 5), 1139(2 to 4), 1140(9 to 10), 1141(12 to 11), 1157(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1082: 35.000000), (1140: 20.000000), (1141: 20.000000), (1157: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1066: 1), (1082: 5), (1111: 6), (1139: 6), (1140: 8), (1141: 7), (1157: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 190 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
