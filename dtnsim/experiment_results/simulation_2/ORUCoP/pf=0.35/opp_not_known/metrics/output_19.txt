The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1905(1 to 12), 1920(6 to 3), 1950(8 to 2), 1958(4 to 5), 1981(2 to 4), 1982(9 to 10), 1983(12 to 11), 2004(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1905: 45.000000), (1920: 35.000000), (1981: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1905: 4), (1920: 6), (1950: 4), (1958: 4), (1981: 10), (1982: 4), (2004: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 175 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
