The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1960(1 to 12), 1977(6 to 3), 2009(8 to 2), 2018(4 to 5), 2037(2 to 4), 2038(9 to 10), 2039(12 to 11), 2045(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1960: 25.000000), (2038: 60.000000), (2045: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1960: 3), (1977: 6), (2009: 6), (2038: 6), (2045: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 164 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
