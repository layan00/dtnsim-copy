The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
661(1 to 12), 677(6 to 3), 709(8 to 2), 719(4 to 5), 744(2 to 4), 745(9 to 10), 746(12 to 11), 755(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(661: 25.000000), (677: 35.000000), (709: 60.000000), (755: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(661: 4), (677: 4), (709: 6), (719: 4), (744: 6), (745: 4), (755: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 215 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
