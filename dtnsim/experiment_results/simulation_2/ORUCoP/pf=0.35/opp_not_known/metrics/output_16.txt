The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
610(1 to 12), 625(6 to 3), 654(8 to 2), 660(4 to 5), 682(2 to 4), 683(9 to 10), 684(12 to 11), 696(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(610: 65.000000), (625: 35.000000), (654: 60.000000), (683: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(610: 2), (625: 5), (654: 6), (660: 6), (682: 4), (683: 6), (696: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 194 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
