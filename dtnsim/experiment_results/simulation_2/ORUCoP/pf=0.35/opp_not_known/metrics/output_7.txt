The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1094(1 to 12), 1110(6 to 3), 1140(8 to 2), 1146(4 to 5), 1168(2 to 4), 1169(9 to 10), 1170(12 to 11), 1180(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1094: 65.000000), (1110: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1094: 4), (1110: 5), (1140: 4), (1146: 4), (1169: 5), (1180: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 146 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
