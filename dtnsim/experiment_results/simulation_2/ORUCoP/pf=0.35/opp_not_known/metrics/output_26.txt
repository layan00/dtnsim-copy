The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
633(1 to 12), 647(6 to 3), 677(8 to 2), 684(4 to 5), 705(2 to 4), 706(9 to 10), 707(12 to 11), 718(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(633: 65.000000), (647: 35.000000), (677: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(633: 3), (647: 4), (677: 6), (706: 4), (707: 6), (718: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 221 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
