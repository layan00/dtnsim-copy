The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1028(1 to 12), 1042(6 to 3), 1070(8 to 2), 1075(4 to 5), 1100(2 to 4), 1101(9 to 10), 1102(12 to 11), 1127(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1028: 65.000000), (1042: 35.000000), (1075: 25.000000), (1100: 20.000000), (1101: 60.000000), (1127: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1028: 3), (1042: 10), (1070: 4), (1075: 9), (1100: 18), (1101: 10), (1102: 8), (1127: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 210 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
