The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1493(1 to 12), 1510(6 to 3), 1540(8 to 2), 1547(4 to 5), 1567(2 to 4), 1568(9 to 10), 1569(12 to 11), 1578(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1493: 45.000000), (1540: 60.000000), (1568: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1493: 3), (1510: 4), (1540: 6), (1547: 4), (1568: 6), (1578: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 152 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
