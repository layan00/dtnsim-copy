The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1110(1 to 12), 1127(6 to 3), 1156(8 to 2), 1162(4 to 5), 1183(2 to 4), 1184(9 to 10), 1185(12 to 11), 1196(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1110: 65.000000), (1127: 35.000000), (1156: 60.000000), (1184: 60.000000), (1185: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1110: 3), (1127: 4), (1156: 6), (1184: 6), (1185: 6), (1196: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 155 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
