The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1963(1 to 12), 1980(6 to 3), 2010(8 to 2), 2017(4 to 5), 2036(2 to 4), 2037(9 to 10), 2038(12 to 11), 2044(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1963: 25.000000), (1980: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1963: 3), (1980: 5), (2010: 4), (2037: 5), (2044: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 207 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
