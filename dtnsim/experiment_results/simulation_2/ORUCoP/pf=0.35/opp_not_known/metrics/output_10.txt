The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 12), 217(6 to 3), 247(8 to 2), 254(4 to 5), 275(2 to 4), 276(9 to 10), 277(12 to 11), 289(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 25.000000), (247: 60.000000), (277: 20.000000), (289: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 3), (217: 4), (247: 6), (275: 8), (276: 4), (277: 6), (289: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 188 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
