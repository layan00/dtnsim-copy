The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
630(1 to 12), 646(6 to 3), 677(8 to 2), 684(4 to 5), 705(2 to 4), 706(9 to 10), 707(12 to 11), 723(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(630: 65.000000), (677: 60.000000), (684: 5.000000), (707: 20.000000), (723: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(630: 5), (646: 4), (677: 6), (684: 8), (706: 5), (707: 6), (723: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 165 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
