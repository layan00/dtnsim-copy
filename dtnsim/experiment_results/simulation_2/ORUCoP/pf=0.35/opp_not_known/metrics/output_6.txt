The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
636(1 to 12), 652(6 to 3), 683(8 to 2), 692(4 to 5), 718(2 to 4), 719(9 to 10), 720(12 to 11), 741(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(636: 25.000000), (652: 35.000000), (683: 60.000000), (741: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 4), (652: 10), (683: 6), (692: 8), (718: 16), (719: 6), (720: 8), (741: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 229 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
