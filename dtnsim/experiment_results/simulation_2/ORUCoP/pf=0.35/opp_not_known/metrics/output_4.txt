The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1959(1 to 12), 1975(6 to 3), 2006(8 to 2), 2014(4 to 5), 2037(2 to 4), 2038(9 to 10), 2039(12 to 11), 2055(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1959: 65.000000), (1975: 35.000000), (2038: 60.000000), (2039: 20.000000), (2055: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1959: 5), (1975: 5), (2006: 4), (2014: 6), (2037: 4), (2038: 7), (2039: 7), (2055: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 220 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
