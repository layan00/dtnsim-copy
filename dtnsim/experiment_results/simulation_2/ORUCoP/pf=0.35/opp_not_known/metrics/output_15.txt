The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
197(1 to 12), 214(6 to 3), 245(8 to 2), 250(4 to 5), 267(2 to 4), 268(9 to 10), 269(12 to 11), 281(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(245: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(197: 1), (214: 4), (245: 6), (267: 6), (268: 5), (269: 5), (281: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 220 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
