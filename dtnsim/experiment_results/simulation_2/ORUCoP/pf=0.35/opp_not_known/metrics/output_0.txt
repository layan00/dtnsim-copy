The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 12), 233(6 to 3), 267(8 to 2), 275(4 to 5), 301(2 to 4), 302(9 to 10), 303(12 to 11), 333(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 45.000000), (301: 20.000000), (302: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 5), (233: 14), (267: 4), (275: 6), (301: 15), (302: 8), (303: 7), (333: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 309 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
