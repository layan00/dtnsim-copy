The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1489(1 to 12), 1506(6 to 3), 1534(8 to 2), 1540(4 to 5), 1558(2 to 4), 1559(9 to 10), 1560(12 to 11), 1567(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1489: 65.000000), (1506: 35.000000), (1534: 60.000000), (1559: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1489: 3), (1506: 5), (1534: 6), (1559: 10), (1567: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 156 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
