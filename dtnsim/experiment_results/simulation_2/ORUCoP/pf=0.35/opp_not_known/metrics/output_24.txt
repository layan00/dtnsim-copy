The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1949(1 to 12), 1967(6 to 3), 1998(8 to 2), 2007(4 to 5), 2030(2 to 4), 2031(9 to 10), 2032(12 to 11), 2046(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1949: 25.000000), (1998: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1949: 4), (1967: 6), (1998: 6), (2007: 2), (2030: 4), (2031: 6), (2032: 7), (2046: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 226 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
