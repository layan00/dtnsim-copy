The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 12), 230(6 to 3), 264(8 to 2), 272(4 to 5), 293(2 to 4), 294(9 to 10), 295(12 to 11), 324(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 25.000000), (264: 60.000000), (293: 20.000000), (294: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 3), (230: 13), (264: 6), (293: 15), (294: 8), (295: 6), (324: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 240 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
