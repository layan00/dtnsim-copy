The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
984(1 to 12), 997(6 to 3), 1023(8 to 2), 1028(4 to 5), 1043(2 to 4), 1044(9 to 10), 1045(12 to 11), 1047(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1045: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(984: 3), (997: 4), (1023: 3), (1028: 1), (1043: 1), (1044: 5), (1045: 5), (1047: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
