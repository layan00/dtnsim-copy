The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1377(1 to 12), 1390(6 to 3), 1416(8 to 2), 1422(4 to 5), 1439(2 to 4), 1440(9 to 10), 1441(12 to 11), 1443(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1390: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1377: 3), (1390: 4), (1416: 3), (1422: 1), (1439: 1), (1440: 5), (1441: 1), (1443: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
