The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
597(1 to 12), 610(6 to 3), 637(8 to 2), 642(4 to 5), 660(2 to 4), 661(9 to 10), 662(12 to 11), 666(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(637: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(597: 2), (610: 4), (637: 3), (642: 2), (660: 3), (661: 2), (662: 1), (666: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
