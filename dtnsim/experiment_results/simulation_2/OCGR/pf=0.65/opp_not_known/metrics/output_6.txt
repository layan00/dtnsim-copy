The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
597(1 to 12), 611(6 to 3), 639(8 to 2), 645(4 to 5), 662(2 to 4), 663(9 to 10), 664(12 to 11), 666(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(597: 65.000000), (666: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(597: 3), (611: 4), (639: 3), (645: 1), (662: 2), (663: 4), (664: 1), (666: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
