The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1813(1 to 12), 1828(6 to 3), 1857(8 to 2), 1864(4 to 5), 1879(2 to 4), 1880(9 to 10), 1881(12 to 11), 1882(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1813: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1813: 2), (1828: 4), (1857: 3), (1864: 1), (1879: 1), (1880: 4), (1881: 1), (1882: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
