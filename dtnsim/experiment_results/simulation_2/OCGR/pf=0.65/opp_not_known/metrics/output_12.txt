The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1007(1 to 12), 1021(6 to 3), 1047(8 to 2), 1052(4 to 5), 1070(2 to 4), 1071(9 to 10), 1072(12 to 11), 1076(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1071: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1007: 2), (1021: 4), (1047: 3), (1052: 1), (1070: 1), (1071: 4), (1072: 3), (1076: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
