The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1763(1 to 12), 1776(6 to 3), 1801(8 to 2), 1806(4 to 5), 1824(2 to 4), 1825(9 to 10), 1826(12 to 11), 1832(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1763: 3), (1776: 4), (1801: 3), (1806: 1), (1824: 7), (1825: 2), (1826: 1), (1832: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
