The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1380(1 to 12), 1394(6 to 3), 1420(8 to 2), 1426(4 to 5), 1442(2 to 4), 1443(9 to 10), 1444(12 to 11), 1449(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1394: 35.000000), (1420: 60.000000), (1443: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1380: 3), (1394: 4), (1420: 3), (1426: 1), (1442: 1), (1443: 7), (1444: 3), (1449: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
