The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
982(1 to 12), 997(6 to 3), 1027(8 to 2), 1031(4 to 5), 1048(2 to 4), 1049(9 to 10), 1050(12 to 11), 1052(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1027: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(982: 3), (997: 2), (1027: 3), (1031: 2), (1048: 1), (1049: 4), (1050: 5), (1052: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
