The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1776(1 to 12), 1790(6 to 3), 1818(8 to 2), 1823(4 to 5), 1841(2 to 4), 1842(9 to 10), 1843(12 to 11), 1845(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1790: 35.000000), (1818: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1776: 3), (1790: 4), (1818: 3), (1823: 2), (1841: 1), (1842: 4), (1843: 1), (1845: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
