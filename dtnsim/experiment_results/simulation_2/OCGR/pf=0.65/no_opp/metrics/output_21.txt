The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
170(1 to 12), 172(6 to 3), 177(8 to 2), 179(4 to 5), 185(2 to 4), 186(9 to 10), 187(12 to 11), 189(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(170: 3), (172: 2), (177: 1), (179: 1), (185: 2), (186: 1), (187: 1), (189: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
