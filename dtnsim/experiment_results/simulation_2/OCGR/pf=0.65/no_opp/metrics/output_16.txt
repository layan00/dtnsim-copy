The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
148(1 to 12), 149(6 to 3), 152(8 to 2), 153(4 to 5), 159(2 to 4), 160(9 to 10), 161(12 to 11), 166(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(148: 2), (149: 3), (152: 1), (153: 2), (159: 3), (160: 2), (161: 1), (166: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
