The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
315(1 to 12), 317(6 to 3), 320(8 to 2), 321(4 to 5), 326(2 to 4), 327(9 to 10), 328(12 to 11), 332(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(315: 2), (317: 2), (320: 2), (321: 3), (326: 1), (327: 2), (328: 1), (332: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
