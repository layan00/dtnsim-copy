The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
154(1 to 12), 155(6 to 3), 159(8 to 2), 160(4 to 5), 162(2 to 4), 163(9 to 10), 164(12 to 11), 166(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(166: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(154: 2), (155: 2), (159: 1), (160: 1), (162: 1), (163: 1), (164: 2), (166: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 154: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2:
