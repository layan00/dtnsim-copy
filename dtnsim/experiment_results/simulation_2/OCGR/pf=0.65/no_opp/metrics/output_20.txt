The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
69(1 to 12), 71(6 to 3), 79(8 to 2), 82(4 to 5), 87(2 to 4), 88(9 to 10), 89(12 to 11), 96(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(69: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(69: 2), (71: 2), (79: 4), (82: 1), (87: 1), (88: 2), (89: 3), (96: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
