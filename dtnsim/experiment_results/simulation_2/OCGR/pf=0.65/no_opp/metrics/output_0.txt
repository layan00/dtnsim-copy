The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
61(1 to 12), 63(6 to 3), 65(8 to 2), 66(4 to 5), 73(2 to 4), 74(9 to 10), 75(12 to 11), 82(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(74: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(61: 3), (63: 2), (65: 7), (66: 1), (73: 1), (74: 4), (75: 3), (82: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
