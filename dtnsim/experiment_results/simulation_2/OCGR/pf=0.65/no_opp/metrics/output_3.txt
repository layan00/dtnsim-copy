The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
310(1 to 12), 312(6 to 3), 316(8 to 2), 317(4 to 5), 318(2 to 4), 319(9 to 10), 320(12 to 11), 321(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(310: 2), (312: 2), (316: 1), (317: 1), (318: 1), (319: 1), (320: 1), (321: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 310: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 318: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 317: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 321: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 312: (to: 10, time: 20.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 316: (to: 12, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 319: (to: 5, time: 60.000000), 
Node 10:
