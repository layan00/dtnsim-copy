The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
396(1 to 12), 397(6 to 3), 398(8 to 2), 399(4 to 5), 405(2 to 4), 406(9 to 10), 407(12 to 11), 417(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(396: 3), (397: 5), (398: 2), (399: 1), (405: 7), (406: 2), (407: 1), (417: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
