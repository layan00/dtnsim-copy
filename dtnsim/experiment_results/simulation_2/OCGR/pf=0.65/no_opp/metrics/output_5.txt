The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
60(1 to 12), 62(6 to 3), 66(8 to 2), 67(4 to 5), 70(2 to 4), 71(9 to 10), 72(12 to 11), 75(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(71: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(60: 2), (62: 3), (66: 1), (67: 1), (70: 1), (71: 5), (72: 1), (75: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 60: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 71: (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 70: (to: 6, time: 60.000000),
