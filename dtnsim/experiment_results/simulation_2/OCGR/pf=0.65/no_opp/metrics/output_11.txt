The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
155(1 to 12), 158(6 to 3), 163(8 to 2), 164(4 to 5), 168(2 to 4), 169(9 to 10), 170(12 to 11), 176(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(155: 2), (158: 2), (163: 3), (164: 4), (168: 1), (169: 1), (170: 2), (176: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
