The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
148(1 to 12), 150(6 to 3), 154(8 to 2), 156(4 to 5), 161(2 to 4), 162(9 to 10), 163(12 to 11), 166(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(148: 65.000000), (166: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(148: 3), (150: 2), (154: 2), (156: 1), (161: 2), (162: 1), (163: 1), (166: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 148: (to: 5, time: 40.000000),
