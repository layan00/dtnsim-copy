The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(1 to 12), 239(6 to 3), 242(8 to 2), 243(4 to 5), 247(2 to 4), 248(9 to 10), 249(12 to 11), 252(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(237: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 3), (239: 2), (242: 2), (243: 1), (247: 1), (248: 2), (249: 1), (252: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 237: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
