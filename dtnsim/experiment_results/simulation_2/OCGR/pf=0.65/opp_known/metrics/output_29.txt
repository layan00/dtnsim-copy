The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1286(1 to 12), 1288(6 to 3), 1304(8 to 2), 1309(4 to 5), 1315(2 to 4), 1316(9 to 10), 1317(12 to 11), 1319(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1288: 35.000000), (1304: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1286: 3), (1288: 3), (1304: 3), (1309: 2), (1315: 1), (1316: 4), (1317: 1), (1319: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
