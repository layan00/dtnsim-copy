The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1316(1 to 12), 1319(6 to 3), 1336(8 to 2), 1343(4 to 5), 1346(2 to 4), 1347(9 to 10), 1348(12 to 11), 1349(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1316: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1316: 2), (1319: 3), (1336: 3), (1343: 1), (1346: 1), (1347: 4), (1348: 1), (1349: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
