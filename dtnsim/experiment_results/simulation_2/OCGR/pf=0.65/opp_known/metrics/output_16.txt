The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
465(1 to 12), 466(6 to 3), 481(8 to 2), 486(4 to 5), 492(2 to 4), 493(9 to 10), 494(12 to 11), 498(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(481: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(465: 2), (466: 3), (481: 3), (486: 2), (492: 3), (493: 2), (494: 1), (498: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
