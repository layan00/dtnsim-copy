The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
193(1 to 12), 195(6 to 3), 209(8 to 2), 214(4 to 5), 221(2 to 4), 222(9 to 10), 223(12 to 11), 228(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(195: 35.000000), (222: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(193: 3), (195: 3), (209: 3), (214: 1), (221: 1), (222: 4), (223: 3), (228: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
