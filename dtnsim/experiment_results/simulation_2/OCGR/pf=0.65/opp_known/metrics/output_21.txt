The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
484(1 to 12), 486(6 to 3), 503(8 to 2), 509(4 to 5), 515(2 to 4), 516(9 to 10), 517(12 to 11), 520(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(486: 35.000000), (503: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(484: 3), (486: 3), (503: 3), (509: 1), (515: 2), (516: 5), (517: 1), (520: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
