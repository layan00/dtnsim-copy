The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
737(1 to 12), 739(6 to 3), 754(8 to 2), 759(4 to 5), 763(2 to 4), 764(9 to 10), 765(12 to 11), 767(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(737: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(737: 3), (739: 3), (754: 3), (759: 1), (763: 1), (764: 2), (765: 1), (767: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 737: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
