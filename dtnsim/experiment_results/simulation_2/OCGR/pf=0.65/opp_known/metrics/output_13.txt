The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1034(1 to 12), 1038(6 to 3), 1055(8 to 2), 1061(4 to 5), 1067(2 to 4), 1068(9 to 10), 1069(12 to 11), 1074(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1061: 25.000000), (1069: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1034: 3), (1038: 3), (1055: 3), (1061: 6), (1067: 2), (1068: 4), (1069: 5), (1074: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
