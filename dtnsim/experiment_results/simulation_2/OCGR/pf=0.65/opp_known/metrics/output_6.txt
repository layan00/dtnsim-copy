The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
463(1 to 12), 465(6 to 3), 481(8 to 2), 487(4 to 5), 492(2 to 4), 493(9 to 10), 494(12 to 11), 496(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(463: 65.000000), (496: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(463: 3), (465: 3), (481: 3), (487: 1), (492: 2), (493: 4), (494: 1), (496: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
