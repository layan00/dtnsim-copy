The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1271(1 to 12), 1272(6 to 3), 1285(8 to 2), 1290(4 to 5), 1296(2 to 4), 1297(9 to 10), 1298(12 to 11), 1304(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1271: 3), (1272: 3), (1285: 3), (1290: 1), (1296: 7), (1297: 2), (1298: 1), (1304: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
