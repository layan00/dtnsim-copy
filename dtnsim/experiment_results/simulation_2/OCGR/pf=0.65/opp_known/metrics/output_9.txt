The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1277(1 to 12), 1281(6 to 3), 1295(8 to 2), 1300(4 to 5), 1304(2 to 4), 1305(9 to 10), 1306(12 to 11), 1309(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1281: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1277: 2), (1281: 3), (1295: 3), (1300: 1), (1304: 1), (1305: 2), (1306: 1), (1309: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
