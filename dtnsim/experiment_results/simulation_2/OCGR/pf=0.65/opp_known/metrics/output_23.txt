The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1038(1 to 12), 1039(6 to 3), 1055(8 to 2), 1061(4 to 5), 1065(2 to 4), 1066(9 to 10), 1067(12 to 11), 1069(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1038: 3), (1039: 3), (1055: 3), (1061: 1), (1065: 1), (1066: 2), (1067: 1), (1069: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
