The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1011(1 to 12), 1013(6 to 3), 1028(8 to 2), 1033(4 to 5), 1038(2 to 4), 1039(9 to 10), 1040(12 to 11), 1043(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1011: 2), (1013: 3), (1028: 3), (1033: 3), (1038: 1), (1039: 2), (1040: 1), (1043: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
