The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
471(1 to 12), 474(6 to 3), 491(8 to 2), 496(4 to 5), 500(2 to 4), 501(9 to 10), 502(12 to 11), 506(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(491: 60.000000), (496: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(471: 2), (474: 3), (491: 3), (496: 6), (500: 1), (501: 5), (502: 5), (506: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
