The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
999(1 to 12), 1001(6 to 3), 1017(8 to 2), 1022(4 to 5), 1023(2 to 4), 1024(9 to 10), 1025(12 to 11), 1026(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(999: 2), (1001: 3), (1017: 3), (1022: 1), (1023: 1), (1024: 4), (1025: 1), (1026: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
