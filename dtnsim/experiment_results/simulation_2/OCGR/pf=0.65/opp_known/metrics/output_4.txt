The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1264(1 to 12), 1265(6 to 3), 1282(8 to 2), 1288(4 to 5), 1291(2 to 4), 1292(9 to 10), 1293(12 to 11), 1295(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1264: 3), (1265: 3), (1282: 3), (1288: 1), (1291: 1), (1292: 4), (1293: 5), (1295: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
