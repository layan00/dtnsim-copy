The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
736(1 to 12), 737(6 to 3), 751(8 to 2), 756(4 to 5), 760(2 to 4), 761(9 to 10), 762(12 to 11), 763(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(736: 65.000000), (751: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(736: 3), (737: 3), (751: 3), (756: 1), (760: 1), (761: 4), (762: 1), (763: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
