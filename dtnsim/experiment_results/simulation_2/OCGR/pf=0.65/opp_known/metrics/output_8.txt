The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1006(1 to 12), 1008(6 to 3), 1022(8 to 2), 1028(4 to 5), 1032(2 to 4), 1033(9 to 10), 1034(12 to 11), 1039(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1008: 35.000000), (1022: 60.000000), (1033: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1006: 3), (1008: 3), (1022: 3), (1028: 1), (1032: 1), (1033: 5), (1034: 3), (1039: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
