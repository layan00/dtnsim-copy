The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
223(1 to 12), 238(6 to 3), 268(8 to 2), 275(4 to 5), 296(2 to 4), 297(9 to 10), 298(12 to 11), 304(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 25.000000), (238: 35.000000), (268: 60.000000), (298: 20.000000), (304: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(223: 2), (238: 4), (268: 3), (275: 1), (296: 2), (297: 3), (298: 3), (304: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
