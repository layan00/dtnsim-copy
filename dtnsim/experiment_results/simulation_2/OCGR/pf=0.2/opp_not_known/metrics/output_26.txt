The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
658(1 to 12), 672(6 to 3), 704(8 to 2), 709(4 to 5), 730(2 to 4), 731(9 to 10), 732(12 to 11), 740(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(658: 25.000000), (672: 55.000000), (704: 60.000000), (732: 20.000000), (740: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(658: 2), (672: 7), (704: 3), (709: 1), (730: 1), (731: 2), (732: 3), (740: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
