The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
648(1 to 12), 662(6 to 3), 692(8 to 2), 699(4 to 5), 719(2 to 4), 720(9 to 10), 721(12 to 11), 726(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(648: 25.000000), (662: 35.000000), (692: 60.000000), (726: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(648: 2), (662: 4), (692: 3), (699: 2), (719: 3), (720: 2), (721: 1), (726: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
