The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(1 to 12), 238(6 to 3), 269(8 to 2), 273(4 to 5), 295(2 to 4), 296(9 to 10), 297(12 to 11), 308(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(222: 65.000000), (238: 55.000000), (269: 60.000000), (273: 5.000000), (297: 20.000000), (308: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 3), (238: 7), (269: 3), (273: 4), (295: 1), (296: 2), (297: 3), (308: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
