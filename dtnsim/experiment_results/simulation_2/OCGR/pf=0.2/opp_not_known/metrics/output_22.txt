The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1097(1 to 12), 1112(6 to 3), 1143(8 to 2), 1147(4 to 5), 1169(2 to 4), 1170(9 to 10), 1171(12 to 11), 1179(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1097: 65.000000), (1143: 60.000000), (1170: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1097: 3), (1112: 3), (1143: 3), (1147: 2), (1169: 4), (1170: 4), (1171: 3), (1179: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
