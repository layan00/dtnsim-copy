The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1983(1 to 12), 1999(6 to 3), 2030(8 to 2), 2035(4 to 5), 2056(2 to 4), 2057(9 to 10), 2058(12 to 11), 2063(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1983: 25.000000), (2057: 60.000000), (2063: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1983: 2), (1999: 4), (2030: 3), (2035: 3), (2056: 1), (2057: 5), (2058: 1), (2063: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
