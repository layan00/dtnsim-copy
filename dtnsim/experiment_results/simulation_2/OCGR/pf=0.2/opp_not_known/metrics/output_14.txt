The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1972(1 to 12), 1988(6 to 3), 2020(8 to 2), 2025(4 to 5), 2046(2 to 4), 2047(9 to 10), 2048(12 to 11), 2056(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1972: 25.000000), (2020: 60.000000), (2046: 60.000000), (2056: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1972: 2), (1988: 4), (2020: 3), (2025: 3), (2046: 6), (2047: 4), (2048: 1), (2056: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
