The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
649(1 to 12), 665(6 to 3), 696(8 to 2), 700(4 to 5), 719(2 to 4), 720(9 to 10), 721(12 to 11), 732(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(649: 65.000000), (665: 55.000000), (696: 60.000000), (700: 5.000000), (721: 20.000000), (732: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(649: 3), (665: 7), (696: 3), (700: 4), (719: 1), (720: 3), (721: 3), (732: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
