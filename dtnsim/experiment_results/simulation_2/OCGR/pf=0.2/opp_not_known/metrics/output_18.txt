The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1517(1 to 12), 1532(6 to 3), 1560(8 to 2), 1566(4 to 5), 1586(2 to 4), 1587(9 to 10), 1588(12 to 11), 1595(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1517: 65.000000), (1532: 35.000000), (1560: 60.000000), (1586: 60.000000), (1587: 20.000000), (1595: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1517: 3), (1532: 4), (1560: 3), (1566: 1), (1586: 6), (1587: 4), (1588: 1), (1595: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
