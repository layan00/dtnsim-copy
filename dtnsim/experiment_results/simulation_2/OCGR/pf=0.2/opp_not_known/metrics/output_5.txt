The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 12), 240(6 to 3), 271(8 to 2), 276(4 to 5), 296(2 to 4), 297(9 to 10), 298(12 to 11), 302(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 25.000000), (271: 60.000000), (297: 20.000000), (302: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 2), (240: 4), (271: 3), (276: 1), (296: 1), (297: 4), (298: 1), (302: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
