The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1990(1 to 12), 2005(6 to 3), 2035(8 to 2), 2041(4 to 5), 2060(2 to 4), 2061(9 to 10), 2062(12 to 11), 2069(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1990: 65.000000), (2005: 35.000000), (2035: 60.000000), (2061: 20.000000), (2062: 20.000000), (2069: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1990: 3), (2005: 4), (2035: 3), (2041: 2), (2060: 3), (2061: 4), (2062: 3), (2069: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
