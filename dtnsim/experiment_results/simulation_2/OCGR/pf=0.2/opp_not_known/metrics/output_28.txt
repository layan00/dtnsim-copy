The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1541(1 to 12), 1556(6 to 3), 1586(8 to 2), 1591(4 to 5), 1611(2 to 4), 1612(9 to 10), 1613(12 to 11), 1617(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1586: 60.000000), (1612: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1541: 2), (1556: 4), (1586: 3), (1591: 3), (1611: 2), (1612: 4), (1613: 1), (1617: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
