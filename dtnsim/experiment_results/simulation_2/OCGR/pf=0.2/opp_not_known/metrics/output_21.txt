The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(1 to 12), 679(6 to 3), 710(8 to 2), 717(4 to 5), 739(2 to 4), 740(9 to 10), 741(12 to 11), 749(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(664: 25.000000), (679: 35.000000), (710: 60.000000), (740: 20.000000), (749: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(664: 2), (679: 4), (710: 3), (717: 3), (739: 7), (740: 4), (741: 1), (749: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
