The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(1 to 12), 216(6 to 3), 223(8 to 2), 226(4 to 5), 236(2 to 4), 237(9 to 10), 238(12 to 11), 253(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 25.000000), (253: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 2), (216: 6), (223: 3), (226: 4), (236: 6), (237: 1), (238: 2), (253: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
