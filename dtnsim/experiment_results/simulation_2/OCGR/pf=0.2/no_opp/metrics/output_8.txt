The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
490(1 to 12), 494(6 to 3), 502(8 to 2), 505(4 to 5), 515(2 to 4), 516(9 to 10), 517(12 to 11), 525(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(490: 25.000000), (516: 20.000000), (517: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(490: 2), (494: 3), (502: 1), (505: 2), (515: 4), (516: 4), (517: 3), (525: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
