The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
471(1 to 12), 474(6 to 3), 478(8 to 2), 480(4 to 5), 488(2 to 4), 489(9 to 10), 490(12 to 11), 500(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(471: 65.000000), (488: 60.000000), (489: 20.000000), (500: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(471: 3), (474: 5), (478: 2), (480: 1), (488: 6), (489: 4), (490: 1), (500: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
