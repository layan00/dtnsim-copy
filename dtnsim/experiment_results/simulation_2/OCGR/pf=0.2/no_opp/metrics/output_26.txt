The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 12), 216(6 to 3), 224(8 to 2), 227(4 to 5), 236(2 to 4), 237(9 to 10), 238(12 to 11), 249(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 25.000000), (216: 55.000000), (238: 20.000000), (249: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 2), (216: 7), (224: 4), (227: 1), (236: 1), (237: 2), (238: 3), (249: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
