The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
629(1 to 12), 633(6 to 3), 641(8 to 2), 644(4 to 5), 654(2 to 4), 655(9 to 10), 656(12 to 11), 664(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(629: 25.000000), (655: 60.000000), (656: 20.000000), (664: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(629: 2), (633: 3), (641: 1), (644: 2), (654: 4), (655: 5), (656: 3), (664: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
