The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 12), 207(6 to 3), 214(8 to 2), 216(4 to 5), 223(2 to 4), 224(9 to 10), 225(12 to 11), 239(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 65.000000), (207: 55.000000), (216: 5.000000), (225: 20.000000), (239: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 3), (207: 7), (214: 5), (216: 4), (223: 1), (224: 3), (225: 3), (239: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
