The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
629(1 to 12), 633(6 to 3), 641(8 to 2), 644(4 to 5), 653(2 to 4), 654(9 to 10), 655(12 to 11), 664(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(629: 25.000000), (653: 60.000000), (664: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(629: 2), (633: 4), (641: 2), (644: 3), (653: 6), (654: 1), (655: 1), (664: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
