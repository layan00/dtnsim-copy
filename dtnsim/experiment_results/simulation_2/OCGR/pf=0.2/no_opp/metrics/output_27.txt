The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
351(1 to 12), 354(6 to 3), 361(8 to 2), 363(4 to 5), 373(2 to 4), 374(9 to 10), 375(12 to 11), 395(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(361: 60.000000), (363: 5.000000), (373: 20.000000), (374: 20.000000), (375: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(351: 3), (354: 7), (361: 7), (363: 4), (373: 8), (374: 4), (375: 3), (395: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
