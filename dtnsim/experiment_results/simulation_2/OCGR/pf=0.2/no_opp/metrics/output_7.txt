The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
353(1 to 12), 357(6 to 3), 366(8 to 2), 369(4 to 5), 378(2 to 4), 379(9 to 10), 380(12 to 11), 386(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(353: 25.000000), (379: 20.000000), (386: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(353: 2), (357: 2), (366: 2), (369: 3), (378: 3), (379: 4), (380: 1), (386: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
