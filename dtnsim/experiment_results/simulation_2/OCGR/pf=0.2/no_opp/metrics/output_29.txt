The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
627(1 to 12), 631(6 to 3), 638(8 to 2), 639(4 to 5), 649(2 to 4), 650(9 to 10), 651(12 to 11), 659(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(650: 20.000000), (651: 20.000000), (659: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(627: 3), (631: 3), (638: 1), (639: 2), (649: 4), (650: 4), (651: 3), (659: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
