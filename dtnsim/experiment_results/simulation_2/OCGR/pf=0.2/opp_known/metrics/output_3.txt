The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1178(1 to 12), 1181(6 to 3), 1200(8 to 2), 1207(4 to 5), 1215(2 to 4), 1216(9 to 10), 1217(12 to 11), 1223(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1178: 25.000000), (1181: 35.000000), (1217: 20.000000), (1223: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1178: 2), (1181: 3), (1200: 3), (1207: 2), (1215: 2), (1216: 5), (1217: 3), (1223: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
