The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1471(1 to 12), 1475(6 to 3), 1494(8 to 2), 1501(4 to 5), 1510(2 to 4), 1511(9 to 10), 1512(12 to 11), 1519(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1471: 25.000000), (1475: 35.000000), (1494: 60.000000), (1510: 60.000000), (1519: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1471: 2), (1475: 3), (1494: 3), (1501: 3), (1510: 6), (1511: 4), (1512: 1), (1519: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
