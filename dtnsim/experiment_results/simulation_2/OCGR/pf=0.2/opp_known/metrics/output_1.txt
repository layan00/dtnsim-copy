The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
541(1 to 12), 545(6 to 3), 563(8 to 2), 568(4 to 5), 577(2 to 4), 578(9 to 10), 579(12 to 11), 588(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(545: 35.000000), (563: 60.000000), (568: 5.000000), (578: 20.000000), (579: 20.000000), (588: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(541: 2), (545: 3), (563: 3), (568: 4), (577: 2), (578: 4), (579: 3), (588: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
