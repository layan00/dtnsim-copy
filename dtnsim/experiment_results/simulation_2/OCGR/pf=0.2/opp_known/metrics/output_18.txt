The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1145(1 to 12), 1148(6 to 3), 1164(8 to 2), 1170(4 to 5), 1178(2 to 4), 1179(9 to 10), 1180(12 to 11), 1187(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1145: 65.000000), (1148: 35.000000), (1164: 60.000000), (1178: 60.000000), (1179: 20.000000), (1187: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1145: 3), (1148: 3), (1164: 3), (1170: 1), (1178: 6), (1179: 4), (1180: 1), (1187: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
