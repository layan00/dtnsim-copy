The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1181(1 to 12), 1185(6 to 3), 1204(8 to 2), 1211(4 to 5), 1221(2 to 4), 1222(9 to 10), 1223(12 to 11), 1231(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1181: 25.000000), (1185: 35.000000), (1204: 60.000000), (1222: 20.000000), (1223: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1181: 2), (1185: 3), (1204: 3), (1211: 2), (1221: 4), (1222: 4), (1223: 3), (1231: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
