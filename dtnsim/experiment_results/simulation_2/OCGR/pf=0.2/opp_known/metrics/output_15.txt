The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 12), 213(6 to 3), 232(8 to 2), 237(4 to 5), 244(2 to 4), 245(9 to 10), 246(12 to 11), 253(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(232: 60.000000), (246: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 2), (213: 3), (232: 3), (237: 2), (244: 4), (245: 3), (246: 3), (253: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
