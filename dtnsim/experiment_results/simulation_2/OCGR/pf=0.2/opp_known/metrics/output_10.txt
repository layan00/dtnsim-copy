The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(1 to 12), 214(6 to 3), 232(8 to 2), 239(4 to 5), 248(2 to 4), 249(9 to 10), 250(12 to 11), 256(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(211: 25.000000), (214: 35.000000), (232: 60.000000), (250: 20.000000), (256: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(211: 2), (214: 3), (232: 3), (239: 1), (248: 2), (249: 3), (250: 3), (256: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
