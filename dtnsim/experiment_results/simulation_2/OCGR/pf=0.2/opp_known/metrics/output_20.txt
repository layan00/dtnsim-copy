The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 12), 218(6 to 3), 237(8 to 2), 244(4 to 5), 253(2 to 4), 254(9 to 10), 255(12 to 11), 266(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 25.000000), (218: 35.000000), (237: 60.000000), (253: 20.000000), (254: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 2), (218: 3), (237: 3), (244: 1), (253: 8), (254: 4), (255: 3), (266: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
