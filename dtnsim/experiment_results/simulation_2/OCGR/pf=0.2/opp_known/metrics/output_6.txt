The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(1 to 12), 530(6 to 3), 549(8 to 2), 556(4 to 5), 566(2 to 4), 567(9 to 10), 568(12 to 11), 578(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 25.000000), (530: 35.000000), (549: 60.000000), (556: 25.000000), (566: 20.000000), (567: 20.000000), (568: 20.000000), (578: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 2), (530: 3), (549: 3), (556: 6), (566: 10), (567: 6), (568: 5), (578: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
