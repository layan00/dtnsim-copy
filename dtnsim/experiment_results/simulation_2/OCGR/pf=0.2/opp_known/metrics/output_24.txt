The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1479(1 to 12), 1483(6 to 3), 1502(8 to 2), 1509(4 to 5), 1519(2 to 4), 1520(9 to 10), 1521(12 to 11), 1529(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1479: 25.000000), (1483: 35.000000), (1502: 60.000000), (1520: 60.000000), (1521: 20.000000), (1529: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1479: 2), (1483: 3), (1502: 3), (1509: 2), (1519: 4), (1520: 5), (1521: 3), (1529: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
