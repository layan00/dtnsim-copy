The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1158(1 to 12), 1161(6 to 3), 1179(8 to 2), 1184(4 to 5), 1192(2 to 4), 1193(9 to 10), 1194(12 to 11), 1198(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1179: 60.000000), (1193: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1158: 2), (1161: 3), (1179: 3), (1184: 3), (1192: 2), (1193: 4), (1194: 1), (1198: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
