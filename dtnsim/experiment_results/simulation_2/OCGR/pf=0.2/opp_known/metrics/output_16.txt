The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
516(1 to 12), 518(6 to 3), 536(8 to 2), 543(4 to 5), 551(2 to 4), 552(9 to 10), 553(12 to 11), 558(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(516: 25.000000), (518: 35.000000), (536: 60.000000), (558: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(516: 2), (518: 3), (536: 3), (543: 2), (551: 3), (552: 2), (553: 1), (558: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
