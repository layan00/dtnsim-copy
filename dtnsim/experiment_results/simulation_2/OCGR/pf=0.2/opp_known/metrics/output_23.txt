The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1156(1 to 12), 1158(6 to 3), 1177(8 to 2), 1184(4 to 5), 1193(2 to 4), 1194(9 to 10), 1195(12 to 11), 1203(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1156: 25.000000), (1184: 5.000000), (1194: 20.000000), (1195: 20.000000), (1203: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1156: 2), (1158: 3), (1177: 3), (1184: 4), (1193: 2), (1194: 4), (1195: 3), (1203: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
