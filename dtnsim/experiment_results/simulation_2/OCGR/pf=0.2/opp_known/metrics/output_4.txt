The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1489(1 to 12), 1492(6 to 3), 1510(8 to 2), 1516(4 to 5), 1523(2 to 4), 1524(9 to 10), 1525(12 to 11), 1532(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1489: 65.000000), (1492: 35.000000), (1510: 60.000000), (1524: 20.000000), (1525: 20.000000), (1532: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1489: 3), (1492: 3), (1510: 3), (1516: 2), (1523: 3), (1524: 4), (1525: 3), (1532: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
