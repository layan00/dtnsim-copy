The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
826(1 to 12), 829(6 to 3), 846(8 to 2), 852(4 to 5), 861(2 to 4), 862(9 to 10), 863(12 to 11), 870(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(829: 35.000000), (846: 60.000000), (862: 20.000000), (863: 20.000000), (870: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(826: 3), (829: 3), (846: 3), (852: 1), (861: 3), (862: 4), (863: 3), (870: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
