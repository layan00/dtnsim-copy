The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
861(1 to 12), 865(6 to 3), 885(8 to 2), 892(4 to 5), 901(2 to 4), 902(9 to 10), 903(12 to 11), 909(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(861: 25.000000), (865: 35.000000), (902: 20.000000), (909: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(861: 2), (865: 3), (885: 3), (892: 3), (901: 3), (902: 4), (903: 1), (909: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
