The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
517(1 to 12), 521(6 to 3), 539(8 to 2), 545(4 to 5), 552(2 to 4), 553(9 to 10), 554(12 to 11), 561(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 65.000000), (539: 60.000000), (545: 5.000000), (554: 20.000000), (561: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(517: 3), (521: 3), (539: 3), (545: 4), (552: 1), (553: 3), (554: 3), (561: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
