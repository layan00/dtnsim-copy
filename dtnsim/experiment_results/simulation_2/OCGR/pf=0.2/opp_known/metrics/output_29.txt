The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1468(1 to 12), 1472(6 to 3), 1490(8 to 2), 1495(4 to 5), 1505(2 to 4), 1506(9 to 10), 1507(12 to 11), 1515(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1472: 35.000000), (1490: 60.000000), (1506: 20.000000), (1507: 20.000000), (1515: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1468: 3), (1472: 3), (1490: 3), (1495: 2), (1505: 4), (1506: 4), (1507: 3), (1515: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
