The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 12), 214(6 to 3), 232(8 to 2), 238(4 to 5), 248(2 to 4), 249(9 to 10), 250(12 to 11), 258(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 65.000000), (214: 35.000000), (232: 60.000000), (238: 5.000000), (250: 20.000000), (258: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 3), (214: 3), (232: 3), (238: 4), (248: 1), (249: 2), (250: 3), (258: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
