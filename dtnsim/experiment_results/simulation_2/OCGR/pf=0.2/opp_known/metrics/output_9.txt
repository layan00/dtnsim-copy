The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1494(1 to 12), 1498(6 to 3), 1516(8 to 2), 1523(4 to 5), 1532(2 to 4), 1533(9 to 10), 1534(12 to 11), 1538(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1494: 25.000000), (1498: 35.000000), (1533: 60.000000), (1538: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1494: 2), (1498: 3), (1516: 3), (1523: 3), (1532: 1), (1533: 5), (1534: 1), (1538: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
