The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
843(1 to 12), 846(6 to 3), 864(8 to 2), 870(4 to 5), 880(2 to 4), 881(9 to 10), 882(12 to 11), 890(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(843: 65.000000), (846: 35.000000), (864: 60.000000), (881: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(843: 3), (846: 3), (864: 3), (870: 2), (880: 4), (881: 4), (882: 3), (890: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
