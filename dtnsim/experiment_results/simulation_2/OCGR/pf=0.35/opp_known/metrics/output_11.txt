The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
502(1 to 12), 505(6 to 3), 523(8 to 2), 529(4 to 5), 535(2 to 4), 536(9 to 10), 537(12 to 11), 544(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(502: 65.000000), (523: 60.000000), (529: 5.000000), (537: 20.000000), (544: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(502: 3), (505: 3), (523: 3), (529: 4), (535: 1), (536: 3), (537: 3), (544: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
