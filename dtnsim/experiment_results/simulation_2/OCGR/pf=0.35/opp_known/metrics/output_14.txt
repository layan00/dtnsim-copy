The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1420(1 to 12), 1423(6 to 3), 1440(8 to 2), 1447(4 to 5), 1453(2 to 4), 1454(9 to 10), 1455(12 to 11), 1457(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1420: 25.000000), (1423: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1420: 2), (1423: 3), (1440: 3), (1447: 1), (1453: 1), (1454: 4), (1455: 1), (1457: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
