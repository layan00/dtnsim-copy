The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1127(1 to 12), 1129(6 to 3), 1147(8 to 2), 1152(4 to 5), 1157(2 to 4), 1158(9 to 10), 1159(12 to 11), 1163(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1129: 35.000000), (1163: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1127: 2), (1129: 3), (1147: 3), (1152: 2), (1157: 2), (1158: 5), (1159: 1), (1163: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
