The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1423(1 to 12), 1425(6 to 3), 1443(8 to 2), 1449(4 to 5), 1456(2 to 4), 1457(9 to 10), 1458(12 to 11), 1465(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1423: 65.000000), (1425: 35.000000), (1457: 60.000000), (1458: 20.000000), (1465: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1423: 3), (1425: 3), (1443: 3), (1449: 2), (1456: 3), (1457: 5), (1458: 3), (1465: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
