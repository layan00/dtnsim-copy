The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
799(1 to 12), 802(6 to 3), 820(8 to 2), 826(4 to 5), 833(2 to 4), 834(9 to 10), 835(12 to 11), 840(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(802: 35.000000), (820: 60.000000), (834: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(799: 3), (802: 3), (820: 3), (826: 2), (833: 1), (834: 4), (835: 3), (840: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
