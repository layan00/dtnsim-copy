The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1384(1 to 12), 1386(6 to 3), 1403(8 to 2), 1408(4 to 5), 1417(2 to 4), 1418(9 to 10), 1419(12 to 11), 1427(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1386: 35.000000), (1417: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1384: 3), (1386: 3), (1403: 3), (1408: 3), (1417: 6), (1418: 2), (1419: 1), (1427: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
