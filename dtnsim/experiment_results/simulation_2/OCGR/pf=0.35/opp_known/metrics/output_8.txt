The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1124(1 to 12), 1128(6 to 3), 1146(8 to 2), 1153(4 to 5), 1161(2 to 4), 1162(9 to 10), 1163(12 to 11), 1171(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1124: 25.000000), (1128: 35.000000), (1146: 60.000000), (1162: 20.000000), (1163: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1124: 2), (1128: 3), (1146: 3), (1153: 2), (1161: 4), (1162: 4), (1163: 3), (1171: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
