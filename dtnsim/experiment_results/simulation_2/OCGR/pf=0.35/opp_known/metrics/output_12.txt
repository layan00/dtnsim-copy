The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
805(1 to 12), 808(6 to 3), 824(8 to 2), 829(4 to 5), 838(2 to 4), 839(9 to 10), 840(12 to 11), 847(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(808: 35.000000), (839: 20.000000), (840: 20.000000), (847: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(805: 2), (808: 3), (824: 3), (829: 1), (838: 3), (839: 4), (840: 3), (847: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
