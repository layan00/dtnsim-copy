The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
501(1 to 12), 502(6 to 3), 519(8 to 2), 525(4 to 5), 533(2 to 4), 534(9 to 10), 535(12 to 11), 540(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(501: 65.000000), (502: 35.000000), (519: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(501: 3), (502: 3), (519: 3), (525: 1), (533: 1), (534: 2), (535: 3), (540: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
