The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1100(1 to 12), 1103(6 to 3), 1120(8 to 2), 1125(4 to 5), 1131(2 to 4), 1132(9 to 10), 1133(12 to 11), 1136(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1120: 60.000000), (1132: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1100: 2), (1103: 3), (1120: 3), (1125: 3), (1131: 1), (1132: 4), (1133: 1), (1136: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
