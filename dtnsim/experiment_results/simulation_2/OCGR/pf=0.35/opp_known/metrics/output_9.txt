The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1428(1 to 12), 1432(6 to 3), 1449(8 to 2), 1456(4 to 5), 1462(2 to 4), 1463(9 to 10), 1464(12 to 11), 1467(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1428: 25.000000), (1432: 35.000000), (1467: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1428: 2), (1432: 3), (1449: 3), (1456: 1), (1462: 1), (1463: 2), (1464: 1), (1467: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
