The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
518(1 to 12), 521(6 to 3), 540(8 to 2), 547(4 to 5), 556(2 to 4), 557(9 to 10), 558(12 to 11), 563(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(518: 25.000000), (521: 35.000000), (540: 60.000000), (563: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(518: 2), (521: 3), (540: 3), (547: 3), (556: 2), (557: 3), (558: 1), (563: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
