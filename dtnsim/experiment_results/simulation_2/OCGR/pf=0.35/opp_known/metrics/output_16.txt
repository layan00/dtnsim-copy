The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
487(1 to 12), 489(6 to 3), 505(8 to 2), 511(4 to 5), 518(2 to 4), 519(9 to 10), 520(12 to 11), 525(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(487: 65.000000), (489: 35.000000), (505: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(487: 3), (489: 3), (505: 3), (511: 2), (518: 3), (519: 2), (520: 1), (525: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
