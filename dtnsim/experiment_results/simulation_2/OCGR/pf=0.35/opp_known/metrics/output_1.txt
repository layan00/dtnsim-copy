The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(1 to 12), 531(6 to 3), 548(8 to 2), 553(4 to 5), 558(2 to 4), 559(9 to 10), 560(12 to 11), 563(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(531: 35.000000), (548: 60.000000), (559: 20.000000), (560: 20.000000), (563: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 2), (531: 3), (548: 3), (553: 2), (558: 1), (559: 6), (560: 5), (563: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
