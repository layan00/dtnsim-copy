The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(1 to 12), 207(6 to 3), 224(8 to 2), 229(4 to 5), 238(2 to 4), 239(9 to 10), 240(12 to 11), 248(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 35.000000), (224: 60.000000), (229: 5.000000), (240: 20.000000), (248: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 2), (207: 3), (224: 3), (229: 4), (238: 1), (239: 2), (240: 3), (248: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
