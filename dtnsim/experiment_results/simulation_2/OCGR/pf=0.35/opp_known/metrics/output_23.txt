The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1113(1 to 12), 1115(6 to 3), 1133(8 to 2), 1140(4 to 5), 1147(2 to 4), 1148(9 to 10), 1149(12 to 11), 1153(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1113: 25.000000), (1148: 20.000000), (1153: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1113: 2), (1115: 3), (1133: 3), (1140: 3), (1147: 2), (1148: 4), (1149: 1), (1153: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
