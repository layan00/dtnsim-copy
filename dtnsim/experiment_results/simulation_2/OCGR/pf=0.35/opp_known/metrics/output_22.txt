The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
813(1 to 12), 816(6 to 3), 834(8 to 2), 840(4 to 5), 849(2 to 4), 850(9 to 10), 851(12 to 11), 857(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(813: 65.000000), (816: 35.000000), (850: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(813: 3), (816: 3), (834: 3), (840: 2), (849: 2), (850: 5), (851: 3), (857: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
