The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1083(1 to 12), 1098(6 to 3), 1126(8 to 2), 1132(4 to 5), 1152(2 to 4), 1153(9 to 10), 1154(12 to 11), 1159(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1083: 65.000000), (1098: 35.000000), (1126: 60.000000), (1154: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1083: 3), (1098: 4), (1126: 3), (1132: 1), (1152: 1), (1153: 3), (1154: 3), (1159: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
