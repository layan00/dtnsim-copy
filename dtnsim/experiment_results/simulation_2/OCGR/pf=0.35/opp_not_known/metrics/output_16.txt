The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
619(1 to 12), 633(6 to 3), 661(8 to 2), 667(4 to 5), 686(2 to 4), 687(9 to 10), 688(12 to 11), 693(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(619: 65.000000), (633: 35.000000), (661: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(619: 3), (633: 4), (661: 3), (667: 2), (686: 3), (687: 2), (688: 1), (693: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
