The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
634(1 to 12), 649(6 to 3), 679(8 to 2), 685(4 to 5), 703(2 to 4), 704(9 to 10), 705(12 to 11), 712(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(634: 65.000000), (679: 60.000000), (685: 5.000000), (705: 20.000000), (712: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(634: 3), (649: 4), (679: 3), (685: 4), (703: 1), (704: 3), (705: 3), (712: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
