The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
633(1 to 12), 646(6 to 3), 675(8 to 2), 681(4 to 5), 701(2 to 4), 702(9 to 10), 703(12 to 11), 708(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(633: 65.000000), (646: 35.000000), (675: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(633: 3), (646: 4), (675: 3), (681: 1), (701: 1), (702: 2), (703: 3), (708: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
