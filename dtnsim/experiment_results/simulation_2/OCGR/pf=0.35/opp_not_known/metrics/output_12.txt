The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1057(1 to 12), 1072(6 to 3), 1100(8 to 2), 1105(4 to 5), 1126(2 to 4), 1127(9 to 10), 1128(12 to 11), 1135(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1072: 35.000000), (1127: 20.000000), (1128: 20.000000), (1135: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1057: 2), (1072: 4), (1100: 3), (1105: 1), (1126: 3), (1127: 4), (1128: 3), (1135: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
