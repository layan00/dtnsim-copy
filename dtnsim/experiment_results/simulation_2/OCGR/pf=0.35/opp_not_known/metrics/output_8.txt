The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1500(1 to 12), 1516(6 to 3), 1547(8 to 2), 1552(4 to 5), 1572(2 to 4), 1573(9 to 10), 1574(12 to 11), 1582(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1500: 25.000000), (1547: 60.000000), (1573: 20.000000), (1574: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1500: 2), (1516: 3), (1547: 3), (1552: 2), (1572: 4), (1573: 4), (1574: 3), (1582: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
