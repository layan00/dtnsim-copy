The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1917(1 to 12), 1932(6 to 3), 1961(8 to 2), 1968(4 to 5), 1986(2 to 4), 1987(9 to 10), 1988(12 to 11), 1990(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1917: 25.000000), (1932: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1917: 2), (1932: 4), (1961: 3), (1968: 1), (1986: 1), (1987: 4), (1988: 1), (1990: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
