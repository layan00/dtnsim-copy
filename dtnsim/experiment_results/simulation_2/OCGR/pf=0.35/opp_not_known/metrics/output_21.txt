The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
652(1 to 12), 667(6 to 3), 698(8 to 2), 705(4 to 5), 726(2 to 4), 727(9 to 10), 728(12 to 11), 733(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(652: 25.000000), (667: 35.000000), (698: 60.000000), (733: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(652: 2), (667: 4), (698: 3), (705: 3), (726: 2), (727: 3), (728: 1), (733: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
