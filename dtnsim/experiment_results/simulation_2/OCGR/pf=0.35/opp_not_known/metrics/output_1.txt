The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
661(1 to 12), 677(6 to 3), 707(8 to 2), 710(4 to 5), 727(2 to 4), 728(9 to 10), 729(12 to 11), 731(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(707: 60.000000), (728: 20.000000), (729: 20.000000), (731: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(661: 2), (677: 2), (707: 3), (710: 2), (727: 1), (728: 6), (729: 5), (731: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
