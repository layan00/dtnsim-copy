The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 12), 240(6 to 3), 272(8 to 2), 276(4 to 5), 298(2 to 4), 299(9 to 10), 300(12 to 11), 317(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(276: 5.000000), (298: 20.000000), (299: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 3), (240: 6), (272: 3), (276: 4), (298: 8), (299: 4), (300: 3), (317: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
