The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1488(1 to 12), 1502(6 to 3), 1532(8 to 2), 1539(4 to 5), 1558(2 to 4), 1559(9 to 10), 1560(12 to 11), 1564(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1488: 25.000000), (1559: 20.000000), (1564: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1488: 2), (1502: 4), (1532: 3), (1539: 3), (1558: 2), (1559: 4), (1560: 1), (1564: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
