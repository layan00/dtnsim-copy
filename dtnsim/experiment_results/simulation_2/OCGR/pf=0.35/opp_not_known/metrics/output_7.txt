The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1075(1 to 12), 1090(6 to 3), 1119(8 to 2), 1125(4 to 5), 1144(2 to 4), 1145(9 to 10), 1146(12 to 11), 1150(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1075: 65.000000), (1090: 35.000000), (1145: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1075: 3), (1090: 4), (1119: 3), (1125: 3), (1144: 1), (1145: 7), (1146: 1), (1150: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
