The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1923(1 to 12), 1939(6 to 3), 1969(8 to 2), 1974(4 to 5), 1992(2 to 4), 1993(9 to 10), 1994(12 to 11), 1996(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1923: 25.000000), (1996: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1923: 2), (1939: 2), (1969: 3), (1974: 1), (1992: 1), (1993: 2), (1994: 1), (1996: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
