The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1878(1 to 12), 1892(6 to 3), 1921(8 to 2), 1926(4 to 5), 1947(2 to 4), 1948(9 to 10), 1949(12 to 11), 1957(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1892: 35.000000), (1947: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1878: 3), (1892: 4), (1921: 3), (1926: 3), (1947: 6), (1948: 2), (1949: 1), (1957: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
