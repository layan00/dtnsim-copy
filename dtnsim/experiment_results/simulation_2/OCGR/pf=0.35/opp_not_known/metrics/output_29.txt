The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1886(1 to 12), 1901(6 to 3), 1930(8 to 2), 1935(4 to 5), 1955(2 to 4), 1956(9 to 10), 1957(12 to 11), 1962(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1901: 35.000000), (1930: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1886: 3), (1901: 4), (1930: 3), (1935: 2), (1955: 1), (1956: 3), (1957: 3), (1962: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
