The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
638(1 to 12), 652(6 to 3), 682(8 to 2), 689(4 to 5), 711(2 to 4), 712(9 to 10), 713(12 to 11), 723(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(638: 25.000000), (652: 35.000000), (682: 60.000000), (689: 25.000000), (713: 20.000000), (723: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(638: 2), (652: 4), (682: 3), (689: 6), (711: 10), (712: 5), (713: 5), (723: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
