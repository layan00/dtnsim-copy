The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1470(1 to 12), 1485(6 to 3), 1514(8 to 2), 1519(4 to 5), 1537(2 to 4), 1538(9 to 10), 1539(12 to 11), 1542(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1514: 60.000000), (1538: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1470: 2), (1485: 4), (1514: 3), (1519: 3), (1537: 1), (1538: 4), (1539: 1), (1542: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
