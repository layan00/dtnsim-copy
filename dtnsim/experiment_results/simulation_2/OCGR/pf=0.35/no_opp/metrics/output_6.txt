The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
192(1 to 12), 194(6 to 3), 200(8 to 2), 203(4 to 5), 213(2 to 4), 214(9 to 10), 215(12 to 11), 230(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(192: 25.000000), (230: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(192: 2), (194: 6), (200: 3), (203: 4), (213: 6), (214: 1), (215: 2), (230: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
