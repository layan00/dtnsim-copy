The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
78(1 to 12), 82(6 to 3), 90(8 to 2), 93(4 to 5), 101(2 to 4), 102(9 to 10), 103(12 to 11), 120(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(78: 25.000000), (90: 60.000000), (101: 20.000000), (102: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 2), (82: 6), (90: 7), (93: 1), (101: 8), (102: 4), (103: 3), (120: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
