The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
322(1 to 12), 325(6 to 3), 332(8 to 2), 334(4 to 5), 343(2 to 4), 344(9 to 10), 345(12 to 11), 351(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(322: 65.000000), (344: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(322: 3), (325: 3), (332: 1), (334: 2), (343: 2), (344: 5), (345: 3), (351: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
