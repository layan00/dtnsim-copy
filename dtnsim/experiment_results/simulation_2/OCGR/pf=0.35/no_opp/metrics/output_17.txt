The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
275(1 to 12), 276(6 to 3), 279(8 to 2), 280(4 to 5), 290(2 to 4), 291(9 to 10), 292(12 to 11), 307(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(275: 65.000000), (307: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(275: 3), (276: 6), (279: 3), (280: 4), (290: 6), (291: 1), (292: 2), (307: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
