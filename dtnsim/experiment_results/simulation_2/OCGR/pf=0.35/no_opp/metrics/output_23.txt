The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
439(1 to 12), 441(6 to 3), 447(8 to 2), 450(4 to 5), 457(2 to 4), 458(9 to 10), 459(12 to 11), 464(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(439: 25.000000), (458: 20.000000), (464: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(439: 2), (441: 2), (447: 2), (450: 3), (457: 2), (458: 4), (459: 1), (464: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
