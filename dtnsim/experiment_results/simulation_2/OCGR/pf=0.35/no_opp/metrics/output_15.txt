The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(1 to 12), 73(6 to 3), 79(8 to 2), 80(4 to 5), 84(2 to 4), 85(9 to 10), 86(12 to 11), 91(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 2), (73: 2), (79: 1), (80: 1), (84: 2), (85: 3), (86: 3), (91: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 70: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
