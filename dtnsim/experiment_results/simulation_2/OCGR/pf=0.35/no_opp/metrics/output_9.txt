The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
557(1 to 12), 561(6 to 3), 567(8 to 2), 570(4 to 5), 576(2 to 4), 577(9 to 10), 578(12 to 11), 580(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(557: 25.000000), (580: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(557: 2), (561: 2), (567: 1), (570: 1), (576: 1), (577: 2), (578: 1), (580: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
