The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
73(1 to 12), 75(6 to 3), 80(8 to 2), 81(4 to 5), 90(2 to 4), 91(9 to 10), 92(12 to 11), 107(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(75: 55.000000), (81: 5.000000), (92: 20.000000), (107: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(73: 2), (75: 8), (80: 4), (81: 4), (90: 1), (91: 2), (92: 3), (107: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
