The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
193(1 to 12), 194(6 to 3), 199(8 to 2), 201(4 to 5), 209(2 to 4), 210(9 to 10), 211(12 to 11), 218(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(193: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(193: 3), (194: 2), (199: 4), (201: 1), (209: 1), (210: 2), (211: 3), (218: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
