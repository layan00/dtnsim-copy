The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
311(1 to 12), 314(6 to 3), 318(8 to 2), 319(4 to 5), 328(2 to 4), 329(9 to 10), 330(12 to 11), 340(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(329: 20.000000), (330: 20.000000), (340: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(311: 2), (314: 3), (318: 7), (319: 1), (328: 3), (329: 4), (330: 3), (340: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
