The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 12), 215(6 to 3), 222(8 to 2), 225(4 to 5), 234(2 to 4), 235(9 to 10), 236(12 to 11), 241(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 25.000000), (241: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 2), (215: 2), (222: 2), (225: 3), (234: 2), (235: 3), (236: 1), (241: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
