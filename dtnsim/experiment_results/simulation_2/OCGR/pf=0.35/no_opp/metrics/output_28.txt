The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
424(1 to 12), 427(6 to 3), 432(8 to 2), 433(4 to 5), 439(2 to 4), 440(9 to 10), 441(12 to 11), 445(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(440: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(424: 2), (427: 2), (432: 2), (433: 3), (439: 1), (440: 4), (441: 1), (445: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
