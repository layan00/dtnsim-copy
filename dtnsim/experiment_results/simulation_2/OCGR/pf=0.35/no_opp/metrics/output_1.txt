The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(1 to 12), 225(6 to 3), 231(8 to 2), 232(4 to 5), 237(2 to 4), 238(9 to 10), 239(12 to 11), 241(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 2), (225: 2), (231: 1), (232: 2), (237: 1), (238: 1), (239: 2), (241: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 221: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
