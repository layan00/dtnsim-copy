The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
694(1 to 12), 697(6 to 3), 712(8 to 2), 717(4 to 5), 720(2 to 4), 721(9 to 10), 722(12 to 11), 724(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(712: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(694: 2), (697: 3), (712: 3), (717: 1), (720: 1), (721: 4), (722: 5), (724: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
