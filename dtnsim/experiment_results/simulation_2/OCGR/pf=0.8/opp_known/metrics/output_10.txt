The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
187(1 to 12), 188(6 to 3), 202(8 to 2), 207(4 to 5), 210(2 to 4), 211(9 to 10), 212(12 to 11), 214(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(187: 2), (188: 3), (202: 3), (207: 1), (210: 1), (211: 3), (212: 1), (214: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
