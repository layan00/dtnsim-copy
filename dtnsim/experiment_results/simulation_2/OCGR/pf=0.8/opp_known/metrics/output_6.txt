The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
452(1 to 12), 453(6 to 3), 469(8 to 2), 475(4 to 5), 479(2 to 4), 480(9 to 10), 481(12 to 11), 483(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(483: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(452: 3), (453: 3), (469: 3), (475: 1), (479: 2), (480: 4), (481: 1), (483: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
