The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
972(1 to 12), 974(6 to 3), 990(8 to 2), 996(4 to 5), 998(2 to 4), 999(9 to 10), 1000(12 to 11), 1002(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(972: 3), (974: 3), (990: 3), (996: 1), (998: 1), (999: 4), (1000: 5), (1002: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
