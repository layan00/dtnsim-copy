The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
454(1 to 12), 455(6 to 3), 469(8 to 2), 474(4 to 5), 476(2 to 4), 477(9 to 10), 478(12 to 11), 480(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(455: 35.000000), (469: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(454: 2), (455: 3), (469: 3), (474: 1), (476: 1), (477: 5), (478: 1), (480: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
