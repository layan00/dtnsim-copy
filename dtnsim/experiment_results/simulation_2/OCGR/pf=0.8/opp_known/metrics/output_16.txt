The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
449(1 to 12), 450(6 to 3), 464(8 to 2), 469(4 to 5), 471(2 to 4), 472(9 to 10), 473(12 to 11), 474(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(449: 2), (450: 3), (464: 3), (469: 2), (471: 1), (472: 4), (473: 1), (474: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
