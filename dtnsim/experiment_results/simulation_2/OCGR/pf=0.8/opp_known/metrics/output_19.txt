The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1220(1 to 12), 1221(6 to 3), 1234(8 to 2), 1239(4 to 5), 1242(2 to 4), 1243(9 to 10), 1244(12 to 11), 1245(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1220: 2), (1221: 3), (1234: 3), (1239: 1), (1242: 1), (1243: 4), (1244: 1), (1245: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
