The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
974(1 to 12), 976(6 to 3), 990(8 to 2), 996(4 to 5), 999(2 to 4), 1000(9 to 10), 1001(12 to 11), 1004(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(976: 35.000000), (1000: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(974: 3), (976: 3), (990: 3), (996: 1), (999: 1), (1000: 5), (1001: 1), (1004: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
