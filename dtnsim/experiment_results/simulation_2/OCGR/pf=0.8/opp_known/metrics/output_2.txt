The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
710(1 to 12), 711(6 to 3), 725(8 to 2), 730(4 to 5), 734(2 to 4), 735(9 to 10), 736(12 to 11), 737(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(710: 3), (711: 3), (725: 3), (730: 1), (734: 1), (735: 4), (736: 1), (737: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
