The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
452(1 to 12), 453(6 to 3), 469(8 to 2), 474(4 to 5), 476(2 to 4), 477(9 to 10), 478(12 to 11), 480(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(452: 2), (453: 3), (469: 3), (474: 1), (476: 1), (477: 5), (478: 5), (480: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
