The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
712(1 to 12), 713(6 to 3), 727(8 to 2), 732(4 to 5), 736(2 to 4), 737(9 to 10), 738(12 to 11), 742(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(712: 2), (713: 3), (727: 3), (732: 1), (736: 1), (737: 2), (738: 3), (742: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
