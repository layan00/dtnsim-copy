The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1231(1 to 12), 1232(6 to 3), 1246(8 to 2), 1252(4 to 5), 1256(2 to 4), 1257(9 to 10), 1258(12 to 11), 1262(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1231: 3), (1232: 3), (1246: 3), (1252: 1), (1256: 1), (1257: 3), (1258: 3), (1262: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
