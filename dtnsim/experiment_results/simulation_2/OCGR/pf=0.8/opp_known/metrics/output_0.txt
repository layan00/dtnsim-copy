The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(1 to 12), 191(6 to 3), 205(8 to 2), 210(4 to 5), 216(2 to 4), 217(9 to 10), 218(12 to 11), 223(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(191: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 3), (191: 3), (205: 3), (210: 1), (216: 1), (217: 3), (218: 3), (223: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
