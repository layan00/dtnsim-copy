The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
954(1 to 12), 967(6 to 3), 993(8 to 2), 998(4 to 5), 1012(2 to 4), 1013(9 to 10), 1014(12 to 11), 1016(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(954: 3), (967: 4), (993: 3), (998: 1), (1012: 1), (1013: 5), (1014: 5), (1016: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
