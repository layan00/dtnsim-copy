The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(1 to 12), 214(6 to 3), 242(8 to 2), 247(4 to 5), 260(2 to 4), 261(9 to 10), 262(12 to 11), 263(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 2), (214: 4), (242: 3), (247: 1), (260: 1), (261: 9), (262: 1), (263: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
