The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
204(1 to 12), 217(6 to 3), 245(8 to 2), 250(4 to 5), 266(2 to 4), 267(9 to 10), 268(12 to 11), 273(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(245: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(204: 2), (217: 4), (245: 3), (250: 1), (266: 2), (267: 3), (268: 3), (273: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
