The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
946(1 to 12), 961(6 to 3), 989(8 to 2), 992(4 to 5), 1007(2 to 4), 1008(9 to 10), 1009(12 to 11), 1011(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(989: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(946: 2), (961: 2), (989: 3), (992: 1), (1007: 1), (1008: 4), (1009: 5), (1011: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
