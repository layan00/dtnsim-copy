The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1710(1 to 12), 1723(6 to 3), 1751(8 to 2), 1757(4 to 5), 1772(2 to 4), 1773(9 to 10), 1774(12 to 11), 1776(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1710: 3), (1723: 4), (1751: 3), (1757: 1), (1772: 1), (1773: 4), (1774: 5), (1776: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
