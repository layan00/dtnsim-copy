The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1725(1 to 12), 1740(6 to 3), 1767(8 to 2), 1773(4 to 5), 1787(2 to 4), 1788(9 to 10), 1789(12 to 11), 1790(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1725: 3), (1740: 4), (1767: 3), (1773: 1), (1787: 1), (1788: 4), (1789: 1), (1790: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
