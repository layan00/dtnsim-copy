The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1712(1 to 12), 1725(6 to 3), 1750(8 to 2), 1755(4 to 5), 1770(2 to 4), 1771(9 to 10), 1772(12 to 11), 1773(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1712: 2), (1725: 4), (1750: 3), (1755: 1), (1770: 1), (1771: 4), (1772: 1), (1773: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
