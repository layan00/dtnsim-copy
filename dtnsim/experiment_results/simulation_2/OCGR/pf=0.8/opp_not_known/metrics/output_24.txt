The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1720(1 to 12), 1733(6 to 3), 1759(8 to 2), 1765(4 to 5), 1781(2 to 4), 1782(9 to 10), 1783(12 to 11), 1787(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1720: 3), (1733: 4), (1759: 3), (1765: 1), (1781: 1), (1782: 3), (1783: 3), (1787: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
