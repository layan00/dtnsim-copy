The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
962(1 to 12), 975(6 to 3), 1001(8 to 2), 1006(4 to 5), 1022(2 to 4), 1023(9 to 10), 1024(12 to 11), 1025(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(962: 3), (975: 4), (1001: 3), (1006: 1), (1022: 1), (1023: 4), (1024: 1), (1025: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
