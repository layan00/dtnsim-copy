The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
577(1 to 12), 591(6 to 3), 617(8 to 2), 622(4 to 5), 637(2 to 4), 638(9 to 10), 639(12 to 11), 641(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(617: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(577: 2), (591: 4), (617: 3), (622: 2), (637: 1), (638: 5), (639: 5), (641: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
