The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
584(1 to 12), 597(6 to 3), 625(8 to 2), 630(4 to 5), 644(2 to 4), 645(9 to 10), 646(12 to 11), 648(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(584: 2), (597: 4), (625: 3), (630: 1), (644: 1), (645: 5), (646: 5), (648: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
