The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
340(1 to 12), 341(6 to 3), 342(8 to 2), 343(4 to 5), 346(2 to 4), 347(9 to 10), 348(12 to 11), 350(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(340: 2), (341: 2), (342: 2), (343: 1), (346: 1), (347: 1), (348: 1), (350: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 340: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2:
