The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
275(1 to 12), 277(6 to 3), 280(8 to 2), 281(4 to 5), 282(2 to 4), 283(9 to 10), 284(12 to 11), 285(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(275: 2), (277: 2), (280: 1), (281: 1), (282: 1), (283: 1), (284: 1), (285: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 275: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 282: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 281: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 285: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 277: (to: 10, time: 20.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 280: (to: 12, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9:
