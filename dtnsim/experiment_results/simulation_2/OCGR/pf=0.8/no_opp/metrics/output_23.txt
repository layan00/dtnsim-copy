The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
286(1 to 12), 287(6 to 3), 288(8 to 2), 289(4 to 5), 292(2 to 4), 293(9 to 10), 294(12 to 11), 296(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(286: 2), (287: 2), (288: 1), (289: 1), (292: 1), (293: 2), (294: 1), (296: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 286: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2:
