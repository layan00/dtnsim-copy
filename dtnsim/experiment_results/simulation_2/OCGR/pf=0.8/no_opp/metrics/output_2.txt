The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(1 to 12), 209(6 to 3), 211(8 to 2), 212(4 to 5), 216(2 to 4), 217(9 to 10), 218(12 to 11), 220(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 3), (209: 2), (211: 2), (212: 1), (216: 1), (217: 1), (218: 1), (220: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 208: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
