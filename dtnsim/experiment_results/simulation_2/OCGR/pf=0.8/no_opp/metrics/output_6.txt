The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
131(1 to 12), 132(6 to 3), 136(8 to 2), 138(4 to 5), 142(2 to 4), 143(9 to 10), 144(12 to 11), 146(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(146: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(131: 3), (132: 2), (136: 1), (138: 1), (142: 2), (143: 1), (144: 1), (146: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 131: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 142: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 138: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5:
