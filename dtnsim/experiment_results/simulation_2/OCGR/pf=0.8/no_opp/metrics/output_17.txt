The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
199(1 to 12), 200(6 to 3), 202(8 to 2), 203(4 to 5), 205(2 to 4), 206(9 to 10), 207(12 to 11), 209(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(199: 3), (200: 2), (202: 1), (203: 1), (205: 1), (206: 1), (207: 2), (209: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 199: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2:
