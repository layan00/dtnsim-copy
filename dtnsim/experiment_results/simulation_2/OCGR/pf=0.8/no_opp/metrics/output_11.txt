The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
129(1 to 12), 131(6 to 3), 133(8 to 2), 134(4 to 5), 137(2 to 4), 138(9 to 10), 139(12 to 11), 141(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(129: 2), (131: 2), (133: 1), (134: 2), (137: 1), (138: 1), (139: 2), (141: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 129: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
