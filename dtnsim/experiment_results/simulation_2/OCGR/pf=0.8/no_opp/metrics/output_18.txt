The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
271(1 to 12), 272(6 to 3), 274(8 to 2), 276(4 to 5), 279(2 to 4), 280(9 to 10), 281(12 to 11), 282(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(271: 3), (272: 2), (274: 1), (276: 1), (279: 1), (280: 1), (281: 1), (282: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 271: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 279: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 276: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5:
