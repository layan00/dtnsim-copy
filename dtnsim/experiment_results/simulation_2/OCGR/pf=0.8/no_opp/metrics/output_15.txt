The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
60(1 to 12), 61(6 to 3), 65(8 to 2), 66(4 to 5), 70(2 to 4), 71(9 to 10), 72(12 to 11), 77(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(60: 2), (61: 2), (65: 1), (66: 1), (70: 2), (71: 3), (72: 3), (77: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 60: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
