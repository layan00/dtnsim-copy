The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
282(1 to 12), 284(6 to 3), 286(8 to 2), 288(4 to 5), 291(2 to 4), 292(9 to 10), 293(12 to 11), 295(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(292: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(282: 3), (284: 2), (286: 1), (288: 1), (291: 1), (292: 5), (293: 1), (295: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
