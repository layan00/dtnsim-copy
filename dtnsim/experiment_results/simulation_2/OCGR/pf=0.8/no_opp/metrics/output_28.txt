The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
271(1 to 12), 273(6 to 3), 276(8 to 2), 277(4 to 5), 281(2 to 4), 282(9 to 10), 283(12 to 11), 286(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(271: 2), (273: 2), (276: 2), (277: 3), (281: 1), (282: 1), (283: 1), (286: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
