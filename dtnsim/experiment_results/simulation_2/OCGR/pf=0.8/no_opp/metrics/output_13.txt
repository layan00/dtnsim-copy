The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
283(1 to 12), 285(6 to 3), 289(8 to 2), 291(4 to 5), 293(2 to 4), 294(9 to 10), 295(12 to 11), 297(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(283: 3), (285: 2), (289: 1), (291: 1), (293: 1), (294: 1), (295: 2), (297: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 283: (to: 5, time: 40.000000),
