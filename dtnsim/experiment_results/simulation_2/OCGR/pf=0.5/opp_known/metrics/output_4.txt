The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1338(1 to 12), 1339(6 to 3), 1356(8 to 2), 1362(4 to 5), 1367(2 to 4), 1368(9 to 10), 1369(12 to 11), 1375(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1368: 60.000000), (1369: 20.000000), (1375: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1338: 3), (1339: 3), (1356: 3), (1362: 1), (1367: 3), (1368: 5), (1369: 3), (1375: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
