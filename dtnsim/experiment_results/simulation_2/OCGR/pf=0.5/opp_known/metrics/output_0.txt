The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
204(1 to 12), 206(6 to 3), 224(8 to 2), 230(4 to 5), 238(2 to 4), 239(9 to 10), 240(12 to 11), 246(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 35.000000), (239: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(204: 3), (206: 3), (224: 3), (230: 1), (238: 2), (239: 4), (240: 3), (246: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
