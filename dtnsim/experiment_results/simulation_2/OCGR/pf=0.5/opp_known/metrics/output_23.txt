The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1069(1 to 12), 1071(6 to 3), 1088(8 to 2), 1095(4 to 5), 1099(2 to 4), 1100(9 to 10), 1101(12 to 11), 1103(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1069: 25.000000), (1100: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1069: 2), (1071: 3), (1088: 3), (1095: 1), (1099: 1), (1100: 4), (1101: 1), (1103: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
