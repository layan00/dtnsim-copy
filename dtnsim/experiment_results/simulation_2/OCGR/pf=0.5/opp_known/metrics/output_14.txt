The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1379(1 to 12), 1382(6 to 3), 1399(8 to 2), 1406(4 to 5), 1411(2 to 4), 1412(9 to 10), 1413(12 to 11), 1414(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1379: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1379: 2), (1382: 3), (1399: 3), (1406: 1), (1411: 1), (1412: 4), (1413: 1), (1414: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
