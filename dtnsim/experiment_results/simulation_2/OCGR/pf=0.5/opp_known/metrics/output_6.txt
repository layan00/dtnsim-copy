The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(1 to 12), 483(6 to 3), 501(8 to 2), 508(4 to 5), 516(2 to 4), 517(9 to 10), 518(12 to 11), 524(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(481: 25.000000), (501: 60.000000), (508: 25.000000), (518: 20.000000), (524: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 2), (483: 3), (501: 3), (508: 6), (516: 3), (517: 4), (518: 5), (524: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
