The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
783(1 to 12), 785(6 to 3), 802(8 to 2), 807(4 to 5), 816(2 to 4), 817(9 to 10), 818(12 to 11), 824(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(785: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(783: 3), (785: 3), (802: 3), (807: 2), (816: 2), (817: 3), (818: 3), (824: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
