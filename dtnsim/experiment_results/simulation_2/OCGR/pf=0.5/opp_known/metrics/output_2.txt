The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
776(1 to 12), 777(6 to 3), 792(8 to 2), 798(4 to 5), 805(2 to 4), 806(9 to 10), 807(12 to 11), 811(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(776: 65.000000), (792: 60.000000), (807: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(776: 3), (777: 3), (792: 3), (798: 1), (805: 1), (806: 2), (807: 3), (811: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
