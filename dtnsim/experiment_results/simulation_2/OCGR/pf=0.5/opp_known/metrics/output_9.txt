The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1338(1 to 12), 1342(6 to 3), 1356(8 to 2), 1361(4 to 5), 1366(2 to 4), 1367(9 to 10), 1368(12 to 11), 1371(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1342: 35.000000), (1371: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1338: 2), (1342: 3), (1356: 3), (1361: 1), (1366: 1), (1367: 2), (1368: 1), (1371: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
