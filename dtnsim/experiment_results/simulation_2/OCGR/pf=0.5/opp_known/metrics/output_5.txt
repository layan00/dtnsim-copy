The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
197(1 to 12), 199(6 to 3), 215(8 to 2), 220(4 to 5), 226(2 to 4), 227(9 to 10), 228(12 to 11), 230(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(197: 2), (199: 3), (215: 3), (220: 1), (226: 1), (227: 5), (228: 1), (230: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
