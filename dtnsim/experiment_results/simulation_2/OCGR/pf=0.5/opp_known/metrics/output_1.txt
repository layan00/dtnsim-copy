The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
489(1 to 12), 490(6 to 3), 507(8 to 2), 512(4 to 5), 516(2 to 4), 517(9 to 10), 518(12 to 11), 521(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(490: 35.000000), (517: 60.000000), (518: 20.000000), (521: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(489: 2), (490: 3), (507: 3), (512: 2), (516: 1), (517: 7), (518: 5), (521: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
