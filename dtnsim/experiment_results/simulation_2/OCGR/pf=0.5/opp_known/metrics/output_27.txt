The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
766(1 to 12), 769(6 to 3), 786(8 to 2), 792(4 to 5), 797(2 to 4), 798(9 to 10), 799(12 to 11), 802(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(769: 35.000000), (786: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(766: 3), (769: 3), (786: 3), (792: 2), (797: 1), (798: 4), (799: 5), (802: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
