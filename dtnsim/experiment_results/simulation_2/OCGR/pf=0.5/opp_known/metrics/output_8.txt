The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1057(1 to 12), 1060(6 to 3), 1076(8 to 2), 1083(4 to 5), 1087(2 to 4), 1088(9 to 10), 1089(12 to 11), 1094(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1057: 25.000000), (1060: 35.000000), (1076: 60.000000), (1088: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1057: 2), (1060: 3), (1076: 3), (1083: 1), (1087: 1), (1088: 4), (1089: 3), (1094: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
