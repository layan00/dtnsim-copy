The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1049(1 to 12), 1052(6 to 3), 1066(8 to 2), 1072(4 to 5), 1077(2 to 4), 1078(9 to 10), 1079(12 to 11), 1081(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1049: 65.000000), (1052: 35.000000), (1078: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1049: 3), (1052: 3), (1066: 3), (1072: 1), (1077: 1), (1078: 7), (1079: 1), (1081: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
