The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
777(1 to 12), 779(6 to 3), 794(8 to 2), 799(4 to 5), 804(2 to 4), 805(9 to 10), 806(12 to 11), 808(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(777: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(777: 3), (779: 3), (794: 3), (799: 1), (804: 1), (805: 2), (806: 1), (808: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 777: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
