The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
784(1 to 12), 786(6 to 3), 801(8 to 2), 806(4 to 5), 813(2 to 4), 814(9 to 10), 815(12 to 11), 819(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(814: 20.000000), (815: 20.000000), (819: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(784: 2), (786: 3), (801: 3), (806: 1), (813: 1), (814: 4), (815: 3), (819: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
