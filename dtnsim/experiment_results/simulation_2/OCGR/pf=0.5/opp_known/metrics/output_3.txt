The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1055(1 to 12), 1057(6 to 3), 1074(8 to 2), 1079(4 to 5), 1081(2 to 4), 1082(9 to 10), 1083(12 to 11), 1085(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1057: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1055: 2), (1057: 3), (1074: 3), (1079: 1), (1081: 1), (1082: 7), (1083: 1), (1085: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
