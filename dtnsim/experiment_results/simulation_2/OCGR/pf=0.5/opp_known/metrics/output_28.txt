The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1054(1 to 12), 1057(6 to 3), 1072(8 to 2), 1077(4 to 5), 1082(2 to 4), 1083(9 to 10), 1084(12 to 11), 1087(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1054: 2), (1057: 3), (1072: 3), (1077: 3), (1082: 1), (1083: 2), (1084: 1), (1087: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
