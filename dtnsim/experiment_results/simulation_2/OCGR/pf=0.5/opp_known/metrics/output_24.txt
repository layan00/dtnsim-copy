The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1356(1 to 12), 1359(6 to 3), 1374(8 to 2), 1381(4 to 5), 1389(2 to 4), 1390(9 to 10), 1391(12 to 11), 1398(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1356: 25.000000), (1359: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1356: 2), (1359: 3), (1374: 3), (1381: 1), (1389: 3), (1390: 5), (1391: 3), (1398: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
