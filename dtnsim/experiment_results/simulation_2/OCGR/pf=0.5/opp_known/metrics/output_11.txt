The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
492(1 to 12), 495(6 to 3), 512(8 to 2), 517(4 to 5), 522(2 to 4), 523(9 to 10), 524(12 to 11), 531(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(512: 60.000000), (517: 5.000000), (524: 20.000000), (531: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(492: 2), (495: 3), (512: 3), (517: 4), (522: 1), (523: 3), (524: 3), (531: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
