The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
391(1 to 12), 393(6 to 3), 398(8 to 2), 401(4 to 5), 405(2 to 4), 406(9 to 10), 407(12 to 11), 410(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(391: 25.000000), (406: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(391: 2), (393: 2), (398: 2), (401: 1), (405: 1), (406: 4), (407: 1), (410: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 391: (to: 5, time: 40.000000),
