The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
72(1 to 12), 74(6 to 3), 80(8 to 2), 82(4 to 5), 90(2 to 4), 91(9 to 10), 92(12 to 11), 100(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(91: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(72: 3), (74: 2), (80: 7), (82: 1), (90: 2), (91: 4), (92: 3), (100: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
