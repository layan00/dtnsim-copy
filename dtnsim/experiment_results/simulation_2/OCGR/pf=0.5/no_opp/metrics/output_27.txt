The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
258(1 to 12), 261(6 to 3), 267(8 to 2), 269(4 to 5), 274(2 to 4), 275(9 to 10), 276(12 to 11), 278(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(258: 3), (261: 2), (267: 1), (269: 2), (274: 1), (275: 1), (276: 2), (278: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
