The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
470(1 to 12), 474(6 to 3), 477(8 to 2), 478(4 to 5), 483(2 to 4), 484(9 to 10), 485(12 to 11), 487(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(487: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(470: 2), (474: 2), (477: 1), (478: 1), (483: 1), (484: 2), (485: 1), (487: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 470: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2:

Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 478: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 484: (to: 1, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 487: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 474: (to: 10, time: 20.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 477: (to: 12, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9:
