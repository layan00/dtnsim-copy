The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
75(1 to 12), 78(6 to 3), 86(8 to 2), 89(4 to 5), 96(2 to 4), 97(9 to 10), 98(12 to 11), 110(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(75: 25.000000), (86: 60.000000), (97: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(75: 2), (78: 6), (86: 7), (89: 1), (96: 2), (97: 4), (98: 3), (110: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
