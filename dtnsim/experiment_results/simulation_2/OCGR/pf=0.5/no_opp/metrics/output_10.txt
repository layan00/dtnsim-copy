The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(1 to 12), 72(6 to 3), 76(8 to 2), 79(4 to 5), 87(2 to 4), 88(9 to 10), 89(12 to 11), 97(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(70: 25.000000), (89: 20.000000), (97: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 2), (72: 2), (76: 5), (79: 1), (87: 2), (88: 3), (89: 3), (97: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
