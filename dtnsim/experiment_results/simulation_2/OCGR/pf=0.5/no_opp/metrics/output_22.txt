The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
288(1 to 12), 290(6 to 3), 296(8 to 2), 297(4 to 5), 306(2 to 4), 307(9 to 10), 308(12 to 11), 314(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(288: 3), (290: 3), (296: 1), (297: 2), (306: 2), (307: 3), (308: 3), (314: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
