The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
290(1 to 12), 292(6 to 3), 295(8 to 2), 296(4 to 5), 303(2 to 4), 304(9 to 10), 305(12 to 11), 313(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(304: 20.000000), (305: 20.000000), (313: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(290: 2), (292: 3), (295: 7), (296: 1), (303: 1), (304: 4), (305: 3), (313: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
