The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
272(1 to 12), 273(6 to 3), 276(8 to 2), 278(4 to 5), 285(2 to 4), 286(9 to 10), 287(12 to 11), 294(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(272: 65.000000), (287: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(272: 3), (273: 2), (276: 4), (278: 1), (285: 1), (286: 2), (287: 3), (294: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
