The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(1 to 12), 197(6 to 3), 203(8 to 2), 205(4 to 5), 212(2 to 4), 213(9 to 10), 214(12 to 11), 216(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 3), (197: 2), (203: 1), (205: 2), (212: 2), (213: 1), (214: 1), (216: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
