The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
178(1 to 12), 179(6 to 3), 184(8 to 2), 185(4 to 5), 189(2 to 4), 190(9 to 10), 191(12 to 11), 193(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(193: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(178: 2), (179: 2), (184: 1), (185: 2), (189: 1), (190: 1), (191: 2), (193: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 178: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 189: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 185: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 193: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 179: (to: 10, time: 20.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 184: (to: 12, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 185: (to: 12, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9:
