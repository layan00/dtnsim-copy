The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
158(1 to 12), 159(6 to 3), 164(8 to 2), 166(4 to 5), 172(2 to 4), 173(9 to 10), 174(12 to 11), 178(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(158: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(158: 3), (159: 2), (164: 3), (166: 1), (172: 1), (173: 1), (174: 2), (178: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 158: (to: 5, time: 40.000000),
