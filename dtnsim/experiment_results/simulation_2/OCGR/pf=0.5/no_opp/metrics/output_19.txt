The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
456(1 to 12), 457(6 to 3), 460(8 to 2), 461(4 to 5), 469(2 to 4), 470(9 to 10), 471(12 to 11), 482(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(469: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(456: 3), (457: 5), (460: 2), (461: 3), (469: 6), (470: 2), (471: 1), (482: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
