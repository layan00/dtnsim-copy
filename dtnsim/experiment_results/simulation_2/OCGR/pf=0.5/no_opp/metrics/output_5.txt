The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
65(1 to 12), 67(6 to 3), 71(8 to 2), 72(4 to 5), 78(2 to 4), 79(9 to 10), 80(12 to 11), 86(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(79: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(65: 2), (67: 5), (71: 2), (72: 1), (78: 1), (79: 5), (80: 1), (86: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
