The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
63(1 to 12), 65(6 to 3), 68(8 to 2), 69(4 to 5), 74(2 to 4), 75(9 to 10), 76(12 to 11), 81(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(63: 2), (65: 3), (68: 3), (69: 1), (74: 1), (75: 1), (76: 2), (81: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
