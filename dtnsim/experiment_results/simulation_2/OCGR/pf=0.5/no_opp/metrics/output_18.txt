The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
361(1 to 12), 364(6 to 3), 366(8 to 2), 368(4 to 5), 373(2 to 4), 374(9 to 10), 375(12 to 11), 378(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(361: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(361: 3), (364: 4), (366: 1), (368: 1), (373: 1), (374: 1), (375: 1), (378: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 361: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 373: (to: 6, time: 60.000000),
