The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1010(1 to 12), 1023(6 to 3), 1049(8 to 2), 1054(4 to 5), 1073(2 to 4), 1074(9 to 10), 1075(12 to 11), 1078(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1023: 35.000000), (1074: 60.000000), (1075: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1010: 3), (1023: 4), (1049: 3), (1054: 1), (1073: 1), (1074: 7), (1075: 5), (1078: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
