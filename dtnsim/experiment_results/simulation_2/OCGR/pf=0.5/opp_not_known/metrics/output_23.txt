The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1442(1 to 12), 1456(6 to 3), 1485(8 to 2), 1492(4 to 5), 1508(2 to 4), 1509(9 to 10), 1510(12 to 11), 1512(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1442: 25.000000), (1509: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1442: 2), (1456: 4), (1485: 3), (1492: 1), (1508: 1), (1509: 4), (1510: 1), (1512: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
