The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1849(1 to 12), 1864(6 to 3), 1892(8 to 2), 1897(4 to 5), 1917(2 to 4), 1918(9 to 10), 1919(12 to 11), 1925(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1849: 25.000000), (1918: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1849: 2), (1864: 2), (1892: 3), (1897: 1), (1917: 3), (1918: 7), (1919: 3), (1925: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
