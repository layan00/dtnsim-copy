The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1036(1 to 12), 1050(6 to 3), 1077(8 to 2), 1082(4 to 5), 1101(2 to 4), 1102(9 to 10), 1103(12 to 11), 1107(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1102: 20.000000), (1103: 20.000000), (1107: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1036: 2), (1050: 4), (1077: 3), (1082: 1), (1101: 1), (1102: 4), (1103: 3), (1107: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
