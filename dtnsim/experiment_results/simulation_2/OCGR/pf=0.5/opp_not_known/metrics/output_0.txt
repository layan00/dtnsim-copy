The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(1 to 12), 230(6 to 3), 260(8 to 2), 266(4 to 5), 286(2 to 4), 287(9 to 10), 288(12 to 11), 294(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(230: 35.000000), (287: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 3), (230: 4), (260: 3), (266: 1), (286: 2), (287: 4), (288: 3), (294: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
