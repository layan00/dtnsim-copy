The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1835(1 to 12), 1848(6 to 3), 1877(8 to 2), 1883(4 to 5), 1900(2 to 4), 1901(9 to 10), 1902(12 to 11), 1908(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1901: 60.000000), (1902: 20.000000), (1908: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1835: 3), (1848: 4), (1877: 3), (1883: 1), (1900: 3), (1901: 7), (1902: 3), (1908: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
