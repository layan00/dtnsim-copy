The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1018(1 to 12), 1033(6 to 3), 1063(8 to 2), 1067(4 to 5), 1084(2 to 4), 1085(9 to 10), 1086(12 to 11), 1088(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1063: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1018: 3), (1033: 2), (1063: 3), (1067: 2), (1084: 1), (1085: 4), (1086: 5), (1088: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
