The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
207(1 to 12), 221(6 to 3), 248(8 to 2), 253(4 to 5), 270(2 to 4), 271(9 to 10), 272(12 to 11), 275(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 35.000000), (248: 60.000000), (272: 20.000000), (275: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(207: 2), (221: 4), (248: 3), (253: 1), (270: 1), (271: 4), (272: 5), (275: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
