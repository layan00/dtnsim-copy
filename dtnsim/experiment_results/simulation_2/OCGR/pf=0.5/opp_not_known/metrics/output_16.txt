The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
611(1 to 12), 625(6 to 3), 653(8 to 2), 659(4 to 5), 677(2 to 4), 678(9 to 10), 679(12 to 11), 683(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(653: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(611: 3), (625: 4), (653: 3), (659: 2), (677: 3), (678: 2), (679: 1), (683: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
