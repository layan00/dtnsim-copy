The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
219(1 to 12), 234(6 to 3), 266(8 to 2), 271(4 to 5), 290(2 to 4), 291(9 to 10), 292(12 to 11), 301(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 25.000000), (266: 60.000000), (291: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(219: 2), (234: 6), (266: 3), (271: 1), (290: 2), (291: 4), (292: 3), (301: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
