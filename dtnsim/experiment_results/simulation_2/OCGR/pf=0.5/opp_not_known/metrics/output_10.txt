The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 12), 228(6 to 3), 256(8 to 2), 263(4 to 5), 283(2 to 4), 284(9 to 10), 285(12 to 11), 290(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 25.000000), (256: 60.000000), (285: 20.000000), (290: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 2), (228: 4), (256: 3), (263: 1), (283: 2), (284: 3), (285: 3), (290: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
