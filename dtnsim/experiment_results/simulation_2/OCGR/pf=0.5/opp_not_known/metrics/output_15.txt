The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 12), 227(6 to 3), 256(8 to 2), 261(4 to 5), 277(2 to 4), 278(9 to 10), 279(12 to 11), 284(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(256: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 2), (227: 4), (256: 3), (261: 1), (277: 2), (278: 3), (279: 3), (284: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
