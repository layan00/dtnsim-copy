The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
610(1 to 12), 623(6 to 3), 652(8 to 2), 658(4 to 5), 676(2 to 4), 677(9 to 10), 678(12 to 11), 681(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(610: 65.000000), (623: 35.000000), (652: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(610: 3), (623: 4), (652: 3), (658: 1), (676: 1), (677: 4), (678: 5), (681: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
