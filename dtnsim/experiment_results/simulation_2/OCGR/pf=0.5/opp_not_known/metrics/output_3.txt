The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1429(1 to 12), 1443(6 to 3), 1472(8 to 2), 1477(4 to 5), 1491(2 to 4), 1492(9 to 10), 1493(12 to 11), 1495(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1443: 35.000000), (1492: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1429: 2), (1443: 4), (1472: 3), (1477: 1), (1491: 1), (1492: 9), (1493: 1), (1495: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
