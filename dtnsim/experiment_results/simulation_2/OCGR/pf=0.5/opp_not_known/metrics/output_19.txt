The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1826(1 to 12), 1839(6 to 3), 1866(8 to 2), 1871(4 to 5), 1891(2 to 4), 1892(9 to 10), 1893(12 to 11), 1901(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1839: 35.000000), (1891: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1826: 3), (1839: 4), (1866: 3), (1871: 3), (1891: 6), (1892: 2), (1893: 1), (1901: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
