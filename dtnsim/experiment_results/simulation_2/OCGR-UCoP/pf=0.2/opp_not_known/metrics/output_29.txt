The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1971(1 to 12), 1987(6 to 3), 2018(8 to 2), 2021(4 to 5), 2043(2 to 4), 2044(9 to 10), 2045(12 to 11), 2053(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2018: 60.000000), (2044: 20.000000), (2045: 20.000000), (2053: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1971: 3), (1987: 3), (2018: 3), (2021: 2), (2043: 4), (2044: 4), (2045: 3), (2053: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 128 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
