The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(1 to 12), 243(6 to 3), 275(8 to 2), 279(4 to 5), 301(2 to 4), 302(9 to 10), 303(12 to 11), 320(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 65.000000), (275: 60.000000), (279: 5.000000), (301: 20.000000), (302: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 3), (243: 6), (275: 3), (279: 4), (301: 8), (302: 4), (303: 3), (320: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
