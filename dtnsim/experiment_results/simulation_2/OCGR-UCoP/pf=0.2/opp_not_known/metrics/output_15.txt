The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(1 to 12), 237(6 to 3), 268(8 to 2), 273(4 to 5), 292(2 to 4), 293(9 to 10), 294(12 to 11), 301(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(268: 60.000000), (294: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 2), (237: 4), (268: 3), (273: 2), (292: 4), (293: 3), (294: 3), (301: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 130 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
