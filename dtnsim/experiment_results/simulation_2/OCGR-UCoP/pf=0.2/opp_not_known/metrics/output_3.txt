The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1556(1 to 12), 1571(6 to 3), 1602(8 to 2), 1609(4 to 5), 1629(2 to 4), 1630(9 to 10), 1631(12 to 11), 1637(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1556: 25.000000), (1571: 35.000000), (1631: 20.000000), (1637: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1556: 2), (1571: 4), (1602: 3), (1609: 2), (1629: 2), (1630: 5), (1631: 3), (1637: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 111 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
