The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
659(1 to 12), 674(6 to 3), 705(8 to 2), 712(4 to 5), 734(2 to 4), 735(9 to 10), 736(12 to 11), 746(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(659: 25.000000), (674: 35.000000), (705: 60.000000), (712: 25.000000), (734: 20.000000), (735: 20.000000), (736: 20.000000), (746: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(659: 2), (674: 4), (705: 3), (712: 6), (734: 10), (735: 6), (736: 5), (746: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 78 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
