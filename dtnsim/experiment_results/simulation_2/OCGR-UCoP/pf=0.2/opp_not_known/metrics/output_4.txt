The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1987(1 to 12), 2002(6 to 3), 2032(8 to 2), 2038(4 to 5), 2057(2 to 4), 2058(9 to 10), 2059(12 to 11), 2066(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1987: 65.000000), (2002: 35.000000), (2032: 60.000000), (2058: 20.000000), (2059: 20.000000), (2066: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1987: 3), (2002: 4), (2032: 3), (2038: 2), (2057: 3), (2058: 4), (2059: 3), (2066: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 99 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
