The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1529(1 to 12), 1543(6 to 3), 1574(8 to 2), 1581(4 to 5), 1602(2 to 4), 1603(9 to 10), 1604(12 to 11), 1612(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1529: 25.000000), (1581: 5.000000), (1603: 20.000000), (1604: 20.000000), (1612: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1529: 2), (1543: 4), (1574: 3), (1581: 4), (1602: 2), (1603: 4), (1604: 3), (1612: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 98 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
