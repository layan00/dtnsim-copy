The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1551(1 to 12), 1567(6 to 3), 1599(8 to 2), 1604(4 to 5), 1626(2 to 4), 1627(9 to 10), 1628(12 to 11), 1636(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1551: 25.000000), (1599: 60.000000), (1627: 20.000000), (1628: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1551: 2), (1567: 3), (1599: 3), (1604: 2), (1626: 4), (1627: 4), (1628: 3), (1636: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 109 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
