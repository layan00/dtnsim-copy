The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1083(1 to 12), 1098(6 to 3), 1127(8 to 2), 1133(4 to 5), 1154(2 to 4), 1155(9 to 10), 1156(12 to 11), 1163(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1098: 35.000000), (1127: 60.000000), (1155: 20.000000), (1156: 20.000000), (1163: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1083: 3), (1098: 4), (1127: 3), (1133: 1), (1154: 3), (1155: 4), (1156: 3), (1163: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
