The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1472(1 to 12), 1476(6 to 3), 1494(8 to 2), 1499(4 to 5), 1509(2 to 4), 1510(9 to 10), 1511(12 to 11), 1518(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1476: 35.000000), (1494: 60.000000), (1510: 20.000000), (1511: 20.000000), (1518: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1472: 3), (1476: 3), (1494: 3), (1499: 2), (1509: 4), (1510: 5), (1511: 3), (1518: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
