The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 12), 216(6 to 3), 234(8 to 2), 241(4 to 5), 249(2 to 4), 250(9 to 10), 251(12 to 11), 253(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 25.000000), (216: 35.000000), (234: 60.000000), (250: 20.000000), (253: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 2), (216: 3), (234: 3), (241: 1), (249: 1), (250: 5), (251: 1), (253: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 13 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
