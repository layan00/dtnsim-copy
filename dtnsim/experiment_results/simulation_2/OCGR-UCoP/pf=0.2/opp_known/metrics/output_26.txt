The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
523(1 to 12), 525(6 to 3), 544(8 to 2), 551(4 to 5), 560(2 to 4), 561(9 to 10), 562(12 to 11), 566(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(523: 25.000000), (525: 35.000000), (544: 60.000000), (562: 20.000000), (566: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(523: 2), (525: 3), (544: 3), (551: 1), (560: 1), (561: 3), (562: 3), (566: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 14 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
