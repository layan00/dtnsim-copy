The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
531(1 to 12), 534(6 to 3), 553(8 to 2), 560(4 to 5), 570(2 to 4), 571(9 to 10), 572(12 to 11), 579(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(531: 25.000000), (534: 35.000000), (553: 60.000000), (571: 20.000000), (579: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(531: 2), (534: 3), (553: 3), (560: 3), (570: 7), (571: 5), (572: 1), (579: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
