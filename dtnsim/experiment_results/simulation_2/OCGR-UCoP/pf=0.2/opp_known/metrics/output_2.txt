The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
861(1 to 12), 864(6 to 3), 882(8 to 2), 888(4 to 5), 899(2 to 4), 900(9 to 10), 901(12 to 11), 914(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(861: 65.000000), (864: 35.000000), (882: 60.000000), (888: 5.000000), (901: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(861: 3), (864: 3), (882: 3), (888: 4), (899: 8), (900: 4), (901: 3), (914: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
