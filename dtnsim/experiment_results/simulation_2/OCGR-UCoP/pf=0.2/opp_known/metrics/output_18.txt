The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1148(1 to 12), 1151(6 to 3), 1167(8 to 2), 1173(4 to 5), 1181(2 to 4), 1182(9 to 10), 1183(12 to 11), 1189(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1148: 65.000000), (1151: 35.000000), (1167: 60.000000), (1181: 60.000000), (1182: 20.000000), (1189: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1148: 3), (1151: 3), (1167: 3), (1173: 1), (1181: 6), (1182: 5), (1183: 1), (1189: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 14 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
