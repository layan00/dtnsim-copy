The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1183(1 to 12), 1187(6 to 3), 1206(8 to 2), 1213(4 to 5), 1223(2 to 4), 1224(9 to 10), 1225(12 to 11), 1232(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1183: 25.000000), (1187: 35.000000), (1206: 60.000000), (1224: 20.000000), (1225: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1183: 2), (1187: 3), (1206: 3), (1213: 2), (1223: 4), (1224: 5), (1225: 3), (1232: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
