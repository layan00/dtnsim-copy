The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1159(1 to 12), 1161(6 to 3), 1180(8 to 2), 1187(4 to 5), 1196(2 to 4), 1197(9 to 10), 1198(12 to 11), 1205(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1159: 25.000000), (1187: 5.000000), (1197: 20.000000), (1198: 20.000000), (1205: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1159: 2), (1161: 3), (1180: 3), (1187: 4), (1196: 2), (1197: 5), (1198: 3), (1205: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
