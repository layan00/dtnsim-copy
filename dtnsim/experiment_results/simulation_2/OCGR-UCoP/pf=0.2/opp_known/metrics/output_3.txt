The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1181(1 to 12), 1184(6 to 3), 1203(8 to 2), 1210(4 to 5), 1218(2 to 4), 1219(9 to 10), 1220(12 to 11), 1225(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1181: 25.000000), (1184: 35.000000), (1219: 60.000000), (1220: 20.000000), (1225: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1181: 2), (1184: 3), (1203: 3), (1210: 2), (1218: 2), (1219: 8), (1220: 3), (1225: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
