The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
845(1 to 12), 848(6 to 3), 866(8 to 2), 872(4 to 5), 882(2 to 4), 883(9 to 10), 884(12 to 11), 891(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(845: 65.000000), (848: 35.000000), (866: 60.000000), (883: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(845: 3), (848: 3), (866: 3), (872: 2), (882: 4), (883: 5), (884: 3), (891: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
