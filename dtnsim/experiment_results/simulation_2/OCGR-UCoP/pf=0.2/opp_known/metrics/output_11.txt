The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
518(1 to 12), 522(6 to 3), 540(8 to 2), 546(4 to 5), 553(2 to 4), 554(9 to 10), 555(12 to 11), 561(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(518: 65.000000), (540: 60.000000), (546: 5.000000), (555: 20.000000), (561: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(518: 3), (522: 3), (540: 3), (546: 4), (553: 1), (554: 4), (555: 3), (561: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
