The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
517(1 to 12), 519(6 to 3), 537(8 to 2), 544(4 to 5), 552(2 to 4), 553(9 to 10), 554(12 to 11), 558(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 25.000000), (519: 35.000000), (537: 60.000000), (558: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(517: 2), (519: 3), (537: 3), (544: 2), (552: 3), (553: 3), (554: 1), (558: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
