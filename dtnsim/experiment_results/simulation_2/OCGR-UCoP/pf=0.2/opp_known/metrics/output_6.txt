The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
528(1 to 12), 531(6 to 3), 550(8 to 2), 557(4 to 5), 567(2 to 4), 568(9 to 10), 569(12 to 11), 579(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(528: 25.000000), (531: 35.000000), (550: 60.000000), (557: 25.000000), (567: 20.000000), (568: 20.000000), (569: 20.000000), (579: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(528: 2), (531: 3), (550: 3), (557: 6), (567: 10), (568: 5), (569: 5), (579: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 14 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
