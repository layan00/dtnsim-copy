The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
542(1 to 12), 546(6 to 3), 564(8 to 2), 569(4 to 5), 578(2 to 4), 579(9 to 10), 580(12 to 11), 588(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(546: 35.000000), (564: 60.000000), (569: 5.000000), (579: 20.000000), (580: 20.000000), (588: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(542: 2), (546: 3), (564: 3), (569: 4), (578: 2), (579: 5), (580: 3), (588: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
