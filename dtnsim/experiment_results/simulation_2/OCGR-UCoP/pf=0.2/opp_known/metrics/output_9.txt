The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1497(1 to 12), 1501(6 to 3), 1519(8 to 2), 1526(4 to 5), 1535(2 to 4), 1536(9 to 10), 1537(12 to 11), 1540(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1497: 25.000000), (1501: 35.000000), (1536: 60.000000), (1540: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1497: 2), (1501: 3), (1519: 3), (1526: 3), (1535: 1), (1536: 8), (1537: 1), (1540: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
