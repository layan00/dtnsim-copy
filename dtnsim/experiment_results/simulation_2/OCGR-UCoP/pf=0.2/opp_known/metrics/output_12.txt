The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
828(1 to 12), 831(6 to 3), 848(8 to 2), 854(4 to 5), 863(2 to 4), 864(9 to 10), 865(12 to 11), 871(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(831: 35.000000), (848: 60.000000), (864: 20.000000), (865: 20.000000), (871: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(828: 3), (831: 3), (848: 3), (854: 1), (863: 3), (864: 5), (865: 3), (871: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
