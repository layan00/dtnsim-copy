The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
862(1 to 12), 866(6 to 3), 886(8 to 2), 893(4 to 5), 902(2 to 4), 903(9 to 10), 904(12 to 11), 909(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(862: 25.000000), (866: 35.000000), (903: 20.000000), (909: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(862: 2), (866: 3), (886: 3), (893: 3), (902: 3), (903: 5), (904: 1), (909: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
