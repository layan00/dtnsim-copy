The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1161(1 to 12), 1164(6 to 3), 1182(8 to 2), 1187(4 to 5), 1195(2 to 4), 1196(9 to 10), 1197(12 to 11), 1200(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1182: 60.000000), (1196: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1161: 2), (1164: 3), (1182: 3), (1187: 3), (1195: 2), (1196: 5), (1197: 1), (1200: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
