The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
78(1 to 12), 81(6 to 3), 88(8 to 2), 89(4 to 5), 96(2 to 4), 97(9 to 10), 98(12 to 11), 107(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(98: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 2), (81: 4), (88: 1), (89: 2), (96: 4), (97: 3), (98: 3), (107: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
