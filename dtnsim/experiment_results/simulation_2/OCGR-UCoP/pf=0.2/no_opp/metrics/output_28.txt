The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
501(1 to 12), 504(6 to 3), 510(8 to 2), 511(4 to 5), 519(2 to 4), 520(9 to 10), 521(12 to 11), 526(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(520: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(501: 2), (504: 2), (510: 2), (511: 3), (519: 2), (520: 4), (521: 1), (526: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
