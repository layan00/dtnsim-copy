The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
484(1 to 12), 486(6 to 3), 493(8 to 2), 496(4 to 5), 505(2 to 4), 506(9 to 10), 507(12 to 11), 518(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(484: 25.000000), (496: 5.000000), (506: 20.000000), (507: 20.000000), (518: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(484: 2), (486: 2), (493: 7), (496: 4), (505: 2), (506: 4), (507: 3), (518: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
