The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
78(1 to 12), 82(6 to 3), 89(8 to 2), 91(4 to 5), 101(2 to 4), 102(9 to 10), 103(12 to 11), 117(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(78: 65.000000), (82: 55.000000), (91: 5.000000), (103: 20.000000), (117: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 3), (82: 7), (89: 4), (91: 4), (101: 1), (102: 2), (103: 3), (117: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
