The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
524(1 to 12), 527(6 to 3), 534(8 to 2), 537(4 to 5), 545(2 to 4), 546(9 to 10), 547(12 to 11), 552(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(524: 25.000000), (547: 20.000000), (552: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(524: 2), (527: 2), (534: 1), (537: 2), (545: 2), (546: 5), (547: 3), (552: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
