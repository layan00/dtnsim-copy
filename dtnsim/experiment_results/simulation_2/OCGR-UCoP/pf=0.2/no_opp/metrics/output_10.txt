The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
79(1 to 12), 82(6 to 3), 88(8 to 2), 91(4 to 5), 100(2 to 4), 101(9 to 10), 102(12 to 11), 110(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(79: 25.000000), (102: 20.000000), (110: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(79: 2), (82: 2), (88: 5), (91: 1), (100: 2), (101: 3), (102: 3), (110: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
