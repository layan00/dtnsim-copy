The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
338(1 to 12), 341(6 to 3), 346(8 to 2), 348(4 to 5), 357(2 to 4), 358(9 to 10), 359(12 to 11), 369(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(346: 60.000000), (358: 20.000000), (359: 20.000000), (369: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(338: 3), (341: 3), (346: 7), (348: 1), (357: 3), (358: 4), (359: 3), (369: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
