The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
355(1 to 12), 358(6 to 3), 365(8 to 2), 367(4 to 5), 377(2 to 4), 378(9 to 10), 379(12 to 11), 387(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(355: 65.000000), (378: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(355: 3), (358: 3), (365: 1), (367: 2), (377: 4), (378: 4), (379: 3), (387: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
