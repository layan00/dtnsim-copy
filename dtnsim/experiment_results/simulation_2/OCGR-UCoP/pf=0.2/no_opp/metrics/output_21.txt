The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 12), 227(6 to 3), 234(8 to 2), 237(4 to 5), 247(2 to 4), 248(9 to 10), 249(12 to 11), 260(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 25.000000), (248: 20.000000), (260: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 2), (227: 5), (234: 2), (237: 3), (247: 7), (248: 4), (249: 1), (260: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
