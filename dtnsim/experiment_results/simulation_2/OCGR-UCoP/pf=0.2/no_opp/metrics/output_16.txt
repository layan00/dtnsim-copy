The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 12), 203(6 to 3), 209(8 to 2), 212(4 to 5), 220(2 to 4), 221(9 to 10), 222(12 to 11), 227(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 25.000000), (227: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 2), (203: 3), (209: 1), (212: 2), (220: 3), (221: 2), (222: 1), (227: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
