The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
650(1 to 12), 653(6 to 3), 659(8 to 2), 661(4 to 5), 668(2 to 4), 669(9 to 10), 670(12 to 11), 677(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(650: 65.000000), (669: 20.000000), (670: 20.000000), (677: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(650: 3), (653: 3), (659: 1), (661: 2), (668: 3), (669: 4), (670: 3), (677: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
