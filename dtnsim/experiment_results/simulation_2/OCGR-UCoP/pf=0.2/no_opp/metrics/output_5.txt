The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 12), 84(6 to 3), 91(8 to 2), 94(4 to 5), 102(2 to 4), 103(9 to 10), 104(12 to 11), 109(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 25.000000), (103: 20.000000), (109: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 2), (84: 4), (91: 2), (94: 1), (102: 1), (103: 4), (104: 1), (109: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
