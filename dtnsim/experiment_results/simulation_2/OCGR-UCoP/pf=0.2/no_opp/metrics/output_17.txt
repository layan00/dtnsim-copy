The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
321(1 to 12), 323(6 to 3), 327(8 to 2), 328(4 to 5), 339(2 to 4), 340(9 to 10), 341(12 to 11), 362(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(321: 65.000000), (323: 55.000000), (328: 5.000000), (339: 20.000000), (340: 60.000000), (341: 20.000000), (362: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(321: 3), (323: 8), (327: 6), (328: 4), (339: 8), (340: 5), (341: 3), (362: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
