The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
82(1 to 12), 86(6 to 3), 94(8 to 2), 97(4 to 5), 106(2 to 4), 107(9 to 10), 108(12 to 11), 125(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 25.000000), (94: 60.000000), (106: 20.000000), (107: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(82: 2), (86: 6), (94: 7), (97: 1), (106: 8), (107: 4), (108: 3), (125: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
