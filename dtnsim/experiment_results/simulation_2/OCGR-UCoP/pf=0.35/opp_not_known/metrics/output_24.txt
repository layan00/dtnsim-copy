The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1912(1 to 12), 1928(6 to 3), 1957(8 to 2), 1962(4 to 5), 1983(2 to 4), 1984(9 to 10), 1985(12 to 11), 1991(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1912: 25.000000), (1957: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1912: 2), (1928: 2), (1957: 3), (1962: 2), (1983: 3), (1984: 5), (1985: 3), (1991: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 25 calls to RUCoP, which took 144 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
