The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1497(1 to 12), 1513(6 to 3), 1544(8 to 2), 1549(4 to 5), 1569(2 to 4), 1570(9 to 10), 1571(12 to 11), 1579(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1497: 25.000000), (1544: 60.000000), (1570: 20.000000), (1571: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1497: 2), (1513: 3), (1544: 3), (1549: 2), (1569: 4), (1570: 4), (1571: 3), (1579: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
