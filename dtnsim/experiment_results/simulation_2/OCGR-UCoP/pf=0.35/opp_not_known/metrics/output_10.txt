The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 12), 231(6 to 3), 260(8 to 2), 267(4 to 5), 287(2 to 4), 288(9 to 10), 289(12 to 11), 294(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(217: 25.000000), (260: 60.000000), (289: 20.000000), (294: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 2), (231: 4), (260: 3), (267: 1), (287: 2), (288: 3), (289: 3), (294: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
