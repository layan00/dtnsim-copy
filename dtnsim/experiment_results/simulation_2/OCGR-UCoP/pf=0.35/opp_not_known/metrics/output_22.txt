The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1067(1 to 12), 1082(6 to 3), 1113(8 to 2), 1117(4 to 5), 1138(2 to 4), 1139(9 to 10), 1140(12 to 11), 1146(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1067: 65.000000), (1139: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1067: 3), (1082: 3), (1113: 3), (1117: 2), (1138: 2), (1139: 7), (1140: 3), (1146: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 27 calls to RUCoP, which took 157 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
