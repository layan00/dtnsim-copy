The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(1 to 12), 231(6 to 3), 260(8 to 2), 263(4 to 5), 282(2 to 4), 283(9 to 10), 284(12 to 11), 288(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(260: 60.000000), (283: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 3), (231: 4), (260: 3), (263: 1), (282: 1), (283: 5), (284: 1), (288: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 93 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
