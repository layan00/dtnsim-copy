The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1876(1 to 12), 1890(6 to 3), 1919(8 to 2), 1924(4 to 5), 1945(2 to 4), 1946(9 to 10), 1947(12 to 11), 1955(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1890: 35.000000), (1945: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1876: 3), (1890: 4), (1919: 3), (1924: 3), (1945: 6), (1946: 2), (1947: 1), (1955: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
