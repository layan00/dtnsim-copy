The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1918(1 to 12), 1932(6 to 3), 1962(8 to 2), 1968(4 to 5), 1987(2 to 4), 1988(9 to 10), 1989(12 to 11), 1996(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1918: 65.000000), (1932: 35.000000), (1988: 60.000000), (1989: 20.000000), (1996: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1918: 3), (1932: 4), (1962: 3), (1968: 2), (1987: 3), (1988: 5), (1989: 3), (1996: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 114 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
