The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1029(1 to 12), 1042(6 to 3), 1069(8 to 2), 1074(4 to 5), 1096(2 to 4), 1097(9 to 10), 1098(12 to 11), 1108(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1029: 65.000000), (1042: 35.000000), (1074: 25.000000), (1096: 20.000000), (1097: 60.000000), (1098: 20.000000), (1108: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1029: 3), (1042: 4), (1069: 3), (1074: 6), (1096: 10), (1097: 7), (1098: 5), (1108: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 96 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
