The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1051(1 to 12), 1066(6 to 3), 1097(8 to 2), 1101(4 to 5), 1120(2 to 4), 1121(9 to 10), 1122(12 to 11), 1126(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1097: 60.000000), (1121: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1051: 3), (1066: 2), (1097: 3), (1101: 2), (1120: 1), (1121: 4), (1122: 3), (1126: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 132 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
