The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1094(1 to 12), 1097(6 to 3), 1112(8 to 2), 1118(4 to 5), 1123(2 to 4), 1124(9 to 10), 1125(12 to 11), 1127(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1094: 65.000000), (1097: 35.000000), (1112: 60.000000), (1124: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1094: 3), (1097: 3), (1112: 3), (1118: 1), (1123: 1), (1124: 8), (1125: 1), (1127: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
