The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1424(1 to 12), 1427(6 to 3), 1444(8 to 2), 1451(4 to 5), 1457(2 to 4), 1458(9 to 10), 1459(12 to 11), 1461(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1424: 25.000000), (1427: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1424: 2), (1427: 3), (1444: 3), (1451: 1), (1457: 1), (1458: 3), (1459: 1), (1461: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
