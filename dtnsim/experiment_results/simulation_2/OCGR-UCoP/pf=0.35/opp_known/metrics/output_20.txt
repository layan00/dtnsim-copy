The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 12), 214(6 to 3), 233(8 to 2), 240(4 to 5), 248(2 to 4), 249(9 to 10), 250(12 to 11), 260(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 25.000000), (214: 35.000000), (233: 60.000000), (248: 20.000000), (249: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 2), (214: 3), (233: 3), (240: 1), (248: 8), (249: 5), (250: 3), (260: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
