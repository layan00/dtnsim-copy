The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
528(1 to 12), 532(6 to 3), 549(8 to 2), 554(4 to 5), 559(2 to 4), 560(9 to 10), 561(12 to 11), 564(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(532: 35.000000), (549: 60.000000), (560: 20.000000), (561: 20.000000), (564: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(528: 2), (532: 3), (549: 3), (554: 2), (559: 1), (560: 5), (561: 5), (564: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
