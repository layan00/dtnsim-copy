The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
825(1 to 12), 828(6 to 3), 845(8 to 2), 851(4 to 5), 858(2 to 4), 859(9 to 10), 860(12 to 11), 863(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(825: 65.000000), (828: 35.000000), (859: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(825: 3), (828: 3), (845: 3), (851: 3), (858: 1), (859: 8), (860: 1), (863: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
