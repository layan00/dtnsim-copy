The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
832(1 to 12), 835(6 to 3), 851(8 to 2), 857(4 to 5), 865(2 to 4), 866(9 to 10), 867(12 to 11), 871(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(832: 65.000000), (835: 35.000000), (851: 60.000000), (867: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(832: 3), (835: 3), (851: 3), (857: 1), (865: 1), (866: 4), (867: 3), (871: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
