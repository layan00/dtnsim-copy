The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
502(1 to 12), 503(6 to 3), 520(8 to 2), 526(4 to 5), 534(2 to 4), 535(9 to 10), 536(12 to 11), 540(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(502: 65.000000), (503: 35.000000), (520: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(502: 3), (503: 3), (520: 3), (526: 1), (534: 1), (535: 3), (536: 3), (540: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
