The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1129(1 to 12), 1131(6 to 3), 1149(8 to 2), 1154(4 to 5), 1159(2 to 4), 1160(9 to 10), 1161(12 to 11), 1164(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1131: 35.000000), (1160: 60.000000), (1164: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1129: 2), (1131: 3), (1149: 3), (1154: 2), (1159: 2), (1160: 8), (1161: 1), (1164: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
