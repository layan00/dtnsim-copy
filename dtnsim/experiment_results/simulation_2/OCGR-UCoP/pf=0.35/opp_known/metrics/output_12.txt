The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
807(1 to 12), 810(6 to 3), 826(8 to 2), 831(4 to 5), 840(2 to 4), 841(9 to 10), 842(12 to 11), 848(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(810: 35.000000), (841: 20.000000), (842: 20.000000), (848: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(807: 2), (810: 3), (826: 3), (831: 1), (840: 3), (841: 5), (842: 3), (848: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
