The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1423(1 to 12), 1427(6 to 3), 1443(8 to 2), 1450(4 to 5), 1459(2 to 4), 1460(9 to 10), 1461(12 to 11), 1467(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1423: 25.000000), (1427: 35.000000), (1443: 60.000000), (1460: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1423: 2), (1427: 3), (1443: 3), (1450: 2), (1459: 3), (1460: 8), (1461: 3), (1467: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
