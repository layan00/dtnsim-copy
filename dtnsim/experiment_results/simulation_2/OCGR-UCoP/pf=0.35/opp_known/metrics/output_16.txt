The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
488(1 to 12), 490(6 to 3), 506(8 to 2), 512(4 to 5), 519(2 to 4), 520(9 to 10), 521(12 to 11), 525(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(488: 65.000000), (490: 35.000000), (506: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(488: 3), (490: 3), (506: 3), (512: 2), (519: 3), (520: 3), (521: 1), (525: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
