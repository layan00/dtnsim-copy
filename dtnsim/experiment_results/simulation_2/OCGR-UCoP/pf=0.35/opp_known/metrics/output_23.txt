The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1118(1 to 12), 1120(6 to 3), 1138(8 to 2), 1145(4 to 5), 1152(2 to 4), 1153(9 to 10), 1154(12 to 11), 1157(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1118: 25.000000), (1153: 20.000000), (1157: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1118: 2), (1120: 3), (1138: 3), (1145: 3), (1152: 2), (1153: 5), (1154: 1), (1157: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
