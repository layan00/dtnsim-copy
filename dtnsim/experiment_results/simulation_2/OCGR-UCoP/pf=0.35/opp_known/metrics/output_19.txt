The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1388(1 to 12), 1390(6 to 3), 1407(8 to 2), 1412(4 to 5), 1421(2 to 4), 1422(9 to 10), 1423(12 to 11), 1430(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1390: 35.000000), (1421: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1388: 3), (1390: 3), (1407: 3), (1412: 3), (1421: 6), (1422: 3), (1423: 1), (1430: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
