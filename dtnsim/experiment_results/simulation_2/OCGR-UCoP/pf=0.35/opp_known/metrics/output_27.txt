The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
801(1 to 12), 804(6 to 3), 822(8 to 2), 828(4 to 5), 835(2 to 4), 836(9 to 10), 837(12 to 11), 841(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(804: 35.000000), (822: 60.000000), (836: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(801: 3), (804: 3), (822: 3), (828: 2), (835: 1), (836: 5), (837: 3), (841: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
