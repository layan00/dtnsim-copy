The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
204(1 to 12), 207(6 to 3), 223(8 to 2), 228(4 to 5), 235(2 to 4), 236(9 to 10), 237(12 to 11), 238(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 60.000000), (236: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(204: 3), (207: 3), (223: 3), (228: 1), (235: 1), (236: 8), (237: 1), (238: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
