The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1131(1 to 12), 1135(6 to 3), 1153(8 to 2), 1160(4 to 5), 1168(2 to 4), 1169(9 to 10), 1170(12 to 11), 1177(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1131: 25.000000), (1135: 35.000000), (1153: 60.000000), (1169: 20.000000), (1170: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1131: 2), (1135: 3), (1153: 3), (1160: 2), (1168: 4), (1169: 5), (1170: 3), (1177: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
