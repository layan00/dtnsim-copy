The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
508(1 to 12), 510(6 to 3), 528(8 to 2), 535(4 to 5), 545(2 to 4), 546(9 to 10), 547(12 to 11), 557(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(508: 25.000000), (510: 35.000000), (528: 60.000000), (535: 25.000000), (547: 20.000000), (557: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(508: 2), (510: 3), (528: 3), (535: 6), (545: 10), (546: 4), (547: 5), (557: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
