The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1400(1 to 12), 1403(6 to 3), 1420(8 to 2), 1425(4 to 5), 1433(2 to 4), 1434(9 to 10), 1435(12 to 11), 1439(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1403: 35.000000), (1420: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1400: 3), (1403: 3), (1420: 3), (1425: 2), (1433: 1), (1434: 4), (1435: 3), (1439: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
