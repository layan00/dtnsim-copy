The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1436(1 to 12), 1440(6 to 3), 1457(8 to 2), 1464(4 to 5), 1470(2 to 4), 1471(9 to 10), 1472(12 to 11), 1474(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1436: 25.000000), (1440: 35.000000), (1474: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1436: 2), (1440: 3), (1457: 3), (1464: 1), (1470: 1), (1471: 3), (1472: 1), (1474: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
