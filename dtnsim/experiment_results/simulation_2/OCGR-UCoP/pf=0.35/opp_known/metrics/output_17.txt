The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
779(1 to 12), 780(6 to 3), 795(8 to 2), 800(4 to 5), 810(2 to 4), 811(9 to 10), 812(12 to 11), 822(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(779: 65.000000), (780: 35.000000), (800: 25.000000), (810: 20.000000), (811: 60.000000), (812: 20.000000), (822: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(779: 3), (780: 3), (795: 3), (800: 6), (810: 10), (811: 7), (812: 5), (822: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
