The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
519(1 to 12), 522(6 to 3), 541(8 to 2), 548(4 to 5), 557(2 to 4), 558(9 to 10), 559(12 to 11), 563(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(519: 25.000000), (522: 35.000000), (541: 60.000000), (563: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(519: 2), (522: 3), (541: 3), (548: 3), (557: 2), (558: 4), (559: 1), (563: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 15 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
