The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
815(1 to 12), 818(6 to 3), 836(8 to 2), 842(4 to 5), 851(2 to 4), 852(9 to 10), 853(12 to 11), 858(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(815: 65.000000), (818: 35.000000), (852: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(815: 3), (818: 3), (836: 3), (842: 2), (851: 2), (852: 8), (853: 3), (858: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
