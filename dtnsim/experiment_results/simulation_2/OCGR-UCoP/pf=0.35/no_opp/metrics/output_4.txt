The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
557(1 to 12), 559(6 to 3), 565(8 to 2), 567(4 to 5), 574(2 to 4), 575(9 to 10), 576(12 to 11), 583(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(557: 65.000000), (575: 60.000000), (576: 20.000000), (583: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(557: 3), (559: 3), (565: 1), (567: 2), (574: 3), (575: 5), (576: 3), (583: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
