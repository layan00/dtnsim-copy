The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
318(1 to 12), 321(6 to 3), 326(8 to 2), 328(4 to 5), 335(2 to 4), 336(9 to 10), 337(12 to 11), 342(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(318: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(318: 3), (321: 3), (326: 2), (328: 3), (335: 1), (336: 5), (337: 1), (342: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
