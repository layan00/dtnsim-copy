The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
500(1 to 12), 502(6 to 3), 507(8 to 2), 508(4 to 5), 517(2 to 4), 518(9 to 10), 519(12 to 11), 530(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(500: 3), (502: 5), (507: 2), (508: 3), (517: 6), (518: 2), (519: 1), (530: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
