The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
446(1 to 12), 448(6 to 3), 454(8 to 2), 455(4 to 5), 460(2 to 4), 461(9 to 10), 462(12 to 11), 465(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(465: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(446: 2), (448: 2), (454: 1), (455: 2), (460: 2), (461: 5), (462: 1), (465: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
