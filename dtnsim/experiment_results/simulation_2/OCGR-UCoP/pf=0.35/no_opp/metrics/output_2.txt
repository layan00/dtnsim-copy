The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
332(1 to 12), 335(6 to 3), 339(8 to 2), 341(4 to 5), 349(2 to 4), 350(9 to 10), 351(12 to 11), 358(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(332: 65.000000), (351: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(332: 3), (335: 2), (339: 5), (341: 1), (349: 1), (350: 3), (351: 3), (358: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
