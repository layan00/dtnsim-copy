The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
397(1 to 12), 400(6 to 3), 403(8 to 2), 405(4 to 5), 410(2 to 4), 411(9 to 10), 412(12 to 11), 415(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(397: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(397: 3), (400: 4), (403: 1), (405: 1), (410: 1), (411: 1), (412: 1), (415: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 397: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 410: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 405: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5:
