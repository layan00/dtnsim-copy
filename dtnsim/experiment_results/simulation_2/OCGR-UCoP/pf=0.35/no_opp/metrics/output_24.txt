The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
560(1 to 12), 564(6 to 3), 569(8 to 2), 572(4 to 5), 581(2 to 4), 582(9 to 10), 583(12 to 11), 589(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(560: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(560: 2), (564: 2), (569: 1), (572: 2), (581: 3), (582: 5), (583: 3), (589: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
