The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
536(1 to 12), 539(6 to 3), 544(8 to 2), 545(4 to 5), 553(2 to 4), 554(9 to 10), 555(12 to 11), 561(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(536: 3), (539: 4), (544: 1), (545: 2), (553: 1), (554: 3), (555: 3), (561: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
