The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
72(1 to 12), 75(6 to 3), 80(8 to 2), 81(4 to 5), 88(2 to 4), 89(9 to 10), 90(12 to 11), 95(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(89: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(72: 3), (75: 4), (80: 2), (81: 1), (88: 1), (89: 5), (90: 1), (95: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
