The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
170(1 to 12), 172(6 to 3), 176(8 to 2), 178(4 to 5), 185(2 to 4), 186(9 to 10), 187(12 to 11), 192(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(170: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(170: 3), (172: 3), (176: 1), (178: 2), (185: 3), (186: 2), (187: 1), (192: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
