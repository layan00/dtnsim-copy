The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
73(1 to 12), 75(6 to 3), 80(8 to 2), 83(4 to 5), 91(2 to 4), 92(9 to 10), 93(12 to 11), 101(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(73: 25.000000), (93: 20.000000), (101: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(73: 2), (75: 2), (80: 5), (83: 1), (91: 2), (92: 3), (93: 3), (101: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
