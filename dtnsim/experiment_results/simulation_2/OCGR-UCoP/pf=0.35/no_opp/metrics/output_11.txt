The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(1 to 12), 192(6 to 3), 198(8 to 2), 200(4 to 5), 206(2 to 4), 207(9 to 10), 208(12 to 11), 218(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(189: 65.000000), (200: 5.000000), (208: 20.000000), (218: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 3), (192: 2), (198: 5), (200: 4), (206: 1), (207: 3), (208: 3), (218: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
