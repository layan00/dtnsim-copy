The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
778(1 to 12), 779(6 to 3), 794(8 to 2), 800(4 to 5), 807(2 to 4), 808(9 to 10), 809(12 to 11), 813(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(778: 65.000000), (794: 60.000000), (809: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(778: 3), (779: 3), (794: 3), (800: 1), (807: 1), (808: 2), (809: 3), (813: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
