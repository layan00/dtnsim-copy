The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
483(1 to 12), 485(6 to 3), 503(8 to 2), 510(4 to 5), 518(2 to 4), 519(9 to 10), 520(12 to 11), 526(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(483: 25.000000), (503: 60.000000), (510: 25.000000), (520: 20.000000), (526: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(483: 2), (485: 3), (503: 3), (510: 6), (518: 3), (519: 4), (520: 5), (526: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
