The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
479(1 to 12), 481(6 to 3), 497(8 to 2), 503(4 to 5), 509(2 to 4), 510(9 to 10), 511(12 to 11), 515(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(497: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(479: 3), (481: 3), (497: 3), (503: 2), (509: 3), (510: 2), (511: 1), (515: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
