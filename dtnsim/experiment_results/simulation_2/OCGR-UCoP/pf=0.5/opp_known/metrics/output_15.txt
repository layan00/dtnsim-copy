The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(1 to 12), 203(6 to 3), 220(8 to 2), 225(4 to 5), 229(2 to 4), 230(9 to 10), 231(12 to 11), 236(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 2), (203: 3), (220: 3), (225: 1), (229: 2), (230: 3), (231: 3), (236: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 200: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
