The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1076(1 to 12), 1080(6 to 3), 1098(8 to 2), 1104(4 to 5), 1111(2 to 4), 1112(9 to 10), 1113(12 to 11), 1122(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1098: 60.000000), (1104: 25.000000), (1113: 20.000000), (1122: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1076: 3), (1080: 3), (1098: 3), (1104: 6), (1111: 9), (1112: 4), (1113: 5), (1122: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
