The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
500(1 to 12), 503(6 to 3), 521(8 to 2), 527(4 to 5), 534(2 to 4), 535(9 to 10), 536(12 to 11), 539(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(503: 35.000000), (521: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(500: 3), (503: 3), (521: 3), (527: 2), (534: 2), (535: 5), (536: 1), (539: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
