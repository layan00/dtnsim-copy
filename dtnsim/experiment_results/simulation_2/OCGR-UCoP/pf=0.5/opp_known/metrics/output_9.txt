The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1340(1 to 12), 1344(6 to 3), 1358(8 to 2), 1363(4 to 5), 1368(2 to 4), 1369(9 to 10), 1370(12 to 11), 1373(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1344: 35.000000), (1373: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1340: 2), (1344: 3), (1358: 3), (1363: 1), (1368: 1), (1369: 2), (1370: 1), (1373: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
