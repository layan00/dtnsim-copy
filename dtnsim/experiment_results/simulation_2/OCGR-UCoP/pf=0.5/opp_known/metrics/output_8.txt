The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1059(1 to 12), 1062(6 to 3), 1078(8 to 2), 1085(4 to 5), 1089(2 to 4), 1090(9 to 10), 1091(12 to 11), 1096(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1059: 25.000000), (1062: 35.000000), (1078: 60.000000), (1090: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1059: 2), (1062: 3), (1078: 3), (1085: 1), (1089: 1), (1090: 4), (1091: 3), (1096: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
