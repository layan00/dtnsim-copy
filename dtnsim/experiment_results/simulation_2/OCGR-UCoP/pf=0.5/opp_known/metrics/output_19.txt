The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1334(1 to 12), 1335(6 to 3), 1350(8 to 2), 1355(4 to 5), 1363(2 to 4), 1364(9 to 10), 1365(12 to 11), 1373(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1335: 35.000000), (1363: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1334: 3), (1335: 3), (1350: 3), (1355: 3), (1363: 6), (1364: 2), (1365: 1), (1373: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
