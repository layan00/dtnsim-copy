The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 12), 204(6 to 3), 220(8 to 2), 227(4 to 5), 235(2 to 4), 236(9 to 10), 237(12 to 11), 242(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 25.000000), (220: 60.000000), (237: 20.000000), (242: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 2), (204: 3), (220: 3), (227: 1), (235: 2), (236: 3), (237: 3), (242: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
