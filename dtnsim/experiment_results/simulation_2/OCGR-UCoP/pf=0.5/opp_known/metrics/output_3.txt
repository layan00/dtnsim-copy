The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1057(1 to 12), 1059(6 to 3), 1076(8 to 2), 1081(4 to 5), 1083(2 to 4), 1084(9 to 10), 1085(12 to 11), 1087(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1059: 35.000000), (1084: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1057: 2), (1059: 3), (1076: 3), (1081: 1), (1083: 1), (1084: 9), (1085: 1), (1087: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
