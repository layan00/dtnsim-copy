The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
779(1 to 12), 781(6 to 3), 796(8 to 2), 801(4 to 5), 806(2 to 4), 807(9 to 10), 808(12 to 11), 810(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(779: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(779: 3), (781: 3), (796: 3), (801: 1), (806: 1), (807: 2), (808: 1), (810: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 779: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
