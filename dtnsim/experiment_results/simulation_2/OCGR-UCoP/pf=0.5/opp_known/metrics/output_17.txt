The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
758(1 to 12), 759(6 to 3), 773(8 to 2), 778(4 to 5), 785(2 to 4), 786(9 to 10), 787(12 to 11), 790(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(759: 35.000000), (786: 60.000000), (787: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(758: 3), (759: 3), (773: 3), (778: 1), (785: 1), (786: 8), (787: 5), (790: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
