The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
634(1 to 12), 649(6 to 3), 679(8 to 2), 685(4 to 5), 704(2 to 4), 705(9 to 10), 706(12 to 11), 709(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(649: 35.000000), (679: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(634: 3), (649: 4), (679: 3), (685: 2), (704: 2), (705: 5), (706: 1), (709: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 116 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
