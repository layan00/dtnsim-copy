The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1828(1 to 12), 1844(6 to 3), 1871(8 to 2), 1874(4 to 5), 1891(2 to 4), 1892(9 to 10), 1893(12 to 11), 1895(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1895: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1828: 2), (1844: 2), (1871: 3), (1874: 1), (1891: 1), (1892: 2), (1893: 1), (1895: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 87 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
