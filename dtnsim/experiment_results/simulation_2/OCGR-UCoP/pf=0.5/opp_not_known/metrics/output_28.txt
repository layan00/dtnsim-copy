The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1424(1 to 12), 1439(6 to 3), 1466(8 to 2), 1471(4 to 5), 1488(2 to 4), 1489(9 to 10), 1490(12 to 11), 1493(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1424: 2), (1439: 4), (1466: 3), (1471: 3), (1488: 1), (1489: 2), (1490: 1), (1493: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
