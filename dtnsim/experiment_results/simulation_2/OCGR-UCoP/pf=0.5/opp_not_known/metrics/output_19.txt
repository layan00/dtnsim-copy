The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1824(1 to 12), 1837(6 to 3), 1864(8 to 2), 1869(4 to 5), 1889(2 to 4), 1890(9 to 10), 1891(12 to 11), 1899(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1837: 35.000000), (1889: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1824: 3), (1837: 4), (1864: 3), (1869: 3), (1889: 6), (1890: 2), (1891: 1), (1899: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
