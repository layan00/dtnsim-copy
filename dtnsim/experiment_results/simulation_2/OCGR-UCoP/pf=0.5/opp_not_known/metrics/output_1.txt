The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
621(1 to 12), 634(6 to 3), 663(8 to 2), 668(4 to 5), 684(2 to 4), 685(9 to 10), 686(12 to 11), 689(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(634: 35.000000), (685: 60.000000), (686: 20.000000), (689: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(621: 2), (634: 4), (663: 3), (668: 2), (684: 1), (685: 9), (686: 5), (689: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 114 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
