The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1030(1 to 12), 1043(6 to 3), 1070(8 to 2), 1076(4 to 5), 1095(2 to 4), 1096(9 to 10), 1097(12 to 11), 1101(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1030: 65.000000), (1070: 60.000000), (1097: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1030: 3), (1043: 4), (1070: 3), (1076: 1), (1095: 1), (1096: 2), (1097: 3), (1101: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 95 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
