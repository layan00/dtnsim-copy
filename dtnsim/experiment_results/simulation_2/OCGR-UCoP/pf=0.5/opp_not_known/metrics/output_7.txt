The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1029(1 to 12), 1043(6 to 3), 1070(8 to 2), 1075(4 to 5), 1092(2 to 4), 1093(9 to 10), 1094(12 to 11), 1096(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1029: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1029: 3), (1043: 4), (1070: 3), (1075: 1), (1092: 1), (1093: 2), (1094: 1), (1096: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
