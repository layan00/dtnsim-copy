The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1827(1 to 12), 1841(6 to 3), 1870(8 to 2), 1875(4 to 5), 1894(2 to 4), 1895(9 to 10), 1896(12 to 11), 1899(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1841: 35.000000), (1870: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1827: 3), (1841: 4), (1870: 3), (1875: 2), (1894: 1), (1895: 2), (1896: 1), (1899: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 119 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
