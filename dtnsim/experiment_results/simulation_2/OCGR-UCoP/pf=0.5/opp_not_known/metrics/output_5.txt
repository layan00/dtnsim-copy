The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(1 to 12), 223(6 to 3), 251(8 to 2), 256(4 to 5), 274(2 to 4), 275(9 to 10), 276(12 to 11), 278(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(275: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 2), (223: 4), (251: 3), (256: 1), (274: 1), (275: 5), (276: 1), (278: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 111 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
