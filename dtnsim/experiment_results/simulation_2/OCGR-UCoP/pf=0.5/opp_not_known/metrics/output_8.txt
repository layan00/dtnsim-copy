The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1429(1 to 12), 1444(6 to 3), 1473(8 to 2), 1478(4 to 5), 1494(2 to 4), 1495(9 to 10), 1496(12 to 11), 1500(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1429: 25.000000), (1473: 60.000000), (1495: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1429: 2), (1444: 2), (1473: 3), (1478: 1), (1494: 1), (1495: 4), (1496: 3), (1500: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 83 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
