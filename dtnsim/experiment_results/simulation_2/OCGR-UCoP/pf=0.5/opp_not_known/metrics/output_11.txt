The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
624(1 to 12), 639(6 to 3), 668(8 to 2), 673(4 to 5), 690(2 to 4), 691(9 to 10), 692(12 to 11), 699(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(668: 60.000000), (673: 5.000000), (692: 20.000000), (699: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(624: 2), (639: 4), (668: 3), (673: 4), (690: 1), (691: 3), (692: 3), (699: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
