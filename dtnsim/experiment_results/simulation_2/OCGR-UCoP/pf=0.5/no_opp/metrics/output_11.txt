The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
179(1 to 12), 182(6 to 3), 187(8 to 2), 188(4 to 5), 193(2 to 4), 194(9 to 10), 195(12 to 11), 205(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(188: 5.000000), (195: 20.000000), (205: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(179: 2), (182: 2), (187: 5), (188: 4), (193: 1), (194: 3), (195: 3), (205: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
