The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
257(1 to 12), 258(6 to 3), 260(8 to 2), 261(4 to 5), 268(2 to 4), 269(9 to 10), 270(12 to 11), 278(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(257: 3), (258: 6), (260: 3), (261: 1), (268: 1), (269: 1), (270: 2), (278: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
