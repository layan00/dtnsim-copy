The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
520(1 to 12), 523(6 to 3), 528(8 to 2), 531(4 to 5), 536(2 to 4), 537(9 to 10), 538(12 to 11), 541(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(520: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(520: 2), (523: 3), (528: 2), (531: 1), (536: 1), (537: 1), (538: 1), (541: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 520: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 536: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 531: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 520: (to: 12, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 541: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6:
