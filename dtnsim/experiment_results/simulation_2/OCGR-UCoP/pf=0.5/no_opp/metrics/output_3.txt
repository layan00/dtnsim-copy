The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
369(1 to 12), 371(6 to 3), 376(8 to 2), 377(4 to 5), 379(2 to 4), 380(9 to 10), 381(12 to 11), 382(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(369: 2), (371: 2), (376: 1), (377: 1), (379: 1), (380: 1), (381: 1), (382: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 369: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 379: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4:

Node 6: 
Bundle 371: (to: 10, time: 20.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 376: (to: 12, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9:
