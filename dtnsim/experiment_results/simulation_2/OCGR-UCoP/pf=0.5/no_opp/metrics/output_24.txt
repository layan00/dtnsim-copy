The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
495(1 to 12), 498(6 to 3), 502(8 to 2), 505(4 to 5), 513(2 to 4), 514(9 to 10), 515(12 to 11), 521(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(495: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(495: 2), (498: 2), (502: 1), (505: 1), (513: 3), (514: 5), (515: 3), (521: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
