The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
276(1 to 12), 278(6 to 3), 281(8 to 2), 282(4 to 5), 287(2 to 4), 288(9 to 10), 289(12 to 11), 293(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(276: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(276: 3), (278: 3), (281: 2), (282: 1), (287: 1), (288: 2), (289: 1), (293: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 276: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
