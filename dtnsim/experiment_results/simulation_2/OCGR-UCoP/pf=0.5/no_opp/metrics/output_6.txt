The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
169(1 to 12), 171(6 to 3), 177(8 to 2), 180(4 to 5), 188(2 to 4), 189(9 to 10), 190(12 to 11), 199(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(169: 25.000000), (199: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(169: 2), (171: 3), (177: 3), (180: 4), (188: 3), (189: 1), (190: 2), (199: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
