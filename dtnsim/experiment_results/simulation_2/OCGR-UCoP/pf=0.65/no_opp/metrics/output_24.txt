The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
441(1 to 12), 443(6 to 3), 446(8 to 2), 448(4 to 5), 453(2 to 4), 454(9 to 10), 455(12 to 11), 459(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(441: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(441: 3), (443: 2), (446: 1), (448: 1), (453: 1), (454: 5), (455: 3), (459: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
