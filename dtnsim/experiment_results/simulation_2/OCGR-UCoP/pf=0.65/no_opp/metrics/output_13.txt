The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
351(1 to 12), 355(6 to 3), 361(8 to 2), 363(4 to 5), 369(2 to 4), 370(9 to 10), 371(12 to 11), 381(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(351: 3), (355: 5), (361: 3), (363: 4), (369: 2), (370: 1), (371: 2), (381: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
