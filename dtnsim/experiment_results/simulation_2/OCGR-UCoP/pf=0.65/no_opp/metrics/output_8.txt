The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
323(1 to 12), 325(6 to 3), 327(8 to 2), 329(4 to 5), 333(2 to 4), 334(9 to 10), 335(12 to 11), 339(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(334: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(323: 3), (325: 2), (327: 1), (329: 1), (333: 1), (334: 5), (335: 3), (339: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
