The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
233(1 to 12), 234(6 to 3), 236(8 to 2), 237(4 to 5), 241(2 to 4), 242(9 to 10), 243(12 to 11), 245(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(233: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(233: 3), (234: 2), (236: 2), (237: 1), (241: 1), (242: 1), (243: 1), (245: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 233: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
