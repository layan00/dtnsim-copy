The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
249(1 to 12), 251(6 to 3), 253(8 to 2), 254(4 to 5), 260(2 to 4), 261(9 to 10), 262(12 to 11), 270(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(261: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(249: 2), (251: 3), (253: 7), (254: 1), (260: 1), (261: 4), (262: 3), (270: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
