The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
316(1 to 12), 317(6 to 3), 319(8 to 2), 321(4 to 5), 326(2 to 4), 327(9 to 10), 328(12 to 11), 331(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(316: 3), (317: 4), (319: 1), (321: 1), (326: 1), (327: 1), (328: 1), (331: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 316: (to: 5, time: 40.000000),
