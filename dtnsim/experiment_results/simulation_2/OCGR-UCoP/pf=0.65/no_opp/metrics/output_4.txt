The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
389(1 to 12), 390(6 to 3), 395(8 to 2), 397(4 to 5), 400(2 to 4), 401(9 to 10), 402(12 to 11), 405(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(389: 3), (390: 3), (395: 1), (397: 1), (400: 1), (401: 1), (402: 2), (405: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 389: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 400: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 397: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 389: (to: 12, time: 40.000000), (to: 12, time: 80.000000),

Node 6: 
Bundle 390: (to: 10, time: 20.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8:
