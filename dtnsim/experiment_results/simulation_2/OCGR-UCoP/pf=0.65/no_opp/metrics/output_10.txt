The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
65(1 to 12), 67(6 to 3), 70(8 to 2), 71(4 to 5), 77(2 to 4), 78(9 to 10), 79(12 to 11), 82(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(65: 2), (67: 2), (70: 2), (71: 1), (77: 1), (78: 3), (79: 1), (82: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 65: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
