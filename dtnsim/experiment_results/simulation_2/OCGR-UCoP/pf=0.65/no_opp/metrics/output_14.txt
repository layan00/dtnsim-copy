The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
448(1 to 12), 451(6 to 3), 456(8 to 2), 459(4 to 5), 462(2 to 4), 463(9 to 10), 464(12 to 11), 465(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(448: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(448: 2), (451: 2), (456: 1), (459: 1), (462: 1), (463: 1), (464: 1), (465: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 16 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 448: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 462: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 459: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 448: (to: 12, time: 40.000000), 
Bundle 465: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 451: (to: 10, time: 20.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 456: (to: 12, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9:
