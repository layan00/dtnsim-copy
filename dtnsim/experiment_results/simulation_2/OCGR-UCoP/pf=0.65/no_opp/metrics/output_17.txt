The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
231(1 to 12), 232(6 to 3), 234(8 to 2), 235(4 to 5), 238(2 to 4), 239(9 to 10), 240(12 to 11), 244(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(231: 3), (232: 2), (234: 3), (235: 1), (238: 1), (239: 1), (240: 2), (244: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
