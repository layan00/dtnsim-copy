The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
407(1 to 12), 409(6 to 3), 413(8 to 2), 414(4 to 5), 420(2 to 4), 421(9 to 10), 422(12 to 11), 425(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(407: 3), (409: 4), (413: 1), (414: 2), (420: 1), (421: 1), (422: 1), (425: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
