The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
597(1 to 12), 610(6 to 3), 638(8 to 2), 643(4 to 5), 657(2 to 4), 658(9 to 10), 659(12 to 11), 661(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(658: 60.000000), (659: 20.000000), (661: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(597: 2), (610: 4), (638: 3), (643: 1), (657: 1), (658: 9), (659: 5), (661: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 96 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
