The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1773(1 to 12), 1789(6 to 3), 1816(8 to 2), 1819(4 to 5), 1835(2 to 4), 1836(9 to 10), 1837(12 to 11), 1839(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1773: 2), (1789: 2), (1816: 3), (1819: 1), (1835: 1), (1836: 2), (1837: 1), (1839: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
