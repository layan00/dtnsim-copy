The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
614(1 to 12), 628(6 to 3), 657(8 to 2), 663(4 to 5), 681(2 to 4), 682(9 to 10), 683(12 to 11), 686(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(628: 35.000000), (657: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(614: 3), (628: 4), (657: 3), (663: 1), (681: 2), (682: 5), (683: 1), (686: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 108 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
