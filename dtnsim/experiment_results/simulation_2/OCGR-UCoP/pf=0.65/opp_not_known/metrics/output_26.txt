The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
582(1 to 12), 595(6 to 3), 624(8 to 2), 630(4 to 5), 646(2 to 4), 647(9 to 10), 648(12 to 11), 651(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(582: 65.000000), (595: 35.000000), (624: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(582: 3), (595: 4), (624: 3), (630: 1), (646: 1), (647: 4), (648: 5), (651: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 118 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
