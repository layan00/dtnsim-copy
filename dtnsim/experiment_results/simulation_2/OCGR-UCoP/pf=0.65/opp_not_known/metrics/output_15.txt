The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(1 to 12), 222(6 to 3), 250(8 to 2), 255(4 to 5), 271(2 to 4), 272(9 to 10), 273(12 to 11), 278(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(250: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 2), (222: 4), (250: 3), (255: 1), (271: 2), (272: 3), (273: 3), (278: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 120 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
