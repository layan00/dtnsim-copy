The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(1 to 12), 219(6 to 3), 245(8 to 2), 250(4 to 5), 269(2 to 4), 270(9 to 10), 271(12 to 11), 276(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 35.000000), (270: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 3), (219: 4), (245: 3), (250: 1), (269: 1), (270: 4), (271: 3), (276: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 124 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
