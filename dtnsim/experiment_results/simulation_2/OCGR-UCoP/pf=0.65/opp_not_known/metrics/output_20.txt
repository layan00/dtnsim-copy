The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(1 to 12), 227(6 to 3), 259(8 to 2), 264(4 to 5), 281(2 to 4), 282(9 to 10), 283(12 to 11), 287(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 25.000000), (259: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 2), (227: 2), (259: 3), (264: 1), (281: 1), (282: 2), (283: 3), (287: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 129 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
