The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1407(1 to 12), 1420(6 to 3), 1448(8 to 2), 1454(4 to 5), 1470(2 to 4), 1471(9 to 10), 1472(12 to 11), 1474(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1407: 3), (1420: 4), (1448: 3), (1454: 1), (1470: 1), (1471: 2), (1472: 1), (1474: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 129 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
