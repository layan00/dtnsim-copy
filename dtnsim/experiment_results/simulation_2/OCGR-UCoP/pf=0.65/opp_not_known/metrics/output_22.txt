The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1011(1 to 12), 1025(6 to 3), 1055(8 to 2), 1058(4 to 5), 1079(2 to 4), 1080(9 to 10), 1081(12 to 11), 1087(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1011: 2), (1025: 3), (1055: 3), (1058: 2), (1079: 2), (1080: 3), (1081: 3), (1087: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 27 calls to RUCoP, which took 154 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
