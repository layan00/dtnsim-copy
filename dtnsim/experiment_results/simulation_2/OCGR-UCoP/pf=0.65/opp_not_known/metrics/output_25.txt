The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(1 to 12), 213(6 to 3), 240(8 to 2), 245(4 to 5), 261(2 to 4), 262(9 to 10), 263(12 to 11), 265(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 2), (213: 4), (240: 3), (245: 1), (261: 1), (262: 4), (263: 1), (265: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 86 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 200: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
