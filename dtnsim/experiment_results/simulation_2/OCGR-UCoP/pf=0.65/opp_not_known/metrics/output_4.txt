The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1758(1 to 12), 1771(6 to 3), 1800(8 to 2), 1806(4 to 5), 1821(2 to 4), 1822(9 to 10), 1823(12 to 11), 1825(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1758: 3), (1771: 4), (1800: 3), (1806: 1), (1821: 1), (1822: 4), (1823: 5), (1825: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 162 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
