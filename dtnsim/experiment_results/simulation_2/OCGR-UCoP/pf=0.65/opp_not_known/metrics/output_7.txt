The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
991(1 to 12), 1005(6 to 3), 1032(8 to 2), 1037(4 to 5), 1053(2 to 4), 1054(9 to 10), 1055(12 to 11), 1057(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(991: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(991: 3), (1005: 4), (1032: 3), (1037: 1), (1053: 1), (1054: 2), (1055: 1), (1057: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 106 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 991: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
