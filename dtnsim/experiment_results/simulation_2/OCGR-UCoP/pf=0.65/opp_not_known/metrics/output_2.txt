The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
990(1 to 12), 1003(6 to 3), 1029(8 to 2), 1034(4 to 5), 1050(2 to 4), 1051(9 to 10), 1052(12 to 11), 1053(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(990: 65.000000), (1029: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(990: 3), (1003: 4), (1029: 3), (1034: 1), (1050: 1), (1051: 4), (1052: 1), (1053: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 91 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
