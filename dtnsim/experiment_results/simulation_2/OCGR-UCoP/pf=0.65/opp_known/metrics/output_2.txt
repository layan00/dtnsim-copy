The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
738(1 to 12), 739(6 to 3), 753(8 to 2), 758(4 to 5), 762(2 to 4), 763(9 to 10), 764(12 to 11), 765(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(738: 65.000000), (753: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(738: 3), (739: 3), (753: 3), (758: 1), (762: 1), (763: 4), (764: 1), (765: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
