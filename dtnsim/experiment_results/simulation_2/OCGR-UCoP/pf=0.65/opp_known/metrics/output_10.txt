The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
197(1 to 12), 199(6 to 3), 214(8 to 2), 219(4 to 5), 225(2 to 4), 226(9 to 10), 227(12 to 11), 229(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(197: 2), (199: 3), (214: 3), (219: 1), (225: 1), (226: 3), (227: 1), (229: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
