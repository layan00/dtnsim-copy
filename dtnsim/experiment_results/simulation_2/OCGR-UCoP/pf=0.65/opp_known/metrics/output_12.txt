The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
755(1 to 12), 757(6 to 3), 771(8 to 2), 776(4 to 5), 782(2 to 4), 783(9 to 10), 784(12 to 11), 788(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(783: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(755: 2), (757: 3), (771: 3), (776: 1), (782: 1), (783: 4), (784: 3), (788: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
