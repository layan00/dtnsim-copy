The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
450(1 to 12), 451(6 to 3), 468(8 to 2), 474(4 to 5), 478(2 to 4), 479(9 to 10), 480(12 to 11), 483(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(450: 65.000000), (451: 35.000000), (468: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(450: 3), (451: 3), (468: 3), (474: 1), (478: 1), (479: 4), (480: 5), (483: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
