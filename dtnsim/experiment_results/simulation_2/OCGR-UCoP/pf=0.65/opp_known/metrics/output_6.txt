The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
465(1 to 12), 467(6 to 3), 483(8 to 2), 489(4 to 5), 494(2 to 4), 495(9 to 10), 496(12 to 11), 498(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(465: 65.000000), (498: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(465: 3), (467: 3), (483: 3), (489: 1), (494: 2), (495: 4), (496: 1), (498: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
