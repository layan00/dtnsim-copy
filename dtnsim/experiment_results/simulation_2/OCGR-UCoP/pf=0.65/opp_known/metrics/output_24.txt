The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1310(1 to 12), 1312(6 to 3), 1326(8 to 2), 1332(4 to 5), 1337(2 to 4), 1338(9 to 10), 1339(12 to 11), 1343(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1310: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1310: 3), (1312: 3), (1326: 3), (1332: 1), (1337: 1), (1338: 6), (1339: 3), (1343: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
