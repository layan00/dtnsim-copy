The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1266(1 to 12), 1267(6 to 3), 1284(8 to 2), 1290(4 to 5), 1293(2 to 4), 1294(9 to 10), 1295(12 to 11), 1297(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1266: 3), (1267: 3), (1284: 3), (1290: 1), (1293: 1), (1294: 4), (1295: 5), (1297: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
