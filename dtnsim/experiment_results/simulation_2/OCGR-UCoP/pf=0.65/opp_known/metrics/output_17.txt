The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
732(1 to 12), 733(6 to 3), 747(8 to 2), 752(4 to 5), 755(2 to 4), 756(9 to 10), 757(12 to 11), 759(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(757: 20.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(732: 3), (733: 3), (747: 3), (752: 1), (755: 1), (756: 5), (757: 5), (759: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
