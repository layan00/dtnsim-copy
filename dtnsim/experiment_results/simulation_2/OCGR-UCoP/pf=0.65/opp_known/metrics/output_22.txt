The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
761(1 to 12), 763(6 to 3), 780(8 to 2), 785(4 to 5), 794(2 to 4), 795(9 to 10), 796(12 to 11), 802(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(763: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(761: 2), (763: 3), (780: 3), (785: 2), (794: 2), (795: 3), (796: 3), (802: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
