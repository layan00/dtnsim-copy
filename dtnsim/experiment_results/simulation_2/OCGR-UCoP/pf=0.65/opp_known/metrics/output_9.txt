The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1281(1 to 12), 1285(6 to 3), 1299(8 to 2), 1304(4 to 5), 1308(2 to 4), 1309(9 to 10), 1310(12 to 11), 1313(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1285: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1281: 2), (1285: 3), (1299: 3), (1304: 1), (1308: 1), (1309: 2), (1310: 1), (1313: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1281: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
