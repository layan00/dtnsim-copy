The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
465(1 to 12), 466(6 to 3), 482(8 to 2), 487(4 to 5), 489(2 to 4), 490(9 to 10), 491(12 to 11), 493(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(490: 60.000000), (491: 20.000000), (493: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(465: 2), (466: 3), (482: 3), (487: 1), (489: 1), (490: 9), (491: 5), (493: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
