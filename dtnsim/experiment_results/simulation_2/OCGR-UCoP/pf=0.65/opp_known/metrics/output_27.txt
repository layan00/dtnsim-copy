The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
730(1 to 12), 733(6 to 3), 750(8 to 2), 756(4 to 5), 761(2 to 4), 762(9 to 10), 763(12 to 11), 766(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(733: 35.000000), (750: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(730: 3), (733: 3), (750: 3), (756: 2), (761: 1), (762: 4), (763: 5), (766: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
