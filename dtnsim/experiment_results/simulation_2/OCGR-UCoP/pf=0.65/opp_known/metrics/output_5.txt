The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
192(1 to 12), 194(6 to 3), 210(8 to 2), 215(4 to 5), 218(2 to 4), 219(9 to 10), 220(12 to 11), 222(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(192: 2), (194: 3), (210: 3), (215: 1), (218: 1), (219: 7), (220: 1), (222: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
