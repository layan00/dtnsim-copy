The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1005(1 to 12), 1006(6 to 3), 1020(8 to 2), 1026(4 to 5), 1031(2 to 4), 1032(9 to 10), 1033(12 to 11), 1035(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1006: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1005: 3), (1006: 3), (1020: 3), (1026: 1), (1031: 1), (1032: 5), (1033: 1), (1035: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
