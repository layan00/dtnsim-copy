The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1008(1 to 12), 1010(6 to 3), 1024(8 to 2), 1030(4 to 5), 1034(2 to 4), 1035(9 to 10), 1036(12 to 11), 1041(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1010: 35.000000), (1024: 60.000000), (1035: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1008: 3), (1010: 3), (1024: 3), (1030: 1), (1034: 1), (1035: 7), (1036: 3), (1041: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
