The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 12), 203(6 to 3), 222(8 to 2), 229(4 to 5), 234(2 to 4), 235(9 to 10), 236(12 to 11), 241(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 25.000000), (203: 35.000000), (222: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 2), (203: 3), (222: 3), (229: 1), (234: 1), (235: 2), (236: 3), (241: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
