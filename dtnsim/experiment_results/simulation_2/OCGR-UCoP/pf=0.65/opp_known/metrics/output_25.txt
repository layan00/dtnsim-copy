The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
188(1 to 12), 189(6 to 3), 204(8 to 2), 209(4 to 5), 213(2 to 4), 214(9 to 10), 215(12 to 11), 217(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(189: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(188: 2), (189: 3), (204: 3), (209: 1), (213: 1), (214: 4), (215: 1), (217: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 188: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
