The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
739(1 to 12), 741(6 to 3), 756(8 to 2), 761(4 to 5), 765(2 to 4), 766(9 to 10), 767(12 to 11), 769(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(739: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(739: 3), (741: 3), (756: 3), (761: 1), (765: 1), (766: 2), (767: 1), (769: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 739: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
