The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
190(1 to 12), 193(6 to 3), 197(8 to 2), 198(4 to 5), 201(2 to 4), 202(9 to 10), 203(12 to 11), 205(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(190: 2), (193: 2), (197: 1), (198: 1), (201: 1), (202: 1), (203: 2), (205: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 190: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 201: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 198: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 205: (to: 11, time: 80.000000),
