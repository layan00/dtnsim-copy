The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
352(1 to 12), 354(6 to 3), 356(8 to 2), 357(4 to 5), 360(2 to 4), 361(9 to 10), 362(12 to 11), 363(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(352: 3), (354: 2), (356: 1), (357: 1), (360: 1), (361: 1), (362: 1), (363: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 352: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
