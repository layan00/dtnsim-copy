The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
359(1 to 12), 360(6 to 3), 362(8 to 2), 364(4 to 5), 368(2 to 4), 369(9 to 10), 370(12 to 11), 375(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(359: 3), (360: 3), (362: 1), (364: 1), (368: 1), (369: 3), (370: 3), (375: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
