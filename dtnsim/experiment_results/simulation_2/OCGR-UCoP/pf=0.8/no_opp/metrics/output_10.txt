The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
55(1 to 12), 56(6 to 3), 58(8 to 2), 59(4 to 5), 62(2 to 4), 63(9 to 10), 64(12 to 11), 66(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(55: 2), (56: 2), (58: 1), (59: 1), (62: 1), (63: 3), (64: 1), (66: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 55: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 63: (to: 4, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 62: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4:
