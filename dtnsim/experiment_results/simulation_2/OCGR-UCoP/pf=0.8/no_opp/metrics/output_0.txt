The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
57(1 to 12), 59(6 to 3), 61(8 to 2), 62(4 to 5), 68(2 to 4), 69(9 to 10), 70(12 to 11), 77(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(57: 3), (59: 2), (61: 5), (62: 1), (68: 1), (69: 3), (70: 3), (77: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 65 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
