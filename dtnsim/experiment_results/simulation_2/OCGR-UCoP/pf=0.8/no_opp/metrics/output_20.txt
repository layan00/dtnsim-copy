The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
59(1 to 12), 61(6 to 3), 68(8 to 2), 70(4 to 5), 73(2 to 4), 74(9 to 10), 75(12 to 11), 79(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(59: 3), (61: 2), (68: 1), (70: 1), (73: 1), (74: 2), (75: 3), (79: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
