The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
345(1 to 12), 346(6 to 3), 350(8 to 2), 352(4 to 5), 355(2 to 4), 356(9 to 10), 357(12 to 11), 360(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(345: 3), (346: 3), (350: 1), (352: 1), (355: 1), (356: 1), (357: 2), (360: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
