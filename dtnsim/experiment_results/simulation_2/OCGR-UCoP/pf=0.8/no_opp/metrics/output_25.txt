The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
51(1 to 12), 52(6 to 3), 53(8 to 2), 54(4 to 5), 56(2 to 4), 57(9 to 10), 58(12 to 11), 60(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(51: 2), (52: 2), (53: 2), (54: 1), (56: 1), (57: 1), (58: 1), (60: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 51: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 56: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 54: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 60: (to: 11, time: 80.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 52: (to: 10, time: 20.000000), (to: 10, time: 60.000000), 
Node 7:
