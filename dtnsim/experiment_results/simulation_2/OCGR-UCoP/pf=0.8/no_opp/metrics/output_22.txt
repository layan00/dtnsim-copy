The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 12), 212(6 to 3), 216(8 to 2), 217(4 to 5), 222(2 to 4), 223(9 to 10), 224(12 to 11), 227(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 2), (212: 2), (216: 1), (217: 2), (222: 2), (223: 2), (224: 1), (227: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
