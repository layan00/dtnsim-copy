The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1730(1 to 12), 1745(6 to 3), 1771(8 to 2), 1774(4 to 5), 1789(2 to 4), 1790(9 to 10), 1791(12 to 11), 1793(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1730: 2), (1745: 2), (1771: 3), (1774: 1), (1789: 1), (1790: 2), (1791: 1), (1793: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 89 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
