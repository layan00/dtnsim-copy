The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1334(1 to 12), 1348(6 to 3), 1375(8 to 2), 1380(4 to 5), 1393(2 to 4), 1394(9 to 10), 1395(12 to 11), 1396(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1334: 2), (1348: 4), (1375: 3), (1380: 1), (1393: 1), (1394: 4), (1395: 1), (1396: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
