The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1344(1 to 12), 1358(6 to 3), 1386(8 to 2), 1392(4 to 5), 1406(2 to 4), 1407(9 to 10), 1408(12 to 11), 1410(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1344: 3), (1358: 4), (1386: 3), (1392: 1), (1406: 1), (1407: 4), (1408: 5), (1410: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 27 calls to RUCoP, which took 151 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
