The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1343(1 to 12), 1356(6 to 3), 1381(8 to 2), 1386(4 to 5), 1401(2 to 4), 1402(9 to 10), 1403(12 to 11), 1405(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1343: 2), (1356: 4), (1381: 3), (1386: 1), (1401: 1), (1402: 2), (1403: 1), (1405: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 87 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
