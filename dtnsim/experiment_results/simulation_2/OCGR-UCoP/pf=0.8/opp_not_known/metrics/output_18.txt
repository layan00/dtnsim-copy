The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1335(1 to 12), 1348(6 to 3), 1374(8 to 2), 1380(4 to 5), 1395(2 to 4), 1396(9 to 10), 1397(12 to 11), 1399(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1348: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1335: 3), (1348: 4), (1374: 3), (1380: 1), (1395: 1), (1396: 5), (1397: 1), (1399: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
