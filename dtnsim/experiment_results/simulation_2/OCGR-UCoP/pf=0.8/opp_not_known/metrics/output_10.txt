The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
199(1 to 12), 212(6 to 3), 238(8 to 2), 243(4 to 5), 258(2 to 4), 259(9 to 10), 260(12 to 11), 262(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(199: 2), (212: 4), (238: 3), (243: 1), (258: 1), (259: 3), (260: 1), (262: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 99 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
