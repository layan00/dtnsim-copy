The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
968(1 to 12), 982(6 to 3), 1007(8 to 2), 1012(4 to 5), 1027(2 to 4), 1028(9 to 10), 1029(12 to 11), 1030(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(968: 3), (982: 4), (1007: 3), (1012: 1), (1027: 1), (1028: 4), (1029: 1), (1030: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
