The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 12), 215(6 to 3), 241(8 to 2), 246(4 to 5), 264(2 to 4), 265(9 to 10), 266(12 to 11), 271(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 3), (215: 4), (241: 3), (246: 1), (264: 1), (265: 3), (266: 3), (271: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 126 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
