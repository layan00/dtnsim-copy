The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1720(1 to 12), 1734(6 to 3), 1760(8 to 2), 1765(4 to 5), 1780(2 to 4), 1781(9 to 10), 1782(12 to 11), 1783(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1760: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1720: 3), (1734: 4), (1760: 3), (1765: 1), (1780: 1), (1781: 4), (1782: 1), (1783: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
