The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
585(1 to 12), 598(6 to 3), 624(8 to 2), 629(4 to 5), 643(2 to 4), 644(9 to 10), 645(12 to 11), 647(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(598: 35.000000), (624: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(585: 2), (598: 4), (624: 3), (629: 1), (643: 1), (644: 5), (645: 1), (647: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 54 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
