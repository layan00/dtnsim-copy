The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1348(1 to 12), 1362(6 to 3), 1388(8 to 2), 1394(4 to 5), 1409(2 to 4), 1410(9 to 10), 1411(12 to 11), 1414(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1362: 35.000000), (1410: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1348: 3), (1362: 4), (1388: 3), (1394: 1), (1409: 1), (1410: 7), (1411: 1), (1414: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 100 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
