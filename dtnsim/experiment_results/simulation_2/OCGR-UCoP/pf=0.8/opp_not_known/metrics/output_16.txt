The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
581(1 to 12), 594(6 to 3), 620(8 to 2), 625(4 to 5), 639(2 to 4), 640(9 to 10), 641(12 to 11), 642(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(581: 2), (594: 4), (620: 3), (625: 2), (639: 1), (640: 4), (641: 1), (642: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 117 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
