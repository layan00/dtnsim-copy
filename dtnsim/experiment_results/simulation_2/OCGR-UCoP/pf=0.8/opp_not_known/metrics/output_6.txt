The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
586(1 to 12), 599(6 to 3), 627(8 to 2), 633(4 to 5), 649(2 to 4), 650(9 to 10), 651(12 to 11), 653(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(653: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(586: 3), (599: 4), (627: 3), (633: 1), (649: 2), (650: 4), (651: 1), (653: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 133 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
