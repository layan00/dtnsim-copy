The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
195(1 to 12), 208(6 to 3), 233(8 to 2), 238(4 to 5), 252(2 to 4), 253(9 to 10), 254(12 to 11), 255(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(195: 2), (208: 4), (233: 3), (238: 1), (252: 1), (253: 4), (254: 1), (255: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 106 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
