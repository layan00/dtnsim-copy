The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
962(1 to 12), 964(6 to 3), 979(8 to 2), 984(4 to 5), 985(2 to 4), 986(9 to 10), 987(12 to 11), 988(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(962: 2), (964: 3), (979: 3), (984: 1), (985: 1), (986: 4), (987: 1), (988: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
