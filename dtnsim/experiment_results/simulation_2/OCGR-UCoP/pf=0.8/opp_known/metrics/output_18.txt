The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
963(1 to 12), 964(6 to 3), 978(8 to 2), 984(4 to 5), 987(2 to 4), 988(9 to 10), 989(12 to 11), 991(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(964: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(963: 3), (964: 3), (978: 3), (984: 1), (987: 1), (988: 5), (989: 1), (991: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
