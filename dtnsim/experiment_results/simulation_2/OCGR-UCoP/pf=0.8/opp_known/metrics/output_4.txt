The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1218(1 to 12), 1219(6 to 3), 1235(8 to 2), 1241(4 to 5), 1244(2 to 4), 1245(9 to 10), 1246(12 to 11), 1248(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1218: 3), (1219: 3), (1235: 3), (1241: 1), (1244: 1), (1245: 4), (1246: 5), (1248: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
