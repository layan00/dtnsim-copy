The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
191(1 to 12), 193(6 to 3), 211(8 to 2), 217(4 to 5), 220(2 to 4), 221(9 to 10), 222(12 to 11), 226(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 3), (193: 3), (211: 3), (217: 1), (220: 1), (221: 2), (222: 3), (226: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
