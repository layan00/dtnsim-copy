The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
183(1 to 12), 184(6 to 3), 197(8 to 2), 202(4 to 5), 204(2 to 4), 205(9 to 10), 206(12 to 11), 207(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(183: 2), (184: 3), (197: 3), (202: 1), (204: 1), (205: 4), (206: 1), (207: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
