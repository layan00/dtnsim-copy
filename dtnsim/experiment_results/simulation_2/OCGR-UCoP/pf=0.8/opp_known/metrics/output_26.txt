The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
432(1 to 12), 433(6 to 3), 446(8 to 2), 451(4 to 5), 454(2 to 4), 455(9 to 10), 456(12 to 11), 458(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(433: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(432: 2), (433: 3), (446: 3), (451: 1), (454: 1), (455: 4), (456: 1), (458: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 432: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
