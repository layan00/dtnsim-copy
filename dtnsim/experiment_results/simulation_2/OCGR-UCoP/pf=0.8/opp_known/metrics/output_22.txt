The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
714(1 to 12), 716(6 to 3), 731(8 to 2), 736(4 to 5), 741(2 to 4), 742(9 to 10), 743(12 to 11), 747(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(716: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(714: 2), (716: 3), (731: 3), (736: 2), (741: 2), (742: 2), (743: 1), (747: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
