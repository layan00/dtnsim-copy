The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
974(1 to 12), 975(6 to 3), 988(8 to 2), 993(4 to 5), 996(2 to 4), 997(9 to 10), 998(12 to 11), 1000(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(974: 2), (975: 3), (988: 3), (993: 1), (996: 1), (997: 2), (998: 1), (1000: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
