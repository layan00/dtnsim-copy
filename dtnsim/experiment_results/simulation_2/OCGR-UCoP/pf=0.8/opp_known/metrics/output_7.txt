The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
716(1 to 12), 718(6 to 3), 731(8 to 2), 736(4 to 5), 739(2 to 4), 740(9 to 10), 741(12 to 11), 742(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(716: 3), (718: 3), (731: 3), (736: 1), (739: 1), (740: 4), (741: 1), (742: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
