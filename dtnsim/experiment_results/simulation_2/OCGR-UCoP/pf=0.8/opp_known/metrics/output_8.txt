The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
976(1 to 12), 978(6 to 3), 992(8 to 2), 998(4 to 5), 1001(2 to 4), 1002(9 to 10), 1003(12 to 11), 1006(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(978: 35.000000), (1002: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(976: 3), (978: 3), (992: 3), (998: 1), (1001: 1), (1002: 7), (1003: 1), (1006: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
