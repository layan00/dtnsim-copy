The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1229(1 to 12), 1231(6 to 3), 1245(8 to 2), 1250(4 to 5), 1253(2 to 4), 1254(9 to 10), 1255(12 to 11), 1256(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1245: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1229: 3), (1231: 3), (1245: 3), (1250: 1), (1253: 1), (1254: 4), (1255: 1), (1256: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
