The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
963(1 to 12), 965(6 to 3), 980(8 to 2), 985(4 to 5), 989(2 to 4), 990(9 to 10), 991(12 to 11), 993(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(963: 2), (965: 3), (980: 3), (985: 3), (989: 1), (990: 4), (991: 1), (993: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
