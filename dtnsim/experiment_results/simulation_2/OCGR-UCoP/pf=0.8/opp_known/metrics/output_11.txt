The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
445(1 to 12), 447(6 to 3), 461(8 to 2), 466(4 to 5), 469(2 to 4), 470(9 to 10), 471(12 to 11), 473(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(461: 60.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(445: 2), (447: 3), (461: 3), (466: 2), (469: 1), (470: 5), (471: 5), (473: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
