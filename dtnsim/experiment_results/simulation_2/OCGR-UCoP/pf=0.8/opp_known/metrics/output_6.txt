The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
454(1 to 12), 455(6 to 3), 471(8 to 2), 477(4 to 5), 481(2 to 4), 482(9 to 10), 483(12 to 11), 485(5 to 3), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(485: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(454: 3), (455: 3), (471: 3), (477: 1), (481: 2), (482: 4), (483: 1), (485: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
