The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
553(1 to 12), 554(12 to 5), 564(7 to 3), 565(10 to 6), 566(11 to 1), 572(6 to 7), 606(3 to 4), 612(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(553: 40.000000), (554: 50.000000), (565: 15.000000), (572: 5.000000), (606: 10.000000), (612: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(553: 6), (554: 6), (564: 2), (565: 4), (566: 4), (572: 5), (606: 2), (612: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
