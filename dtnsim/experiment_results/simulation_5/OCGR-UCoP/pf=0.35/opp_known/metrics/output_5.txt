The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 12), 216(12 to 5), 222(7 to 3), 223(10 to 6), 224(11 to 1), 233(6 to 7), 263(3 to 4), 266(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(216: 30.000000), (222: 25.000000), (224: 15.000000), (263: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 6), (216: 4), (222: 3), (223: 2), (224: 3), (233: 3), (263: 2), (266: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
