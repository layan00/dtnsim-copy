The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
844(1 to 12), 845(12 to 5), 854(7 to 3), 855(10 to 6), 856(11 to 1), 864(6 to 7), 893(3 to 4), 899(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(844: 40.000000), (845: 30.000000), (854: 25.000000), (855: 15.000000), (856: 25.000000), (893: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(844: 6), (845: 4), (854: 3), (855: 4), (856: 4), (864: 1), (893: 2), (899: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
