The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
847(1 to 12), 848(12 to 5), 852(7 to 3), 853(10 to 6), 854(11 to 1), 863(6 to 7), 895(3 to 4), 900(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(847: 40.000000), (853: 15.000000), (854: 25.000000), (895: 10.000000), (900: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(847: 6), (848: 2), (852: 3), (853: 4), (854: 4), (863: 3), (895: 2), (900: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
