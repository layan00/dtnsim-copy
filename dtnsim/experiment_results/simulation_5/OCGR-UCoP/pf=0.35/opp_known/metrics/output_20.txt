The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 12), 219(12 to 5), 227(7 to 3), 228(10 to 6), 229(11 to 1), 235(6 to 7), 267(3 to 4), 269(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 80.000000), (219: 30.000000), (229: 15.000000), (235: 5.000000), (267: 10.000000), (269: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 4), (219: 4), (227: 2), (228: 2), (229: 3), (235: 5), (267: 2), (269: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
