The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
530(1 to 12), 531(12 to 5), 536(7 to 3), 537(10 to 6), 538(11 to 1), 548(6 to 7), 576(3 to 4), 579(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(530: 40.000000), (579: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(530: 6), (531: 2), (536: 3), (537: 5), (538: 4), (548: 3), (576: 1), (579: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
