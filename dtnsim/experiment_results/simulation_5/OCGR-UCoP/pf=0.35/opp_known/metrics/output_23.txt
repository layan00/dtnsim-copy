The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1167(1 to 12), 1168(12 to 5), 1176(7 to 3), 1177(10 to 6), 1178(11 to 1), 1186(6 to 7), 1217(3 to 4), 1218(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1168: 30.000000), (1177: 15.000000), (1178: 15.000000), (1218: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1167: 6), (1168: 4), (1176: 2), (1177: 4), (1178: 3), (1186: 3), (1217: 1), (1218: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
