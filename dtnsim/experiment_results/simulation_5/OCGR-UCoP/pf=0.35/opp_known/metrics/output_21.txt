The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
532(1 to 12), 533(12 to 5), 538(7 to 3), 539(10 to 6), 540(11 to 1), 548(6 to 7), 583(3 to 4), 585(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(533: 40.000000), (539: 15.000000), (540: 15.000000), (583: 10.000000), (585: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(532: 6), (533: 4), (538: 3), (539: 4), (540: 3), (548: 1), (583: 2), (585: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
