The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
668(1 to 12), 669(12 to 5), 687(7 to 3), 688(10 to 6), 689(11 to 1), 701(6 to 7), 739(3 to 4), 740(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(668: 80.000000), (688: 15.000000), (740: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(668: 3), (669: 1), (687: 1), (688: 4), (689: 4), (701: 3), (739: 1), (740: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 69 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
