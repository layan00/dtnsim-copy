The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
685(1 to 12), 686(12 to 5), 708(7 to 3), 709(10 to 6), 710(11 to 1), 718(6 to 7), 757(3 to 4), 761(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(686: 50.000000), (709: 65.000000), (710: 55.000000), (718: 5.000000), (757: 10.000000), (761: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(685: 3), (686: 6), (708: 1), (709: 6), (710: 8), (718: 5), (757: 2), (761: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 100 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
