The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1529(1 to 12), 1530(12 to 5), 1547(7 to 3), 1548(10 to 6), 1549(11 to 1), 1557(6 to 7), 1594(3 to 4), 1595(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1529: 80.000000), (1548: 15.000000), (1595: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1529: 3), (1530: 1), (1547: 1), (1548: 5), (1549: 2), (1557: 3), (1594: 1), (1595: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 73 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
