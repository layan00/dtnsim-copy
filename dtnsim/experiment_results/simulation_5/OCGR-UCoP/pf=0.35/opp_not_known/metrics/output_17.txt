The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1093(1 to 12), 1094(12 to 5), 1112(7 to 3), 1113(10 to 6), 1114(11 to 1), 1123(6 to 7), 1158(3 to 4), 1162(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1093: 80.000000), (1113: 15.000000), (1158: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1093: 3), (1094: 1), (1112: 3), (1113: 4), (1114: 5), (1123: 1), (1158: 2), (1162: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 91 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
