The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(1 to 12), 226(12 to 5), 243(7 to 3), 244(10 to 6), 245(11 to 1), 251(6 to 7), 284(3 to 4), 287(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 45.000000), (244: 65.000000), (284: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 3), (226: 1), (243: 3), (244: 4), (245: 2), (251: 1), (284: 2), (287: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 99 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
