The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1960(1 to 12), 1961(12 to 5), 1979(7 to 3), 1980(10 to 6), 1981(11 to 1), 1994(6 to 7), 2031(3 to 4), 2033(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1960: 80.000000), (1980: 15.000000), (1981: 5.000000), (2033: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1960: 3), (1961: 1), (1979: 1), (1980: 4), (1981: 4), (1994: 3), (2031: 2), (2033: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 57 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
