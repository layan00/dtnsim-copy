The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
660(1 to 12), 661(12 to 5), 678(7 to 3), 679(10 to 6), 680(11 to 1), 690(6 to 7), 724(3 to 4), 728(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(678: 45.000000), (728: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(660: 3), (661: 1), (678: 3), (679: 5), (680: 5), (690: 3), (724: 1), (728: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 149 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
