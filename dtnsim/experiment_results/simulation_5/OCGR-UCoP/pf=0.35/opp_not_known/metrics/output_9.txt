The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1971(1 to 12), 1972(12 to 5), 1989(7 to 3), 1990(10 to 6), 1991(11 to 1), 2004(6 to 7), 2044(3 to 4), 2049(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1971: 80.000000), (1972: 40.000000), (1991: 5.000000), (2049: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1971: 3), (1972: 3), (1989: 1), (1990: 6), (1991: 4), (2004: 7), (2044: 2), (2049: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
