The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(1 to 12), 228(12 to 5), 243(7 to 3), 244(10 to 6), 245(11 to 1), 252(6 to 7), 294(3 to 4), 299(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 80.000000), (243: 25.000000), (245: 15.000000), (294: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 3), (228: 1), (243: 3), (244: 2), (245: 8), (252: 3), (294: 2), (299: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 67 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
