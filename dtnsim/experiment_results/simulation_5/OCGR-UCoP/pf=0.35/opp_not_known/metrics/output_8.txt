The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1541(1 to 12), 1542(12 to 5), 1561(7 to 3), 1562(10 to 6), 1563(11 to 1), 1571(6 to 7), 1614(3 to 4), 1616(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1541: 80.000000), (1542: 50.000000), (1571: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1541: 3), (1542: 4), (1561: 1), (1562: 4), (1563: 4), (1571: 5), (1614: 1), (1616: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
