The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
230(1 to 12), 231(12 to 5), 248(7 to 3), 249(10 to 6), 250(11 to 1), 256(6 to 7), 300(3 to 4), 305(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(230: 80.000000), (231: 50.000000), (250: 25.000000), (256: 5.000000), (300: 10.000000), (305: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(230: 3), (231: 4), (248: 1), (249: 4), (250: 5), (256: 5), (300: 2), (305: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 66 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
