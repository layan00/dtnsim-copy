The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 12), 225(12 to 5), 244(7 to 3), 245(10 to 6), 246(11 to 1), 259(6 to 7), 296(3 to 4), 302(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 80.000000), (225: 50.000000), (246: 5.000000), (302: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 3), (225: 4), (244: 3), (245: 4), (246: 4), (259: 6), (296: 2), (302: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
