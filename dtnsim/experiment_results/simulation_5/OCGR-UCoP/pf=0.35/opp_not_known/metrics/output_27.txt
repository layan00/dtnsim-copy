The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1092(1 to 12), 1093(12 to 5), 1111(7 to 3), 1112(10 to 6), 1113(11 to 1), 1118(6 to 7), 1153(3 to 4), 1161(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1092: 80.000000), (1111: 25.000000), (1112: 45.000000), (1153: 10.000000), (1161: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1092: 3), (1093: 1), (1111: 3), (1112: 5), (1113: 5), (1118: 3), (1153: 2), (1161: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 71 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
