The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1528(1 to 12), 1529(12 to 5), 1546(7 to 3), 1547(10 to 6), 1548(11 to 1), 1558(6 to 7), 1603(3 to 4), 1605(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1529: 40.000000), (1547: 15.000000), (1558: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1528: 3), (1529: 3), (1546: 3), (1547: 5), (1548: 2), (1558: 5), (1603: 1), (1605: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 108 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
