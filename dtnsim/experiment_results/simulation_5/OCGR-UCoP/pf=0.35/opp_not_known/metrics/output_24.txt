The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1962(1 to 12), 1963(12 to 5), 1979(7 to 3), 1980(10 to 6), 1981(11 to 1), 1990(6 to 7), 2030(3 to 4), 2041(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1962: 80.000000), (1979: 25.000000), (1980: 65.000000), (1981: 25.000000), (1990: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1962: 3), (1963: 4), (1979: 3), (1980: 4), (1981: 5), (1990: 10), (2030: 1), (2041: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 123 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
