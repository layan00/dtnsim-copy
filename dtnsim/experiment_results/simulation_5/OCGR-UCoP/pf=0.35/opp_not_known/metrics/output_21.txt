The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(1 to 12), 665(12 to 5), 682(7 to 3), 683(10 to 6), 684(11 to 1), 695(6 to 7), 734(3 to 4), 736(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(665: 40.000000), (683: 15.000000), (734: 10.000000), (736: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(664: 3), (665: 3), (682: 1), (683: 4), (684: 4), (695: 1), (734: 2), (736: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
