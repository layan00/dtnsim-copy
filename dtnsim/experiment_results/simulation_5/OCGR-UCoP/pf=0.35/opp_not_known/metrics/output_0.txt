The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
234(1 to 12), 235(12 to 5), 256(7 to 3), 257(10 to 6), 258(11 to 1), 269(6 to 7), 315(3 to 4), 321(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 80.000000), (235: 30.000000), (256: 25.000000), (257: 15.000000), (258: 25.000000), (269: 5.000000), (315: 10.000000), (321: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(234: 3), (235: 4), (256: 3), (257: 4), (258: 5), (269: 5), (315: 2), (321: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 74 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
