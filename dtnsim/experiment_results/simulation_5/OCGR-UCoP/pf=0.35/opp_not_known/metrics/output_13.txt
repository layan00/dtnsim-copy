The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1537(1 to 12), 1538(12 to 5), 1555(7 to 3), 1556(10 to 6), 1557(11 to 1), 1563(6 to 7), 1607(3 to 4), 1612(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1538: 40.000000), (1555: 25.000000), (1556: 15.000000), (1612: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1537: 3), (1538: 3), (1555: 3), (1556: 5), (1557: 2), (1563: 1), (1607: 2), (1612: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 72 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
