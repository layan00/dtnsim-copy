The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1563(1 to 12), 1564(12 to 5), 1584(7 to 3), 1585(10 to 6), 1586(11 to 1), 1597(6 to 7), 1633(3 to 4), 1638(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1563: 80.000000), (1586: 5.000000), (1633: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1563: 3), (1564: 6), (1584: 3), (1585: 5), (1586: 4), (1597: 3), (1633: 2), (1638: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 93 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
