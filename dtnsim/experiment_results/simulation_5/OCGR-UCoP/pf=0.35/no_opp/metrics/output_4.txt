The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
636(1 to 12), 637(12 to 5), 645(7 to 3), 646(10 to 6), 647(11 to 1), 657(6 to 7), 668(3 to 4), 672(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(636: 80.000000), (637: 70.000000), (645: 45.000000), (647: 5.000000), (672: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 7), (637: 3), (645: 4), (646: 6), (647: 4), (657: 2), (668: 1), (672: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
