The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(1 to 12), 82(12 to 5), 89(7 to 3), 90(10 to 6), 91(11 to 1), 98(6 to 7), 108(3 to 4), 111(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(90: 65.000000), (108: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 5), (82: 3), (89: 3), (90: 4), (91: 2), (98: 1), (108: 2), (111: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
