The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
606(1 to 12), 607(12 to 5), 614(7 to 3), 615(10 to 6), 616(11 to 1), 625(6 to 7), 635(3 to 4), 637(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(615: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(606: 5), (607: 5), (614: 3), (615: 4), (616: 4), (625: 2), (635: 2), (637: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
