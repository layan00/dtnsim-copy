The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
459(1 to 12), 460(12 to 5), 466(7 to 3), 467(10 to 6), 468(11 to 1), 476(6 to 7), 487(3 to 4), 491(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(459: 80.000000), (460: 70.000000), (466: 45.000000), (467: 45.000000), (487: 10.000000), (491: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(459: 5), (460: 3), (466: 4), (467: 6), (468: 2), (476: 4), (487: 2), (491: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
