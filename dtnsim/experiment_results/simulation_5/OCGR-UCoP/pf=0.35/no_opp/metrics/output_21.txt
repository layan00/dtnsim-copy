The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 12), 219(12 to 5), 222(7 to 3), 223(10 to 6), 224(11 to 1), 236(6 to 7), 252(3 to 4), 254(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 40.000000), (223: 15.000000), (252: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 4), (219: 4), (222: 3), (223: 4), (224: 4), (236: 1), (252: 2), (254: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
