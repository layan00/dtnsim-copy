The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
503(1 to 12), 504(12 to 5), 509(7 to 3), 510(10 to 6), 511(11 to 1), 522(6 to 7), 534(3 to 4), 538(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(511: 5.000000), (534: 10.000000), (538: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(503: 4), (504: 2), (509: 4), (510: 5), (511: 4), (522: 3), (534: 2), (538: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
