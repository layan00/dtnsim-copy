The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
490(1 to 12), 491(12 to 5), 501(7 to 3), 502(10 to 6), 503(11 to 1), 513(6 to 7), 530(3 to 4), 531(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(490: 30.000000), (491: 70.000000), (513: 5.000000), (531: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(490: 5), (491: 3), (501: 2), (502: 4), (503: 4), (513: 5), (530: 1), (531: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
