The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(1 to 12), 210(12 to 5), 213(7 to 3), 214(10 to 6), 215(11 to 1), 226(6 to 7), 237(3 to 4), 238(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 4), (210: 2), (213: 3), (214: 5), (215: 2), (226: 3), (237: 1), (238: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
