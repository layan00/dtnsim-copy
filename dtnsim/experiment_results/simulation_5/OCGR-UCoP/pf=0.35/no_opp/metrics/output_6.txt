The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 12), 218(12 to 5), 225(7 to 3), 226(10 to 6), 227(11 to 1), 240(6 to 7), 255(3 to 4), 257(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 70.000000), (225: 25.000000), (226: 15.000000), (257: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 4), (218: 3), (225: 3), (226: 4), (227: 4), (240: 3), (255: 1), (257: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
