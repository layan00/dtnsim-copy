The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
83(1 to 12), 84(12 to 5), 86(7 to 3), 87(10 to 6), 88(11 to 1), 96(6 to 7), 110(3 to 4), 113(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(86: 25.000000), (110: 10.000000), (113: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(83: 2), (84: 2), (86: 3), (87: 3), (88: 4), (96: 3), (110: 2), (113: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
