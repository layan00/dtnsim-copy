The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
333(1 to 12), 334(12 to 5), 339(7 to 3), 340(10 to 6), 341(11 to 1), 351(6 to 7), 365(3 to 4), 369(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(333: 80.000000), (339: 25.000000), (365: 10.000000), (369: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(333: 4), (334: 2), (339: 3), (340: 6), (341: 4), (351: 4), (365: 2), (369: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
