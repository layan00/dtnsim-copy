The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 12), 81(12 to 5), 87(7 to 3), 88(10 to 6), 89(11 to 1), 103(6 to 7), 114(3 to 4), 118(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(87: 25.000000), (89: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 3), (81: 3), (87: 4), (88: 4), (89: 4), (103: 2), (114: 2), (118: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
