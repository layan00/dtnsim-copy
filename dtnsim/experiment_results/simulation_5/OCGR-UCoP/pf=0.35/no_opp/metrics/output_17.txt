The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
329(1 to 12), 330(12 to 5), 336(7 to 3), 337(10 to 6), 338(11 to 1), 348(6 to 7), 360(3 to 4), 364(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(330: 70.000000), (336: 25.000000), (337: 15.000000), (360: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(329: 2), (330: 3), (336: 3), (337: 4), (338: 5), (348: 1), (360: 2), (364: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
