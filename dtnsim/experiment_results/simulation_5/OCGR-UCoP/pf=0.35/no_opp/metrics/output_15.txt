The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 12), 81(12 to 5), 86(7 to 3), 87(10 to 6), 88(11 to 1), 92(6 to 7), 108(3 to 4), 111(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 80.000000), (88: 25.000000), (108: 10.000000), (111: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 5), (81: 3), (86: 2), (87: 6), (88: 4), (92: 2), (108: 2), (111: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
