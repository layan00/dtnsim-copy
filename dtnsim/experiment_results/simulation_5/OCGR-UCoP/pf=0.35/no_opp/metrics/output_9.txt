The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
622(1 to 12), 623(12 to 5), 627(7 to 3), 628(10 to 6), 629(11 to 1), 643(6 to 7), 657(3 to 4), 661(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(622: 80.000000), (627: 25.000000), (629: 5.000000), (661: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(622: 4), (623: 2), (627: 3), (628: 6), (629: 4), (643: 4), (657: 2), (661: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
