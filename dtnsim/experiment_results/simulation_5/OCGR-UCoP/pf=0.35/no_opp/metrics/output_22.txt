The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
348(1 to 12), 349(12 to 5), 351(7 to 3), 352(10 to 6), 353(11 to 1), 363(6 to 7), 378(3 to 4), 380(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(348: 80.000000), (352: 15.000000), (378: 10.000000), (380: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(348: 4), (349: 2), (351: 3), (352: 4), (353: 2), (363: 3), (378: 2), (380: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
