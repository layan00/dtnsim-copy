The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
86(1 to 12), 87(12 to 5), 94(7 to 3), 95(10 to 6), 96(11 to 1), 104(6 to 7), 122(3 to 4), 126(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(86: 30.000000), (96: 25.000000), (104: 5.000000), (122: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(86: 5), (87: 2), (94: 2), (95: 4), (96: 5), (104: 5), (122: 2), (126: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
