The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 12), 207(12 to 5), 212(7 to 3), 213(10 to 6), 214(11 to 1), 220(6 to 7), 230(3 to 4), 233(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 70.000000), (212: 45.000000), (213: 45.000000), (233: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 2), (207: 3), (212: 4), (213: 6), (214: 2), (220: 2), (230: 1), (233: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
