The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(1 to 12), 482(12 to 5), 489(7 to 3), 490(10 to 6), 491(11 to 1), 501(6 to 7), 514(3 to 4), 515(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(481: 30.000000), (490: 15.000000), (515: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 5), (482: 2), (489: 2), (490: 5), (491: 2), (501: 3), (514: 1), (515: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
