The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
616(1 to 12), 617(12 to 5), 621(7 to 3), 622(10 to 6), 623(11 to 1), 633(6 to 7), 647(3 to 4), 648(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(616: 80.000000), (622: 65.000000), (648: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(616: 5), (617: 2), (621: 3), (622: 4), (623: 4), (633: 4), (647: 1), (648: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
