The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
375(1 to 12), 376(12 to 5), 384(7 to 3), 385(10 to 6), 386(11 to 1), 397(6 to 7), 407(3 to 4), 410(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(376: 70.000000), (385: 65.000000), (407: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(375: 4), (376: 3), (384: 3), (385: 4), (386: 5), (397: 4), (407: 2), (410: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
