The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
594(1 to 12), 595(12 to 5), 600(7 to 3), 601(10 to 6), 602(11 to 1), 616(6 to 7), 630(3 to 4), 633(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(594: 80.000000), (600: 25.000000), (601: 15.000000), (602: 5.000000), (633: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(594: 4), (595: 2), (600: 3), (601: 4), (602: 4), (616: 3), (630: 2), (633: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
