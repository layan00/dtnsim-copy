The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
90(1 to 12), 91(12 to 5), 100(7 to 3), 101(10 to 6), 102(11 to 1), 114(6 to 7), 136(3 to 4), 139(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(90: 30.000000), (100: 25.000000), (101: 15.000000), (114: 5.000000), (136: 10.000000), (139: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(90: 5), (91: 3), (100: 3), (101: 4), (102: 2), (114: 5), (136: 2), (139: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 72 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
