The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
476(1 to 12), 477(12 to 5), 484(7 to 3), 485(10 to 6), 486(11 to 1), 492(6 to 7), 509(3 to 4), 514(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(484: 25.000000), (485: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(476: 4), (477: 2), (484: 4), (485: 5), (486: 2), (492: 1), (509: 2), (514: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
