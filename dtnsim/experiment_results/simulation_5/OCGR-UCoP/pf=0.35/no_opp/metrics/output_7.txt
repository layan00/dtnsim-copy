The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
355(1 to 12), 356(12 to 5), 360(7 to 3), 361(10 to 6), 362(11 to 1), 373(6 to 7), 388(3 to 4), 392(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(360: 25.000000), (373: 5.000000), (392: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(355: 2), (356: 3), (360: 4), (361: 4), (362: 5), (373: 5), (388: 1), (392: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
