The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1823(1 to 12), 1824(12 to 5), 1840(7 to 3), 1841(10 to 6), 1842(11 to 1), 1847(6 to 7), 1880(3 to 4), 1884(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1823: 80.000000), (1824: 50.000000), (1842: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1823: 3), (1824: 4), (1840: 1), (1841: 5), (1842: 5), (1847: 1), (1880: 1), (1884: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 86 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
