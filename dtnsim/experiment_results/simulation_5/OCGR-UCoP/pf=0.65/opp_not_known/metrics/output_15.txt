The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 12), 216(12 to 5), 232(7 to 3), 233(10 to 6), 234(11 to 1), 236(6 to 7), 278(3 to 4), 279(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 80.000000), (234: 15.000000), (279: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 3), (216: 1), (232: 1), (233: 4), (234: 8), (236: 5), (278: 1), (279: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 91 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
