The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
622(1 to 12), 623(12 to 5), 638(7 to 3), 639(10 to 6), 640(11 to 1), 642(6 to 7), 675(3 to 4), 679(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(622: 80.000000), (640: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(622: 3), (623: 1), (638: 1), (639: 2), (640: 5), (642: 5), (675: 1), (679: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 117 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
