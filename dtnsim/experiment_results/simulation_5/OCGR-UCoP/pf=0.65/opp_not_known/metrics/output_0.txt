The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 12), 215(12 to 5), 233(7 to 3), 234(10 to 6), 235(11 to 1), 243(6 to 7), 272(3 to 4), 277(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(272: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 3), (215: 2), (233: 4), (234: 4), (235: 5), (243: 1), (272: 2), (277: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 31 calls to RUCoP, which took 180 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
