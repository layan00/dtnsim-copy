The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1413(1 to 12), 1414(12 to 5), 1431(7 to 3), 1432(10 to 6), 1433(11 to 1), 1439(6 to 7), 1475(3 to 4), 1477(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1414: 40.000000), (1432: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1413: 3), (1414: 3), (1431: 3), (1432: 5), (1433: 2), (1439: 1), (1475: 1), (1477: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
