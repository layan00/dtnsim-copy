The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 12), 207(12 to 5), 223(7 to 3), 224(10 to 6), 225(11 to 1), 229(6 to 7), 259(3 to 4), 262(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(262: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 3), (207: 1), (223: 1), (224: 4), (225: 5), (229: 5), (259: 1), (262: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 126 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
