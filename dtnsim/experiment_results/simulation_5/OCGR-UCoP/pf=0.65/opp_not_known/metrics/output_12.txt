The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1039(1 to 12), 1040(12 to 5), 1056(7 to 3), 1057(10 to 6), 1058(11 to 1), 1061(6 to 7), 1090(3 to 4), 1094(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1039: 80.000000), (1090: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1039: 3), (1040: 1), (1056: 1), (1057: 4), (1058: 5), (1061: 1), (1090: 2), (1094: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
