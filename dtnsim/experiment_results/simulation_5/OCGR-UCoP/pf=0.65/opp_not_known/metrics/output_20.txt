The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(1 to 12), 222(12 to 5), 242(7 to 3), 243(10 to 6), 244(11 to 1), 249(6 to 7), 284(3 to 4), 290(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 80.000000), (222: 50.000000), (244: 25.000000), (290: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 3), (222: 6), (242: 1), (243: 4), (244: 5), (249: 3), (284: 2), (290: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 56 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
