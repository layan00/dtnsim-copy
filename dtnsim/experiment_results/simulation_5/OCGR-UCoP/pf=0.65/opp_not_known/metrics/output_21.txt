The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
636(1 to 12), 637(12 to 5), 654(7 to 3), 655(10 to 6), 656(11 to 1), 664(6 to 7), 695(3 to 4), 699(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(637: 50.000000), (655: 65.000000), (695: 10.000000), (699: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 3), (637: 5), (654: 1), (655: 4), (656: 4), (664: 1), (695: 2), (699: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 77 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
