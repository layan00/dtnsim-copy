The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
619(1 to 12), 620(12 to 5), 636(7 to 3), 637(10 to 6), 638(11 to 1), 643(6 to 7), 675(3 to 4), 677(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(675: 10.000000), (677: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(619: 3), (620: 2), (636: 1), (637: 3), (638: 2), (643: 3), (675: 2), (677: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 87 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
