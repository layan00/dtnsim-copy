The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1464(1 to 12), 1465(12 to 5), 1481(7 to 3), 1482(10 to 6), 1483(11 to 1), 1487(6 to 7), 1513(3 to 4), 1514(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1464: 80.000000), (1482: 65.000000), (1514: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1464: 3), (1465: 1), (1481: 1), (1482: 4), (1483: 2), (1487: 1), (1513: 1), (1514: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 63 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
