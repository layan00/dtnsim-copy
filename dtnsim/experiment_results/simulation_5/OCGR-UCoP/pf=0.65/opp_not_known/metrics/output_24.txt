The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1865(1 to 12), 1866(12 to 5), 1881(7 to 3), 1882(10 to 6), 1883(11 to 1), 1888(6 to 7), 1916(3 to 4), 1922(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1865: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1865: 3), (1866: 1), (1881: 1), (1882: 7), (1883: 5), (1888: 1), (1916: 1), (1922: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 25 calls to RUCoP, which took 143 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
