The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1023(1 to 12), 1024(12 to 5), 1041(7 to 3), 1042(10 to 6), 1043(11 to 1), 1050(6 to 7), 1080(3 to 4), 1084(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1023: 3), (1024: 1), (1041: 3), (1042: 6), (1043: 2), (1050: 1), (1080: 1), (1084: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 135 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
