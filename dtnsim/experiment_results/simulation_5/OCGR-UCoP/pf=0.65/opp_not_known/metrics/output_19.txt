The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1816(1 to 12), 1817(12 to 5), 1833(7 to 3), 1834(10 to 6), 1835(11 to 1), 1839(6 to 7), 1867(3 to 4), 1871(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1835: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1816: 3), (1817: 1), (1833: 1), (1834: 4), (1835: 5), (1839: 1), (1867: 1), (1871: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
