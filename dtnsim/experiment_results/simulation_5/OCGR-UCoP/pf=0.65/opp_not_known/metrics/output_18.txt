The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1414(1 to 12), 1415(12 to 5), 1431(7 to 3), 1432(10 to 6), 1433(11 to 1), 1439(6 to 7), 1469(3 to 4), 1474(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1414: 80.000000), (1431: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1414: 3), (1415: 1), (1431: 3), (1432: 5), (1433: 5), (1439: 3), (1469: 1), (1474: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 117 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
