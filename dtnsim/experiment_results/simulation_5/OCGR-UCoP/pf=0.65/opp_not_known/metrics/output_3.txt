The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1408(1 to 12), 1409(12 to 5), 1424(7 to 3), 1425(10 to 6), 1426(11 to 1), 1429(6 to 7), 1464(3 to 4), 1470(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1426: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1408: 3), (1409: 1), (1424: 3), (1425: 4), (1426: 5), (1429: 6), (1464: 2), (1470: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 125 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
