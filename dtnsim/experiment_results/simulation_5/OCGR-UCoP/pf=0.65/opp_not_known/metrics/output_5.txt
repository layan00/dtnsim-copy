The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 12), 211(12 to 5), 229(7 to 3), 230(10 to 6), 231(11 to 1), 235(6 to 7), 276(3 to 4), 279(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 15.000000), (276: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 3), (211: 6), (229: 1), (230: 5), (231: 8), (235: 3), (276: 2), (279: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 80 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
