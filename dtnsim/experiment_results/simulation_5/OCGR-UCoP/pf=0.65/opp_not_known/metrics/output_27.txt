The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1007(1 to 12), 1008(12 to 5), 1026(7 to 3), 1027(10 to 6), 1028(11 to 1), 1032(6 to 7), 1064(3 to 4), 1068(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1007: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1007: 3), (1008: 1), (1026: 1), (1027: 5), (1028: 5), (1032: 1), (1064: 2), (1068: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 100 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
