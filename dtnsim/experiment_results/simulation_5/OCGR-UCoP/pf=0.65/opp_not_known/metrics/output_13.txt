The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1448(1 to 12), 1449(12 to 5), 1465(7 to 3), 1466(10 to 6), 1467(11 to 1), 1470(6 to 7), 1506(3 to 4), 1512(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1449: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1448: 3), (1449: 4), (1465: 3), (1466: 3), (1467: 2), (1470: 1), (1506: 2), (1512: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 107 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
