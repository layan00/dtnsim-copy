The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
620(1 to 12), 621(12 to 5), 637(7 to 3), 638(10 to 6), 639(11 to 1), 647(6 to 7), 679(3 to 4), 682(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(682: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(620: 3), (621: 1), (637: 1), (638: 6), (639: 2), (647: 3), (679: 1), (682: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
