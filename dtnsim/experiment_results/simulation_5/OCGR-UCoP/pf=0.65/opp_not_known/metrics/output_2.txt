The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1017(1 to 12), 1018(12 to 5), 1037(7 to 3), 1038(10 to 6), 1039(11 to 1), 1044(6 to 7), 1070(3 to 4), 1075(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1017: 3), (1018: 6), (1037: 1), (1038: 6), (1039: 2), (1044: 1), (1070: 2), (1075: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 127 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
