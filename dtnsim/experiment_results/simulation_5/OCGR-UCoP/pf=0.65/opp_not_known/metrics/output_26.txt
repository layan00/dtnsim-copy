The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
601(1 to 12), 602(12 to 5), 619(7 to 3), 620(10 to 6), 621(11 to 1), 624(6 to 7), 653(3 to 4), 659(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(619: 45.000000), (659: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(601: 3), (602: 1), (619: 3), (620: 5), (621: 5), (624: 1), (653: 1), (659: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 132 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
