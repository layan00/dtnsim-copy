The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
449(1 to 12), 450(12 to 5), 452(7 to 3), 453(10 to 6), 454(11 to 1), 459(6 to 7), 468(3 to 4), 471(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(450: 50.000000), (471: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(449: 2), (450: 5), (452: 2), (453: 5), (454: 5), (459: 1), (468: 1), (471: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
