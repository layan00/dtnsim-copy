The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(1 to 12), 71(12 to 5), 76(7 to 3), 77(10 to 6), 78(11 to 1), 84(6 to 7), 89(3 to 4), 90(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(77: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 4), (71: 3), (76: 3), (77: 4), (78: 4), (84: 1), (89: 1), (90: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 70: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
