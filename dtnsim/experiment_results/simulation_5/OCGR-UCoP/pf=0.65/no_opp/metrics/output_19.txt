The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
452(1 to 12), 453(12 to 5), 455(7 to 3), 456(10 to 6), 457(11 to 1), 461(6 to 7), 465(3 to 4), 466(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(452: 2), (453: 2), (455: 2), (456: 4), (457: 2), (461: 1), (465: 1), (466: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
