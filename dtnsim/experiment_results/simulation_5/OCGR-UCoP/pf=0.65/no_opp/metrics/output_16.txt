The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(1 to 12), 173(12 to 5), 174(7 to 3), 175(10 to 6), 176(11 to 1), 178(6 to 7), 185(3 to 4), 186(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(186: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 2), (173: 2), (174: 2), (175: 3), (176: 2), (178: 2), (185: 1), (186: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 172: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
