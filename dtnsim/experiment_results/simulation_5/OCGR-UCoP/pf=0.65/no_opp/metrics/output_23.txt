The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
403(1 to 12), 404(12 to 5), 407(7 to 3), 408(10 to 6), 409(11 to 1), 413(6 to 7), 415(3 to 4), 416(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(403: 80.000000), (408: 65.000000), (416: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(403: 4), (404: 2), (407: 2), (408: 4), (409: 2), (413: 1), (415: 1), (416: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
