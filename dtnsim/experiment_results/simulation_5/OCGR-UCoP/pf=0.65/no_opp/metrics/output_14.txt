The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
483(1 to 12), 484(12 to 5), 486(7 to 3), 487(10 to 6), 488(11 to 1), 494(6 to 7), 503(3 to 4), 505(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(483: 4), (484: 5), (486: 3), (487: 3), (488: 4), (494: 2), (503: 2), (505: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
