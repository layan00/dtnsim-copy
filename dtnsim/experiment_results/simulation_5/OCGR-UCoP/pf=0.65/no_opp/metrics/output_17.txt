The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
260(1 to 12), 261(12 to 5), 264(7 to 3), 265(10 to 6), 266(11 to 1), 268(6 to 7), 272(3 to 4), 275(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(272: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(260: 2), (261: 2), (264: 4), (265: 3), (266: 2), (268: 1), (272: 2), (275: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 260: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
