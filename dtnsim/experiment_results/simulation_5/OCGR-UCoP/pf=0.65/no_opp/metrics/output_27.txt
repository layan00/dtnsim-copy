The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
254(1 to 12), 255(12 to 5), 261(7 to 3), 262(10 to 6), 263(11 to 1), 267(6 to 7), 275(3 to 4), 277(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(254: 2), (255: 3), (261: 2), (262: 5), (263: 2), (267: 1), (275: 2), (277: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
