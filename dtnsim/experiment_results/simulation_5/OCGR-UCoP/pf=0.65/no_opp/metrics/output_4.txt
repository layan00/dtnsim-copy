The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
444(1 to 12), 445(12 to 5), 449(7 to 3), 450(10 to 6), 451(11 to 1), 453(6 to 7), 460(3 to 4), 462(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(449: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(444: 4), (445: 2), (449: 4), (450: 3), (451: 2), (453: 1), (460: 1), (462: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 444: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
