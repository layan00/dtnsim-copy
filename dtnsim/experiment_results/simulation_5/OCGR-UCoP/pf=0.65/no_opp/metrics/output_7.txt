The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
263(1 to 12), 264(12 to 5), 267(7 to 3), 268(10 to 6), 269(11 to 1), 277(6 to 7), 283(3 to 4), 285(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(263: 2), (264: 2), (267: 4), (268: 3), (269: 2), (277: 1), (283: 1), (285: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
