The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
356(1 to 12), 357(12 to 5), 362(7 to 3), 363(10 to 6), 364(11 to 1), 370(6 to 7), 379(3 to 4), 381(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(363: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(356: 3), (357: 2), (362: 4), (363: 5), (364: 2), (370: 1), (379: 1), (381: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
