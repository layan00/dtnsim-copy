The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
163(1 to 12), 164(12 to 5), 167(7 to 3), 168(10 to 6), 169(11 to 1), 178(6 to 7), 187(3 to 4), 188(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(163: 3), (164: 2), (167: 3), (168: 3), (169: 2), (178: 3), (187: 1), (188: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
