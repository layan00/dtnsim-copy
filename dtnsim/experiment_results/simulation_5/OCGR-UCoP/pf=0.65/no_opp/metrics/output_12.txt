The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
279(1 to 12), 280(12 to 5), 283(7 to 3), 284(10 to 6), 285(11 to 1), 289(6 to 7), 294(3 to 4), 296(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(294: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(279: 2), (280: 2), (283: 3), (284: 4), (285: 2), (289: 1), (294: 2), (296: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
