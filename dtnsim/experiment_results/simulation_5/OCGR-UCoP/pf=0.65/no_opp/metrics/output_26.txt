The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
150(1 to 12), 151(12 to 5), 154(7 to 3), 155(10 to 6), 156(11 to 1), 159(6 to 7), 164(3 to 4), 167(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(154: 45.000000), (155: 45.000000), (167: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(150: 4), (151: 2), (154: 4), (155: 5), (156: 2), (159: 1), (164: 1), (167: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 150: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
