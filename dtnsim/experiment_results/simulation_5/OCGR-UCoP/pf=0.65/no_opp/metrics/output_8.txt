The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
357(1 to 12), 358(12 to 5), 362(7 to 3), 363(10 to 6), 364(11 to 1), 368(6 to 7), 373(3 to 4), 374(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(374: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(357: 4), (358: 2), (362: 2), (363: 4), (364: 2), (368: 2), (373: 1), (374: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
