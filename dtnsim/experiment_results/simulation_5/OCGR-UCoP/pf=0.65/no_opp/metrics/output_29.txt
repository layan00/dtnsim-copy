The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
459(1 to 12), 460(12 to 5), 466(7 to 3), 467(10 to 6), 468(11 to 1), 479(6 to 7), 487(3 to 4), 490(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(459: 30.000000), (466: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(459: 5), (460: 2), (466: 4), (467: 4), (468: 2), (479: 3), (487: 1), (490: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
