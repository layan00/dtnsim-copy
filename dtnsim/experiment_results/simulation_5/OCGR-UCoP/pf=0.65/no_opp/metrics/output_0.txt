The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(1 to 12), 71(12 to 5), 75(7 to 3), 76(10 to 6), 77(11 to 1), 85(6 to 7), 90(3 to 4), 93(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(90: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 2), (71: 2), (75: 4), (76: 4), (77: 2), (85: 1), (90: 2), (93: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 70: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
