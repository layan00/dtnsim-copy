The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
186(1 to 12), 187(12 to 5), 190(7 to 3), 191(10 to 6), 192(11 to 1), 201(6 to 7), 208(3 to 4), 211(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(191: 65.000000), (208: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 3), (187: 3), (190: 4), (191: 4), (192: 4), (201: 1), (208: 2), (211: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
