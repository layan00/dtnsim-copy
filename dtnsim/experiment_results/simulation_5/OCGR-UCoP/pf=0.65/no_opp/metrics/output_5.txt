The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(1 to 12), 67(12 to 5), 69(7 to 3), 70(10 to 6), 71(11 to 1), 75(6 to 7), 86(3 to 4), 88(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(86: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 2), (67: 2), (69: 2), (70: 3), (71: 4), (75: 3), (86: 2), (88: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
