The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
169(1 to 12), 170(12 to 5), 172(7 to 3), 173(10 to 6), 174(11 to 1), 179(6 to 7), 187(3 to 4), 189(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(187: 10.000000), (189: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(169: 4), (170: 2), (172: 2), (173: 3), (174: 2), (179: 3), (187: 2), (189: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 169: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
