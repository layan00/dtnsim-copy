The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
71(1 to 12), 72(12 to 5), 75(7 to 3), 76(10 to 6), 77(11 to 1), 79(6 to 7), 89(3 to 4), 91(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(71: 80.000000), (77: 25.000000), (91: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(71: 5), (72: 2), (75: 2), (76: 4), (77: 4), (79: 2), (89: 1), (91: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
