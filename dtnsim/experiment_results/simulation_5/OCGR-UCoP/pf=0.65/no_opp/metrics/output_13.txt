The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
384(1 to 12), 385(12 to 5), 390(7 to 3), 391(10 to 6), 392(11 to 1), 395(6 to 7), 406(3 to 4), 411(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(384: 5), (385: 2), (390: 4), (391: 3), (392: 2), (395: 1), (406: 2), (411: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
