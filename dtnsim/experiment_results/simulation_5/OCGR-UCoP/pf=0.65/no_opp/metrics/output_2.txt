The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
266(1 to 12), 267(12 to 5), 270(7 to 3), 271(10 to 6), 272(11 to 1), 278(6 to 7), 280(3 to 4), 282(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(266: 2), (267: 2), (270: 3), (271: 3), (272: 2), (278: 1), (280: 2), (282: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
