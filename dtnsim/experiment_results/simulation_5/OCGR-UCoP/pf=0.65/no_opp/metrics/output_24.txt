The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
504(1 to 12), 505(12 to 5), 508(7 to 3), 509(10 to 6), 510(11 to 1), 515(6 to 7), 519(3 to 4), 520(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(504: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(504: 5), (505: 2), (508: 2), (509: 3), (510: 2), (515: 1), (519: 1), (520: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 504: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
