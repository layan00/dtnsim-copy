The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
793(1 to 12), 794(12 to 5), 798(7 to 3), 799(10 to 6), 800(11 to 1), 805(6 to 7), 834(3 to 4), 844(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(793: 40.000000), (800: 25.000000), (834: 10.000000), (844: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(793: 6), (794: 2), (798: 3), (799: 2), (800: 4), (805: 11), (834: 2), (844: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
