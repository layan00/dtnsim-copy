The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1337(1 to 12), 1338(12 to 5), 1343(7 to 3), 1344(10 to 6), 1345(11 to 1), 1352(6 to 7), 1372(3 to 4), 1377(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1343: 25.000000), (1377: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1337: 4), (1338: 2), (1343: 4), (1344: 2), (1345: 4), (1352: 3), (1372: 1), (1377: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
