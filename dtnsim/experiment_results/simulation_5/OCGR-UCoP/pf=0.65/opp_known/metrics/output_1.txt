The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
485(1 to 12), 486(12 to 5), 490(7 to 3), 491(10 to 6), 492(11 to 1), 496(6 to 7), 520(3 to 4), 524(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(485: 40.000000), (520: 10.000000), (524: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(485: 6), (486: 2), (490: 2), (491: 2), (492: 4), (496: 3), (520: 2), (524: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
