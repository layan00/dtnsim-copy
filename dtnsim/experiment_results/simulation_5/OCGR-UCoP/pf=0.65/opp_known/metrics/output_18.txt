The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1042(1 to 12), 1043(12 to 5), 1047(7 to 3), 1048(10 to 6), 1049(11 to 1), 1054(6 to 7), 1075(3 to 4), 1079(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1047: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1042: 6), (1043: 2), (1047: 4), (1048: 2), (1049: 4), (1054: 3), (1075: 1), (1079: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
