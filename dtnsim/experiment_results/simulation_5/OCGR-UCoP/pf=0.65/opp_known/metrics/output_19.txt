The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1323(1 to 12), 1324(12 to 5), 1328(7 to 3), 1329(10 to 6), 1330(11 to 1), 1334(6 to 7), 1350(3 to 4), 1354(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1330: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1323: 4), (1324: 2), (1328: 2), (1329: 3), (1330: 4), (1334: 1), (1350: 1), (1354: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
