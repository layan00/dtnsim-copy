The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
468(1 to 12), 469(12 to 5), 474(7 to 3), 475(10 to 6), 476(11 to 1), 479(6 to 7), 498(3 to 4), 502(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(474: 45.000000), (502: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(468: 4), (469: 2), (474: 4), (475: 5), (476: 4), (479: 1), (498: 1), (502: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
