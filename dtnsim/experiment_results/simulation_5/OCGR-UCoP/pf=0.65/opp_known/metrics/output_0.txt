The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 12), 203(12 to 5), 209(7 to 3), 210(10 to 6), 211(11 to 1), 217(6 to 7), 234(3 to 4), 239(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 4), (203: 2), (209: 4), (210: 2), (211: 4), (217: 1), (234: 2), (239: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 73 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
