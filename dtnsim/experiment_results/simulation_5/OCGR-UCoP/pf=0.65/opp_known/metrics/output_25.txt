The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(1 to 12), 195(12 to 5), 199(7 to 3), 200(10 to 6), 201(11 to 1), 204(6 to 7), 222(3 to 4), 225(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 4), (195: 2), (199: 2), (200: 2), (201: 4), (204: 5), (222: 1), (225: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
