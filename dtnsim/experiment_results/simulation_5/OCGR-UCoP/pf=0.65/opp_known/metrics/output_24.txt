The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1379(1 to 12), 1380(12 to 5), 1386(7 to 3), 1387(10 to 6), 1388(11 to 1), 1393(6 to 7), 1411(3 to 4), 1415(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1379: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1379: 4), (1380: 6), (1386: 2), (1387: 6), (1388: 4), (1393: 1), (1411: 1), (1415: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
