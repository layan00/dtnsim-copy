The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
486(1 to 12), 487(12 to 5), 491(7 to 3), 492(10 to 6), 493(11 to 1), 501(6 to 7), 527(3 to 4), 531(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(493: 25.000000), (531: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(486: 6), (487: 2), (491: 3), (492: 5), (493: 4), (501: 3), (527: 1), (531: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
