The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
796(1 to 12), 797(12 to 5), 804(7 to 3), 805(10 to 6), 806(11 to 1), 810(6 to 7), 827(3 to 4), 832(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(796: 80.000000), (827: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(796: 4), (797: 6), (804: 3), (805: 3), (806: 4), (810: 1), (827: 2), (832: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
