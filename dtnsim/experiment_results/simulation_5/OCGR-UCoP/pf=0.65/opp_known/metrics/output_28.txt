The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1043(1 to 12), 1044(12 to 5), 1052(7 to 3), 1053(10 to 6), 1054(11 to 1), 1060(6 to 7), 1087(3 to 4), 1089(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1044: 30.000000), (1053: 15.000000), (1054: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1043: 6), (1044: 4), (1052: 4), (1053: 4), (1054: 3), (1060: 1), (1087: 1), (1089: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
