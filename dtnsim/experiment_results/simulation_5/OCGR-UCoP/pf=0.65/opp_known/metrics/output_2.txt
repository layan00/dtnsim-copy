The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
768(1 to 12), 769(12 to 5), 776(7 to 3), 777(10 to 6), 778(11 to 1), 783(6 to 7), 799(3 to 4), 804(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(768: 4), (769: 6), (776: 3), (777: 5), (778: 4), (783: 1), (799: 2), (804: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
