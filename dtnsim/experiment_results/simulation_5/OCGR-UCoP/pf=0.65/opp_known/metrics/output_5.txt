The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 12), 199(12 to 5), 205(7 to 3), 206(10 to 6), 207(11 to 1), 211(6 to 7), 238(3 to 4), 241(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 15.000000), (238: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 6), (199: 6), (205: 2), (206: 2), (207: 3), (211: 3), (238: 2), (241: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
