The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 12), 203(12 to 5), 210(7 to 3), 211(10 to 6), 212(11 to 1), 219(6 to 7), 238(3 to 4), 239(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 30.000000), (211: 65.000000), (212: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 4), (203: 4), (210: 3), (211: 3), (212: 3), (219: 1), (238: 1), (239: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
