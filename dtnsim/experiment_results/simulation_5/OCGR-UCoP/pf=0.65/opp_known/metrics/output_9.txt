The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1337(1 to 12), 1338(12 to 5), 1342(7 to 3), 1343(10 to 6), 1344(11 to 1), 1349(6 to 7), 1374(3 to 4), 1376(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1337: 80.000000), (1338: 50.000000), (1344: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1337: 4), (1338: 5), (1342: 2), (1343: 5), (1344: 3), (1349: 1), (1374: 1), (1376: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
