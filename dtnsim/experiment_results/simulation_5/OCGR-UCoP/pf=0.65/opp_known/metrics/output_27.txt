The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
754(1 to 12), 755(12 to 5), 764(7 to 3), 765(10 to 6), 766(11 to 1), 769(6 to 7), 789(3 to 4), 795(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(754: 80.000000), (755: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(754: 4), (755: 6), (764: 2), (765: 2), (766: 4), (769: 1), (789: 2), (795: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
