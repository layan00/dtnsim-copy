The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1379(1 to 12), 1380(12 to 5), 1384(7 to 3), 1385(10 to 6), 1386(11 to 1), 1392(6 to 7), 1417(3 to 4), 1420(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1386: 15.000000), (1420: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1379: 4), (1380: 5), (1384: 3), (1385: 2), (1386: 3), (1392: 7), (1417: 2), (1420: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
