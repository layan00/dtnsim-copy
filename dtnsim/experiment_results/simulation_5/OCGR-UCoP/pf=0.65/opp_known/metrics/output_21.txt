The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
503(1 to 12), 504(12 to 5), 509(7 to 3), 510(10 to 6), 511(11 to 1), 516(6 to 7), 535(3 to 4), 543(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(504: 50.000000), (511: 25.000000), (535: 10.000000), (543: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(503: 4), (504: 5), (509: 4), (510: 2), (511: 4), (516: 1), (535: 2), (543: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
