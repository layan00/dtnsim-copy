The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 12), 204(12 to 5), 208(7 to 3), 209(10 to 6), 210(11 to 1), 212(6 to 7), 241(3 to 4), 242(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 40.000000), (210: 15.000000), (242: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 6), (204: 2), (208: 2), (209: 3), (210: 3), (212: 5), (241: 1), (242: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
