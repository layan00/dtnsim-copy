The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
776(1 to 12), 777(12 to 5), 782(7 to 3), 783(10 to 6), 784(11 to 1), 791(6 to 7), 811(3 to 4), 815(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(776: 4), (777: 2), (782: 4), (783: 5), (784: 4), (791: 1), (811: 1), (815: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
