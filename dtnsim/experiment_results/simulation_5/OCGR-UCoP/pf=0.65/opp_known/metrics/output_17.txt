The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
765(1 to 12), 766(12 to 5), 771(7 to 3), 772(10 to 6), 773(11 to 1), 774(6 to 7), 790(3 to 4), 795(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(765: 80.000000), (790: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(765: 4), (766: 2), (771: 4), (772: 2), (773: 4), (774: 1), (790: 2), (795: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
