The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
313(1 to 12), 314(12 to 5), 316(7 to 3), 317(10 to 6), 318(11 to 1), 319(6 to 7), 325(3 to 4), 328(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(316: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(313: 2), (314: 2), (316: 4), (317: 3), (318: 1), (319: 1), (325: 2), (328: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 313: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
