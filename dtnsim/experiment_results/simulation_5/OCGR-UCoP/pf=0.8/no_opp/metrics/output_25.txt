The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
57(1 to 12), 58(12 to 5), 60(7 to 3), 61(10 to 6), 62(11 to 1), 64(6 to 7), 65(3 to 4), 66(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(57: 3), (58: 2), (60: 2), (61: 3), (62: 1), (64: 1), (65: 1), (66: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 57: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 57: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 65: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 64: (to: 9, time: 30.000000), 
Node 7:

Bundle 66: (to: 4, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 66: (to: 7, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10:
