The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
308(1 to 12), 309(12 to 5), 310(7 to 3), 311(10 to 6), 312(11 to 1), 313(6 to 7), 318(3 to 4), 321(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(308: 2), (309: 2), (310: 4), (311: 3), (312: 1), (313: 1), (318: 2), (321: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
