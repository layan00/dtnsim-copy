The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
382(1 to 12), 383(12 to 5), 385(7 to 3), 386(10 to 6), 387(11 to 1), 389(6 to 7), 391(3 to 4), 392(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(382: 2), (383: 2), (385: 2), (386: 4), (387: 1), (389: 1), (391: 1), (392: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
