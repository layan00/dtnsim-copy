The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
396(1 to 12), 397(12 to 5), 400(7 to 3), 401(10 to 6), 402(11 to 1), 408(6 to 7), 412(3 to 4), 414(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(396: 4), (397: 2), (400: 4), (401: 3), (402: 1), (408: 2), (412: 1), (414: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
