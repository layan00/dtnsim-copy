The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
151(1 to 12), 152(12 to 5), 155(7 to 3), 156(10 to 6), 157(11 to 1), 160(6 to 7), 162(3 to 4), 163(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(151: 2), (152: 2), (155: 2), (156: 4), (157: 1), (160: 1), (162: 1), (163: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
