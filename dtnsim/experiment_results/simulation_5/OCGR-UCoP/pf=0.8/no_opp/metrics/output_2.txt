The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
236(1 to 12), 237(12 to 5), 238(7 to 3), 239(10 to 6), 240(11 to 1), 243(6 to 7), 245(3 to 4), 247(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 2), (237: 2), (238: 3), (239: 3), (240: 1), (243: 1), (245: 2), (247: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
