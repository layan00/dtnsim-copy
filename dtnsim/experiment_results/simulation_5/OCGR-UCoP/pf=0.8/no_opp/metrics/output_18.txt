The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
300(1 to 12), 301(12 to 5), 303(7 to 3), 304(10 to 6), 305(11 to 1), 310(6 to 7), 315(3 to 4), 318(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(303: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(300: 2), (301: 2), (303: 4), (304: 5), (305: 1), (310: 3), (315: 1), (318: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 300: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
