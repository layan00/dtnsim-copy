The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
129(1 to 12), 130(12 to 5), 132(7 to 3), 133(10 to 6), 134(11 to 1), 137(6 to 7), 139(3 to 4), 142(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(129: 2), (130: 2), (132: 4), (133: 4), (134: 1), (137: 1), (139: 1), (142: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
