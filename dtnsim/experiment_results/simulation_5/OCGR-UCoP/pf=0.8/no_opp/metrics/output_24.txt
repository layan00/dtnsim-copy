The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
395(1 to 12), 396(12 to 5), 398(7 to 3), 399(10 to 6), 400(11 to 1), 402(6 to 7), 405(3 to 4), 406(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(395: 5), (396: 2), (398: 2), (399: 3), (400: 1), (402: 1), (405: 1), (406: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 395: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
