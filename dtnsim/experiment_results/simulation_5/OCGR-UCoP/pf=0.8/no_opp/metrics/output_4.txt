The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
389(1 to 12), 390(12 to 5), 393(7 to 3), 394(10 to 6), 395(11 to 1), 397(6 to 7), 402(3 to 4), 403(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(389: 4), (390: 2), (393: 2), (394: 3), (395: 1), (397: 1), (402: 1), (403: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
