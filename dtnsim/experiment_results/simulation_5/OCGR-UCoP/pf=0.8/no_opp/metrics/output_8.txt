The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
310(1 to 12), 311(12 to 5), 314(7 to 3), 315(10 to 6), 316(11 to 1), 320(6 to 7), 324(3 to 4), 325(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(310: 4), (311: 2), (314: 2), (315: 4), (316: 1), (320: 2), (324: 1), (325: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 310: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
