The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
62(1 to 12), 63(12 to 5), 65(7 to 3), 66(10 to 6), 67(11 to 1), 70(6 to 7), 77(3 to 4), 79(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(77: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(62: 2), (63: 2), (65: 2), (66: 3), (67: 3), (70: 2), (77: 2), (79: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 62: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
