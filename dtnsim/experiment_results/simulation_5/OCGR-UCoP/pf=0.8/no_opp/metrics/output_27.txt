The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(1 to 12), 214(12 to 5), 218(7 to 3), 219(10 to 6), 220(11 to 1), 223(6 to 7), 230(3 to 4), 232(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 2), (214: 3), (218: 2), (219: 3), (220: 1), (223: 1), (230: 2), (232: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 213: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
