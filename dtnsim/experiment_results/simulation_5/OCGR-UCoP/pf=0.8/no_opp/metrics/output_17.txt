The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(1 to 12), 223(12 to 5), 225(7 to 3), 226(10 to 6), 227(11 to 1), 228(6 to 7), 231(3 to 4), 233(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 2), (223: 2), (225: 2), (226: 3), (227: 1), (228: 1), (231: 2), (233: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 222: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:

Node 3: 
Bundle 231: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6:
