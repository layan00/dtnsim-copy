The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
393(1 to 12), 394(12 to 5), 396(7 to 3), 397(10 to 6), 398(11 to 1), 399(6 to 7), 403(3 to 4), 404(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(393: 4), (394: 3), (396: 2), (397: 3), (398: 1), (399: 1), (403: 1), (404: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
