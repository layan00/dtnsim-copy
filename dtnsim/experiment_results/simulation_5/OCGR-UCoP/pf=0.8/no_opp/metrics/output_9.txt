The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
390(1 to 12), 391(12 to 5), 392(7 to 3), 393(10 to 6), 394(11 to 1), 396(6 to 7), 399(3 to 4), 400(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(400: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(390: 2), (391: 2), (392: 2), (393: 3), (394: 1), (396: 1), (399: 1), (400: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 390: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
