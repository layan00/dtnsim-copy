The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1259(1 to 12), 1260(12 to 5), 1264(7 to 3), 1265(10 to 6), 1266(11 to 1), 1268(6 to 7), 1282(3 to 4), 1285(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1259: 4), (1260: 2), (1264: 2), (1265: 3), (1266: 4), (1268: 1), (1282: 1), (1285: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
