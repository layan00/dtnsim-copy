The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 12), 199(12 to 5), 204(7 to 3), 205(10 to 6), 206(11 to 1), 209(6 to 7), 225(3 to 4), 229(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 4), (199: 2), (204: 2), (205: 2), (206: 4), (209: 1), (225: 2), (229: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 73 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 198: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 225: (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
