The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
740(1 to 12), 741(12 to 5), 748(7 to 3), 749(10 to 6), 750(11 to 1), 751(6 to 7), 767(3 to 4), 772(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(740: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(740: 4), (741: 6), (748: 2), (749: 3), (750: 4), (751: 1), (767: 2), (772: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
