The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
468(1 to 12), 469(12 to 5), 472(7 to 3), 473(10 to 6), 474(11 to 1), 476(6 to 7), 496(3 to 4), 501(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(468: 4), (469: 2), (472: 2), (473: 2), (474: 4), (476: 9), (496: 2), (501: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
