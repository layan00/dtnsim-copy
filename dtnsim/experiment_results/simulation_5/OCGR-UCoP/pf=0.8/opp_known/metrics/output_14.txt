The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1282(1 to 12), 1283(12 to 5), 1287(7 to 3), 1288(10 to 6), 1289(11 to 1), 1290(6 to 7), 1306(3 to 4), 1311(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1283: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1282: 4), (1283: 5), (1287: 2), (1288: 2), (1289: 4), (1290: 1), (1306: 1), (1311: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
