The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1007(1 to 12), 1008(12 to 5), 1015(7 to 3), 1016(10 to 6), 1017(11 to 1), 1020(6 to 7), 1033(3 to 4), 1036(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1007: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1007: 4), (1008: 6), (1015: 2), (1016: 2), (1017: 4), (1020: 1), (1033: 1), (1036: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
