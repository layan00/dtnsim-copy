The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
469(1 to 12), 470(12 to 5), 473(7 to 3), 474(10 to 6), 475(11 to 1), 476(6 to 7), 491(3 to 4), 494(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(469: 4), (470: 2), (473: 2), (474: 2), (475: 4), (476: 1), (491: 1), (494: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
