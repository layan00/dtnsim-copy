The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
997(1 to 12), 998(12 to 5), 1001(7 to 3), 1002(10 to 6), 1003(11 to 1), 1004(6 to 7), 1021(3 to 4), 1026(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(997: 4), (998: 2), (1001: 4), (1002: 2), (1003: 4), (1004: 1), (1021: 2), (1026: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
