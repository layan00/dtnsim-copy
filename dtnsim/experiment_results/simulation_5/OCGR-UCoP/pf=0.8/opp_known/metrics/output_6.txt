The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
472(1 to 12), 473(12 to 5), 477(7 to 3), 478(10 to 6), 479(11 to 1), 484(6 to 7), 502(3 to 4), 506(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(479: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(472: 4), (473: 2), (477: 3), (478: 2), (479: 4), (484: 5), (502: 1), (506: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
