The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
991(1 to 12), 992(12 to 5), 996(7 to 3), 997(10 to 6), 998(11 to 1), 1002(6 to 7), 1022(3 to 4), 1026(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(996: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(991: 6), (992: 2), (996: 4), (997: 2), (998: 4), (1002: 3), (1022: 1), (1026: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
