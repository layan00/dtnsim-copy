The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1008(1 to 12), 1009(12 to 5), 1013(7 to 3), 1014(10 to 6), 1015(11 to 1), 1018(6 to 7), 1036(3 to 4), 1039(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1008: 4), (1009: 2), (1013: 2), (1014: 2), (1015: 4), (1018: 5), (1036: 1), (1039: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
