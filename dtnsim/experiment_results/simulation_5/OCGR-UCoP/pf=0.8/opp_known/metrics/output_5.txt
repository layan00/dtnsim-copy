The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(1 to 12), 195(12 to 5), 201(7 to 3), 202(10 to 6), 203(11 to 1), 206(6 to 7), 229(3 to 4), 233(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 15.000000), (229: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 4), (195: 6), (201: 2), (202: 2), (203: 3), (206: 8), (229: 2), (233: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
