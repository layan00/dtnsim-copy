The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
463(1 to 12), 464(12 to 5), 468(7 to 3), 469(10 to 6), 470(11 to 1), 472(6 to 7), 497(3 to 4), 500(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(463: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(463: 6), (464: 2), (468: 2), (469: 3), (470: 4), (472: 5), (497: 1), (500: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
