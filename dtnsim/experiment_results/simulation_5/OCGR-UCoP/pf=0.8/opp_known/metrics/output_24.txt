The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1275(1 to 12), 1276(12 to 5), 1279(7 to 3), 1280(10 to 6), 1281(11 to 1), 1283(6 to 7), 1298(3 to 4), 1301(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1275: 4), (1276: 2), (1279: 2), (1280: 2), (1281: 4), (1283: 1), (1298: 1), (1301: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
