The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
727(1 to 12), 728(12 to 5), 732(7 to 3), 733(10 to 6), 734(11 to 1), 735(6 to 7), 750(3 to 4), 754(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(727: 80.000000), (750: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(727: 4), (728: 2), (732: 2), (733: 2), (734: 4), (735: 1), (750: 2), (754: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
