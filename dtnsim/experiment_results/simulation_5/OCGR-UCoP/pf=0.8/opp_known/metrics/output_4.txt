The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1264(1 to 12), 1265(12 to 5), 1268(7 to 3), 1269(10 to 6), 1270(11 to 1), 1272(6 to 7), 1289(3 to 4), 1292(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1264: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1264: 4), (1265: 2), (1268: 2), (1269: 2), (1270: 4), (1272: 1), (1289: 1), (1292: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
