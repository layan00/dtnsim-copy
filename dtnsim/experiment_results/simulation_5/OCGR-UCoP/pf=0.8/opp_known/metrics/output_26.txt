The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
445(1 to 12), 446(12 to 5), 450(7 to 3), 451(10 to 6), 452(11 to 1), 455(6 to 7), 471(3 to 4), 475(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(445: 4), (446: 2), (450: 4), (451: 5), (452: 4), (455: 1), (471: 1), (475: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
