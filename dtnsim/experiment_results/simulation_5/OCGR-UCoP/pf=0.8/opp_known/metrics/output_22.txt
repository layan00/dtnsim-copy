The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
734(1 to 12), 735(12 to 5), 739(7 to 3), 740(10 to 6), 741(11 to 1), 743(6 to 7), 767(3 to 4), 771(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(741: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(734: 6), (735: 2), (739: 2), (740: 2), (741: 4), (743: 5), (767: 1), (771: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
