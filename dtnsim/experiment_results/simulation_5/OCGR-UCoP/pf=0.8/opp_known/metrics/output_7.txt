The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
742(1 to 12), 743(12 to 5), 747(7 to 3), 748(10 to 6), 749(11 to 1), 753(6 to 7), 769(3 to 4), 773(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(742: 4), (743: 2), (747: 4), (748: 2), (749: 4), (753: 1), (769: 1), (773: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
