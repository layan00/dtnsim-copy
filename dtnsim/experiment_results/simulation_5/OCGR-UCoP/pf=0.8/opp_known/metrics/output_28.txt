The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
994(1 to 12), 995(12 to 5), 1003(7 to 3), 1004(10 to 6), 1005(11 to 1), 1011(6 to 7), 1037(3 to 4), 1038(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(995: 30.000000), (1004: 15.000000), (1005: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(994: 6), (995: 4), (1003: 2), (1004: 4), (1005: 3), (1011: 1), (1037: 1), (1038: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
