The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1278(1 to 12), 1279(12 to 5), 1282(7 to 3), 1283(10 to 6), 1284(11 to 1), 1290(6 to 7), 1308(3 to 4), 1312(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1278: 4), (1279: 2), (1282: 4), (1283: 2), (1284: 4), (1290: 5), (1308: 1), (1312: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
