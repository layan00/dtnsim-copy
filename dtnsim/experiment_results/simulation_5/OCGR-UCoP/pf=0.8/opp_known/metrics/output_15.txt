The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 12), 199(12 to 5), 203(7 to 3), 204(10 to 6), 205(11 to 1), 207(6 to 7), 235(3 to 4), 236(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(198: 40.000000), (205: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 6), (199: 2), (203: 2), (204: 2), (205: 3), (207: 5), (235: 1), (236: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
