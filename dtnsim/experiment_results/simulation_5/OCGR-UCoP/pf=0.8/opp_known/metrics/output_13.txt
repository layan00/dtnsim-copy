The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1013(1 to 12), 1014(12 to 5), 1020(7 to 3), 1021(10 to 6), 1022(11 to 1), 1023(6 to 7), 1041(3 to 4), 1047(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1020: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1013: 4), (1014: 6), (1020: 4), (1021: 2), (1022: 4), (1023: 1), (1041: 2), (1047: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
