The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
739(1 to 12), 740(12 to 5), 743(7 to 3), 744(10 to 6), 745(11 to 1), 748(6 to 7), 762(3 to 4), 766(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(739: 4), (740: 2), (743: 3), (744: 2), (745: 4), (748: 1), (762: 2), (766: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
