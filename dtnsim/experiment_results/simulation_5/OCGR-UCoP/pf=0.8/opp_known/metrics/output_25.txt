The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(1 to 12), 190(12 to 5), 193(7 to 3), 194(10 to 6), 195(11 to 1), 197(6 to 7), 210(3 to 4), 213(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 4), (190: 2), (193: 2), (194: 2), (195: 4), (197: 1), (210: 1), (213: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
