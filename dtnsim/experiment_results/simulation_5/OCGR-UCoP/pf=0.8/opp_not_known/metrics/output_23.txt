The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1379(1 to 12), 1380(12 to 5), 1399(7 to 3), 1400(10 to 6), 1401(11 to 1), 1404(6 to 7), 1429(3 to 4), 1432(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1379: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1379: 3), (1380: 6), (1399: 1), (1400: 3), (1401: 4), (1404: 1), (1429: 1), (1432: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 114 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
