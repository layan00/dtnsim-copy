The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 12), 207(12 to 5), 225(7 to 3), 226(10 to 6), 227(11 to 1), 230(6 to 7), 264(3 to 4), 270(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 25.000000), (264: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 3), (207: 6), (225: 1), (226: 5), (227: 4), (230: 7), (264: 2), (270: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 92 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
