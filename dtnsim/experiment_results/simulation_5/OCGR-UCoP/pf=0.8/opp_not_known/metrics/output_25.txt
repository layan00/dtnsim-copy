The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 12), 202(12 to 5), 217(7 to 3), 218(10 to 6), 219(11 to 1), 221(6 to 7), 246(3 to 4), 249(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 3), (202: 1), (217: 1), (218: 3), (219: 4), (221: 1), (246: 1), (249: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 102 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
