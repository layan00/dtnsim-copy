The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
603(1 to 12), 604(12 to 5), 619(7 to 3), 620(10 to 6), 621(11 to 1), 623(6 to 7), 655(3 to 4), 660(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(655: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(603: 3), (604: 2), (619: 1), (620: 3), (621: 4), (623: 8), (655: 2), (660: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 136 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
