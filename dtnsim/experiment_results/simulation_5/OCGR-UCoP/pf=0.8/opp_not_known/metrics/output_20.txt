The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(1 to 12), 212(12 to 5), 227(7 to 3), 228(10 to 6), 229(11 to 1), 232(6 to 7), 266(3 to 4), 271(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(211: 3), (212: 1), (227: 1), (228: 3), (229: 4), (232: 6), (266: 2), (271: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 126 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
