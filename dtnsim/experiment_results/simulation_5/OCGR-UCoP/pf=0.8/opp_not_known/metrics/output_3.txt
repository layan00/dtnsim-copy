The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1371(1 to 12), 1372(12 to 5), 1387(7 to 3), 1388(10 to 6), 1389(11 to 1), 1390(6 to 7), 1419(3 to 4), 1424(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1371: 3), (1372: 2), (1387: 3), (1388: 3), (1389: 4), (1390: 1), (1419: 2), (1424: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
