The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1363(1 to 12), 1364(12 to 5), 1380(7 to 3), 1381(10 to 6), 1382(11 to 1), 1387(6 to 7), 1416(3 to 4), 1421(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1380: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1363: 3), (1364: 1), (1380: 3), (1381: 5), (1382: 4), (1387: 3), (1416: 1), (1421: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 133 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
