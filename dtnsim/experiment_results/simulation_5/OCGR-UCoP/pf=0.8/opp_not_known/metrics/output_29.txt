The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1772(1 to 12), 1773(12 to 5), 1788(7 to 3), 1789(10 to 6), 1790(11 to 1), 1795(6 to 7), 1826(3 to 4), 1829(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1772: 3), (1773: 2), (1788: 1), (1789: 4), (1790: 4), (1795: 5), (1826: 1), (1829: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 25 calls to RUCoP, which took 141 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
