The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1751(1 to 12), 1752(12 to 5), 1768(7 to 3), 1769(10 to 6), 1770(11 to 1), 1772(6 to 7), 1798(3 to 4), 1801(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1751: 3), (1752: 1), (1768: 1), (1769: 5), (1770: 4), (1772: 1), (1798: 1), (1801: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 139 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
