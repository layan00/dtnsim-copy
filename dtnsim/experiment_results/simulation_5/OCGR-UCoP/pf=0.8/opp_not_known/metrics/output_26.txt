The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
577(1 to 12), 578(12 to 5), 594(7 to 3), 595(10 to 6), 596(11 to 1), 599(6 to 7), 625(3 to 4), 630(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(577: 3), (578: 1), (594: 3), (595: 4), (596: 4), (599: 1), (625: 1), (630: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 96 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
