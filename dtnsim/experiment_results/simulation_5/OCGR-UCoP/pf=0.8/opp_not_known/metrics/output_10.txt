The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
204(1 to 12), 205(12 to 5), 223(7 to 3), 224(10 to 6), 225(11 to 1), 228(6 to 7), 255(3 to 4), 258(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(204: 3), (205: 6), (223: 1), (224: 5), (225: 4), (228: 1), (255: 1), (258: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 23 calls to RUCoP, which took 127 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
