The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
988(1 to 12), 989(12 to 5), 1008(7 to 3), 1009(10 to 6), 1010(11 to 1), 1011(6 to 7), 1039(3 to 4), 1044(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(988: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(988: 3), (989: 6), (1008: 1), (1009: 5), (1010: 4), (1011: 1), (1039: 2), (1044: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 114 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
