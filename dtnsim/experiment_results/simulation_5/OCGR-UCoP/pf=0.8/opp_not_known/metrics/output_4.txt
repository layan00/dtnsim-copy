The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1758(1 to 12), 1759(12 to 5), 1774(7 to 3), 1775(10 to 6), 1776(11 to 1), 1778(6 to 7), 1807(3 to 4), 1810(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1758: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1758: 3), (1759: 2), (1774: 1), (1775: 3), (1776: 4), (1778: 1), (1807: 1), (1810: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
