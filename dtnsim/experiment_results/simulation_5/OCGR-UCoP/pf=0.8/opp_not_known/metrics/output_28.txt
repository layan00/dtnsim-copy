The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1367(1 to 12), 1368(12 to 5), 1388(7 to 3), 1389(10 to 6), 1390(11 to 1), 1396(6 to 7), 1435(3 to 4), 1436(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1368: 30.000000), (1389: 15.000000), (1390: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1367: 3), (1368: 4), (1388: 1), (1389: 5), (1390: 7), (1396: 1), (1435: 1), (1436: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 104 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
