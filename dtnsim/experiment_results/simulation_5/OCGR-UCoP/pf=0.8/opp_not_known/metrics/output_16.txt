The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
601(1 to 12), 602(12 to 5), 617(7 to 3), 618(10 to 6), 619(11 to 1), 620(6 to 7), 647(3 to 4), 650(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(601: 3), (602: 1), (617: 1), (618: 4), (619: 4), (620: 1), (647: 1), (650: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 107 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
