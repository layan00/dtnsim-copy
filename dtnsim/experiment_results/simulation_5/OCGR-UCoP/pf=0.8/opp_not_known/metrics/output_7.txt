The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
994(1 to 12), 995(12 to 5), 1011(7 to 3), 1012(10 to 6), 1013(11 to 1), 1016(6 to 7), 1044(3 to 4), 1048(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(994: 3), (995: 1), (1011: 3), (1012: 3), (1013: 4), (1016: 1), (1044: 1), (1048: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
