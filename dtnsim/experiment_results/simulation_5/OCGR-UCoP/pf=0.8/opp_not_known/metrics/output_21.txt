The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
602(1 to 12), 603(12 to 5), 620(7 to 3), 621(10 to 6), 622(11 to 1), 625(6 to 7), 651(3 to 4), 654(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(602: 3), (603: 1), (620: 1), (621: 4), (622: 4), (625: 1), (651: 1), (654: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 113 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
