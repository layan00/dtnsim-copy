The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1767(1 to 12), 1768(12 to 5), 1783(7 to 3), 1784(10 to 6), 1785(11 to 1), 1787(6 to 7), 1814(3 to 4), 1817(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1767: 3), (1768: 1), (1783: 1), (1784: 3), (1785: 4), (1787: 1), (1814: 1), (1817: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 110 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
