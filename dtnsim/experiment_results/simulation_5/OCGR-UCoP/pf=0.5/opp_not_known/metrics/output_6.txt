The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
642(1 to 12), 643(12 to 5), 659(7 to 3), 660(10 to 6), 661(11 to 1), 669(6 to 7), 708(3 to 4), 709(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(642: 80.000000), (660: 15.000000), (709: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(642: 3), (643: 1), (659: 1), (660: 5), (661: 2), (669: 3), (708: 1), (709: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 78 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
