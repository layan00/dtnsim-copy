The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
630(1 to 12), 631(12 to 5), 648(7 to 3), 649(10 to 6), 650(11 to 1), 657(6 to 7), 687(3 to 4), 691(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(648: 45.000000), (649: 65.000000), (691: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(630: 3), (631: 1), (648: 3), (649: 3), (650: 5), (657: 1), (687: 1), (691: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
