The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1062(1 to 12), 1063(12 to 5), 1079(7 to 3), 1080(10 to 6), 1081(11 to 1), 1088(6 to 7), 1125(3 to 4), 1130(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1062: 80.000000), (1080: 15.000000), (1081: 25.000000), (1125: 10.000000), (1130: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1062: 3), (1063: 1), (1079: 1), (1080: 4), (1081: 5), (1088: 3), (1125: 2), (1130: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 56 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
