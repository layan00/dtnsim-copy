The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 12), 218(12 to 5), 236(7 to 3), 237(10 to 6), 238(11 to 1), 246(6 to 7), 286(3 to 4), 288(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 30.000000), (238: 15.000000), (286: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 3), (218: 4), (236: 1), (237: 3), (238: 8), (246: 3), (286: 2), (288: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
