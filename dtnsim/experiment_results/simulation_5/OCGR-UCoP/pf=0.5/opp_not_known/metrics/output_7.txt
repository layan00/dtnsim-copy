The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1059(1 to 12), 1060(12 to 5), 1077(7 to 3), 1078(10 to 6), 1079(11 to 1), 1087(6 to 7), 1120(3 to 4), 1125(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1059: 3), (1060: 1), (1077: 3), (1078: 7), (1079: 2), (1087: 3), (1120: 1), (1125: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 140 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
