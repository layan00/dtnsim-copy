The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1064(1 to 12), 1065(12 to 5), 1085(7 to 3), 1086(10 to 6), 1087(11 to 1), 1092(6 to 7), 1123(3 to 4), 1126(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1064: 80.000000), (1086: 65.000000), (1123: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1064: 3), (1065: 6), (1085: 1), (1086: 4), (1087: 2), (1092: 1), (1123: 2), (1126: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 86 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
