The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1883(1 to 12), 1884(12 to 5), 1901(7 to 3), 1902(10 to 6), 1903(11 to 1), 1915(6 to 7), 1950(3 to 4), 1951(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1883: 80.000000), (1884: 40.000000), (1903: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1883: 3), (1884: 3), (1901: 1), (1902: 5), (1903: 4), (1915: 1), (1950: 1), (1951: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 106 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
