The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1063(1 to 12), 1064(12 to 5), 1084(7 to 3), 1085(10 to 6), 1086(11 to 1), 1095(6 to 7), 1124(3 to 4), 1128(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1064: 30.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1063: 3), (1064: 4), (1084: 1), (1085: 6), (1086: 2), (1095: 3), (1124: 2), (1128: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 130 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
