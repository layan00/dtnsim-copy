The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 12), 221(12 to 5), 240(7 to 3), 241(10 to 6), 242(11 to 1), 244(6 to 7), 288(3 to 4), 292(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 80.000000), (242: 15.000000), (244: 55.000000), (288: 10.000000), (292: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 3), (221: 6), (240: 1), (241: 4), (242: 8), (244: 8), (288: 2), (292: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 64 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
