The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1886(1 to 12), 1887(12 to 5), 1904(7 to 3), 1905(10 to 6), 1906(11 to 1), 1914(6 to 7), 1948(3 to 4), 1951(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1906: 25.000000), (1951: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1886: 3), (1887: 1), (1904: 1), (1905: 4), (1906: 5), (1914: 3), (1948: 1), (1951: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 101 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
