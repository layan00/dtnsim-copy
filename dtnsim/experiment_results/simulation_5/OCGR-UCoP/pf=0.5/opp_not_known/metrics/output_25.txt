The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 12), 215(12 to 5), 233(7 to 3), 234(10 to 6), 235(11 to 1), 245(6 to 7), 279(3 to 4), 282(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 50.000000), (235: 5.000000), (282: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 3), (215: 4), (233: 1), (234: 4), (235: 4), (245: 5), (279: 1), (282: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 123 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
