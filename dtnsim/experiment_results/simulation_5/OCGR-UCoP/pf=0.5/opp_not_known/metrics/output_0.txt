The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 12), 225(12 to 5), 243(7 to 3), 244(10 to 6), 245(11 to 1), 254(6 to 7), 286(3 to 4), 292(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 80.000000), (245: 25.000000), (286: 10.000000), (292: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 3), (225: 2), (243: 4), (244: 4), (245: 5), (254: 1), (286: 2), (292: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 20 calls to RUCoP, which took 121 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
