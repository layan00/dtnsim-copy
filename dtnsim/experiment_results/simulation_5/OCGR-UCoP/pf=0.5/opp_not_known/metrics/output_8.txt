The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1471(1 to 12), 1472(12 to 5), 1493(7 to 3), 1494(10 to 6), 1495(11 to 1), 1500(6 to 7), 1534(3 to 4), 1537(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1471: 80.000000), (1472: 70.000000), (1495: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1471: 3), (1472: 7), (1493: 1), (1494: 4), (1495: 5), (1500: 3), (1534: 1), (1537: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
