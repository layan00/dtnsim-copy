The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(1 to 12), 228(12 to 5), 245(7 to 3), 246(10 to 6), 247(11 to 1), 253(6 to 7), 290(3 to 4), 294(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 80.000000), (247: 25.000000), (290: 10.000000), (294: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 3), (228: 1), (245: 1), (246: 4), (247: 5), (253: 3), (290: 2), (294: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 71 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
