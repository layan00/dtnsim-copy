The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1473(1 to 12), 1474(12 to 5), 1491(7 to 3), 1492(10 to 6), 1493(11 to 1), 1499(6 to 7), 1534(3 to 4), 1540(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1473: 80.000000), (1534: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1473: 3), (1474: 1), (1491: 3), (1492: 4), (1493: 5), (1499: 7), (1534: 2), (1540: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 103 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
