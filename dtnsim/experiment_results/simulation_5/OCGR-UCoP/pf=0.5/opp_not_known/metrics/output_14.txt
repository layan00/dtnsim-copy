The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1907(1 to 12), 1908(12 to 5), 1925(7 to 3), 1926(10 to 6), 1927(11 to 1), 1932(6 to 7), 1969(3 to 4), 1974(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1907: 80.000000), (1926: 65.000000), (1927: 25.000000), (1974: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1907: 3), (1908: 4), (1925: 1), (1926: 6), (1927: 5), (1932: 6), (1969: 2), (1974: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 89 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
