The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
646(1 to 12), 647(12 to 5), 663(7 to 3), 664(10 to 6), 665(11 to 1), 668(6 to 7), 703(3 to 4), 709(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(646: 80.000000), (647: 50.000000), (665: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(646: 3), (647: 4), (663: 1), (664: 2), (665: 5), (668: 5), (703: 1), (709: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 124 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
