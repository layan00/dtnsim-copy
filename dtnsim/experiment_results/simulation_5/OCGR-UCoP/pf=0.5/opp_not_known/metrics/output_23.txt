The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1484(1 to 12), 1485(12 to 5), 1502(7 to 3), 1503(10 to 6), 1504(11 to 1), 1508(6 to 7), 1537(3 to 4), 1538(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1484: 80.000000), (1503: 65.000000), (1538: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1484: 3), (1485: 1), (1502: 1), (1503: 4), (1504: 2), (1508: 1), (1537: 1), (1538: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 76 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
