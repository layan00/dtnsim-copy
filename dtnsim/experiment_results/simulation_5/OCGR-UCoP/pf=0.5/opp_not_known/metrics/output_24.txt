The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1898(1 to 12), 1899(12 to 5), 1915(7 to 3), 1916(10 to 6), 1917(11 to 1), 1925(6 to 7), 1960(3 to 4), 1963(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1898: 80.000000), (1916: 65.000000), (1917: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1898: 3), (1899: 1), (1915: 1), (1916: 4), (1917: 5), (1925: 5), (1960: 1), (1963: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 21 calls to RUCoP, which took 120 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
