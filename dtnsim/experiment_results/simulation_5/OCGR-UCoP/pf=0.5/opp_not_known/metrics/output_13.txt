The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1488(1 to 12), 1489(12 to 5), 1509(7 to 3), 1510(10 to 6), 1511(11 to 1), 1515(6 to 7), 1551(3 to 4), 1556(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1489: 30.000000), (1509: 25.000000), (1556: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1488: 3), (1489: 4), (1509: 3), (1510: 4), (1511: 2), (1515: 1), (1551: 2), (1556: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 14 calls to RUCoP, which took 88 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
