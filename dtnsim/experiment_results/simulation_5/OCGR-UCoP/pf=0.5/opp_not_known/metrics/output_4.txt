The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1896(1 to 12), 1897(12 to 5), 1917(7 to 3), 1918(10 to 6), 1919(11 to 1), 1924(6 to 7), 1959(3 to 4), 1961(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1896: 80.000000), (1917: 45.000000), (1961: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1896: 3), (1897: 6), (1917: 3), (1918: 4), (1919: 2), (1924: 5), (1959: 1), (1961: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 135 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
