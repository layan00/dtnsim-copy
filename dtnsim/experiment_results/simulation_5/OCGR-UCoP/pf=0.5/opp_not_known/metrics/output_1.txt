The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
645(1 to 12), 646(12 to 5), 666(7 to 3), 667(10 to 6), 668(11 to 1), 676(6 to 7), 709(3 to 4), 712(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(709: 10.000000), (712: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(645: 3), (646: 6), (666: 1), (667: 6), (668: 4), (676: 3), (709: 2), (712: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
