The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 12), 221(12 to 5), 241(7 to 3), 242(10 to 6), 243(11 to 1), 250(6 to 7), 280(3 to 4), 281(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 30.000000), (242: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 3), (221: 4), (241: 1), (242: 4), (243: 2), (250: 1), (280: 1), (281: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 111 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
