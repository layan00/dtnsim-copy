The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
645(1 to 12), 646(12 to 5), 663(7 to 3), 664(10 to 6), 665(11 to 1), 673(6 to 7), 709(3 to 4), 713(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(646: 50.000000), (664: 15.000000), (709: 10.000000), (713: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(645: 3), (646: 4), (663: 1), (664: 4), (665: 4), (673: 1), (709: 2), (713: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 13 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
