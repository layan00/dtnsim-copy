The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
291(1 to 12), 292(12 to 5), 298(7 to 3), 299(10 to 6), 300(11 to 1), 305(6 to 7), 315(3 to 4), 317(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(291: 2), (292: 3), (298: 2), (299: 5), (300: 2), (305: 3), (315: 2), (317: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
