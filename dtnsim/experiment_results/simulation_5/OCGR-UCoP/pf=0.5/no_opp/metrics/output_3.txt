The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
414(1 to 12), 415(12 to 5), 419(7 to 3), 420(10 to 6), 421(11 to 1), 427(6 to 7), 436(3 to 4), 441(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(436: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(414: 4), (415: 2), (419: 4), (420: 4), (421: 5), (427: 2), (436: 2), (441: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
