The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
541(1 to 12), 542(12 to 5), 546(7 to 3), 547(10 to 6), 548(11 to 1), 554(6 to 7), 564(3 to 4), 566(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(541: 3), (542: 5), (546: 3), (547: 3), (548: 4), (554: 2), (564: 2), (566: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
