The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
76(1 to 12), 77(12 to 5), 83(7 to 3), 84(10 to 6), 85(11 to 1), 92(6 to 7), 98(3 to 4), 99(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(84: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(76: 5), (77: 3), (83: 3), (84: 4), (85: 2), (92: 1), (98: 1), (99: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
