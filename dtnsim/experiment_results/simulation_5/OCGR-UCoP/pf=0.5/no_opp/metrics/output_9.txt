The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
521(1 to 12), 522(12 to 5), 525(7 to 3), 526(10 to 6), 527(11 to 1), 540(6 to 7), 552(3 to 4), 553(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(522: 40.000000), (527: 5.000000), (553: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(521: 2), (522: 4), (525: 3), (526: 5), (527: 4), (540: 1), (552: 1), (553: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
