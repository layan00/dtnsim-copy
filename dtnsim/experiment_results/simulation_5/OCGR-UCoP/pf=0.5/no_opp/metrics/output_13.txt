The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
426(1 to 12), 427(12 to 5), 434(7 to 3), 435(10 to 6), 436(11 to 1), 439(6 to 7), 451(3 to 4), 456(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(434: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(426: 4), (427: 2), (434: 4), (435: 4), (436: 2), (439: 1), (451: 2), (456: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
