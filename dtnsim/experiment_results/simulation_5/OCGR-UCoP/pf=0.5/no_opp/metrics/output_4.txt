The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
531(1 to 12), 532(12 to 5), 539(7 to 3), 540(10 to 6), 541(11 to 1), 546(6 to 7), 555(3 to 4), 558(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(532: 70.000000), (539: 45.000000), (558: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(531: 6), (532: 3), (539: 4), (540: 4), (541: 2), (546: 2), (555: 1), (558: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
