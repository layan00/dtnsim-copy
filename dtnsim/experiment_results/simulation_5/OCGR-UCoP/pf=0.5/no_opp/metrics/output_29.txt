The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
521(1 to 12), 522(12 to 5), 528(7 to 3), 529(10 to 6), 530(11 to 1), 541(6 to 7), 551(3 to 4), 555(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(521: 30.000000), (528: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(521: 5), (522: 2), (528: 4), (529: 4), (530: 5), (541: 3), (551: 1), (555: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
