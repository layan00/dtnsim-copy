The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
306(1 to 12), 307(12 to 5), 310(7 to 3), 311(10 to 6), 312(11 to 1), 321(6 to 7), 330(3 to 4), 333(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(310: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(306: 2), (307: 2), (310: 4), (311: 3), (312: 2), (321: 3), (330: 1), (333: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 306: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
