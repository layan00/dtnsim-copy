The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
197(1 to 12), 198(12 to 5), 202(7 to 3), 203(10 to 6), 204(11 to 1), 212(6 to 7), 221(3 to 4), 223(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 10.000000), (223: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(197: 4), (198: 2), (202: 2), (203: 6), (204: 4), (212: 3), (221: 2), (223: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
