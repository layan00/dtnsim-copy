The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
413(1 to 12), 414(12 to 5), 421(7 to 3), 422(10 to 6), 423(11 to 1), 428(6 to 7), 438(3 to 4), 440(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(414: 70.000000), (440: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(413: 4), (414: 3), (421: 2), (422: 4), (423: 5), (428: 3), (438: 1), (440: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
