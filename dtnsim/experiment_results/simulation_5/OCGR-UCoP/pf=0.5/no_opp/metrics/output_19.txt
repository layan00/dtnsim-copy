The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
532(1 to 12), 533(12 to 5), 537(7 to 3), 538(10 to 6), 539(11 to 1), 546(6 to 7), 555(3 to 4), 556(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(556: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(532: 2), (533: 2), (537: 2), (538: 5), (539: 2), (546: 3), (555: 1), (556: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
