The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
550(1 to 12), 551(12 to 5), 555(7 to 3), 556(10 to 6), 557(11 to 1), 566(6 to 7), 575(3 to 4), 576(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(550: 80.000000), (556: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(550: 5), (551: 2), (555: 3), (556: 4), (557: 4), (566: 2), (575: 1), (576: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
