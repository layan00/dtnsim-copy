The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
295(1 to 12), 296(12 to 5), 302(7 to 3), 303(10 to 6), 304(11 to 1), 310(6 to 7), 316(3 to 4), 321(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(296: 70.000000), (316: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(295: 2), (296: 3), (302: 4), (303: 4), (304: 5), (310: 1), (316: 2), (321: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
