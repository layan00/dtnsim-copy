The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
73(1 to 12), 74(12 to 5), 76(7 to 3), 77(10 to 6), 78(11 to 1), 86(6 to 7), 98(3 to 4), 101(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(76: 25.000000), (98: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(73: 2), (74: 2), (76: 3), (77: 3), (78: 4), (86: 3), (98: 2), (101: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
