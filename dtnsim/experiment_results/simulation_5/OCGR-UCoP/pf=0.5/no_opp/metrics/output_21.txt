The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 12), 204(12 to 5), 207(7 to 3), 208(10 to 6), 209(11 to 1), 218(6 to 7), 231(3 to 4), 233(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(208: 15.000000), (231: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 3), (204: 3), (207: 3), (208: 4), (209: 4), (218: 1), (231: 2), (233: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
