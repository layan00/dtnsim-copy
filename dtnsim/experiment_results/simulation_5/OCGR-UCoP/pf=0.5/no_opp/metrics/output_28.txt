The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
404(1 to 12), 405(12 to 5), 410(7 to 3), 411(10 to 6), 412(11 to 1), 421(6 to 7), 434(3 to 4), 436(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(411: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(404: 3), (405: 2), (410: 4), (411: 5), (412: 2), (421: 4), (434: 1), (436: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
