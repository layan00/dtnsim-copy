The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
316(1 to 12), 317(12 to 5), 319(7 to 3), 320(10 to 6), 321(11 to 1), 329(6 to 7), 343(3 to 4), 345(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(316: 80.000000), (320: 15.000000), (343: 10.000000), (345: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(316: 4), (317: 2), (319: 3), (320: 4), (321: 2), (329: 3), (343: 2), (345: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
