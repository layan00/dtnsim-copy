The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
190(1 to 12), 191(12 to 5), 194(7 to 3), 195(10 to 6), 196(11 to 1), 205(6 to 7), 221(3 to 4), 223(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(194: 25.000000), (195: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(190: 3), (191: 2), (194: 3), (195: 5), (196: 2), (205: 3), (221: 1), (223: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
