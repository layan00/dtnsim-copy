The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
411(1 to 12), 412(12 to 5), 418(7 to 3), 419(10 to 6), 420(11 to 1), 428(6 to 7), 437(3 to 4), 440(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(411: 80.000000), (412: 70.000000), (418: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(411: 5), (412: 3), (418: 4), (419: 5), (420: 2), (428: 4), (437: 1), (440: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
