The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
436(1 to 12), 437(12 to 5), 444(7 to 3), 445(10 to 6), 446(11 to 1), 450(6 to 7), 455(3 to 4), 456(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(445: 65.000000), (456: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(436: 4), (437: 2), (444: 2), (445: 4), (446: 2), (450: 1), (455: 1), (456: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
