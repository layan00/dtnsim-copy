The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
179(1 to 12), 180(12 to 5), 183(7 to 3), 184(10 to 6), 185(11 to 1), 193(6 to 7), 199(3 to 4), 201(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(184: 65.000000), (201: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(179: 4), (180: 2), (183: 4), (184: 4), (185: 2), (193: 1), (199: 1), (201: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 179: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
