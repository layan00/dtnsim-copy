The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
311(1 to 12), 312(12 to 5), 317(7 to 3), 318(10 to 6), 319(11 to 1), 328(6 to 7), 333(3 to 4), 335(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(311: 2), (312: 3), (317: 3), (318: 3), (319: 2), (328: 3), (333: 2), (335: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
