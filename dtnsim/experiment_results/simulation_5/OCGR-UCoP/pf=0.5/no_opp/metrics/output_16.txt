The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
190(1 to 12), 191(12 to 5), 195(7 to 3), 196(10 to 6), 197(11 to 1), 200(6 to 7), 208(3 to 4), 209(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(191: 70.000000), (209: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(190: 2), (191: 3), (195: 2), (196: 3), (197: 2), (200: 2), (208: 1), (209: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 190: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
