The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(1 to 12), 71(12 to 5), 76(7 to 3), 77(10 to 6), 78(11 to 1), 88(6 to 7), 96(3 to 4), 97(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(78: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 3), (71: 3), (76: 2), (77: 4), (78: 4), (88: 2), (96: 1), (97: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
