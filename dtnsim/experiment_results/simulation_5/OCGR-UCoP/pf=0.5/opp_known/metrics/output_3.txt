The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1106(1 to 12), 1107(12 to 5), 1112(7 to 3), 1113(10 to 6), 1114(11 to 1), 1117(6 to 7), 1143(3 to 4), 1147(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1106: 80.000000), (1114: 15.000000), (1143: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1106: 4), (1107: 2), (1112: 4), (1113: 3), (1114: 3), (1117: 8), (1143: 2), (1147: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
