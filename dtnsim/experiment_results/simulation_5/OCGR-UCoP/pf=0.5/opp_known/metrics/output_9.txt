The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1403(1 to 12), 1404(12 to 5), 1409(7 to 3), 1410(10 to 6), 1411(11 to 1), 1419(6 to 7), 1450(3 to 4), 1451(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1404: 40.000000), (1411: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1403: 6), (1404: 4), (1409: 3), (1410: 5), (1411: 3), (1419: 1), (1450: 1), (1451: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
