The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1112(1 to 12), 1113(12 to 5), 1122(7 to 3), 1123(10 to 6), 1124(11 to 1), 1128(6 to 7), 1152(3 to 4), 1153(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1112: 80.000000), (1113: 70.000000), (1124: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1112: 4), (1113: 7), (1122: 2), (1123: 2), (1124: 3), (1128: 3), (1152: 1), (1153: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
