The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 12), 216(12 to 5), 224(7 to 3), 225(10 to 6), 226(11 to 1), 232(6 to 7), 259(3 to 4), 261(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 80.000000), (216: 30.000000), (226: 15.000000), (259: 10.000000), (261: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 4), (216: 4), (224: 2), (225: 2), (226: 3), (232: 3), (259: 2), (261: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
