The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
516(1 to 12), 517(12 to 5), 522(7 to 3), 523(10 to 6), 524(11 to 1), 529(6 to 7), 555(3 to 4), 562(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 50.000000), (524: 25.000000), (555: 10.000000), (562: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(516: 6), (517: 5), (522: 3), (523: 2), (524: 4), (529: 1), (555: 2), (562: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
