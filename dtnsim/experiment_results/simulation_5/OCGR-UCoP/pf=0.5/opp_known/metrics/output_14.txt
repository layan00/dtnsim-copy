The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1436(1 to 12), 1437(12 to 5), 1442(7 to 3), 1443(10 to 6), 1444(11 to 1), 1450(6 to 7), 1476(3 to 4), 1479(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1436: 80.000000), (1444: 15.000000), (1479: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1436: 4), (1437: 5), (1442: 3), (1443: 2), (1444: 3), (1450: 7), (1476: 2), (1479: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
