The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1415(1 to 12), 1416(12 to 5), 1424(7 to 3), 1425(10 to 6), 1426(11 to 1), 1433(6 to 7), 1457(3 to 4), 1461(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1416: 30.000000), (1426: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1415: 6), (1416: 4), (1424: 2), (1425: 3), (1426: 4), (1433: 3), (1457: 1), (1461: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
