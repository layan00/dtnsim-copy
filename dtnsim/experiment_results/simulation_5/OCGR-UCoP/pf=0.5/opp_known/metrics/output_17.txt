The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
808(1 to 12), 809(12 to 5), 818(7 to 3), 819(10 to 6), 820(11 to 1), 824(6 to 7), 842(3 to 4), 847(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(808: 80.000000), (809: 30.000000), (842: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(808: 4), (809: 4), (818: 4), (819: 2), (820: 4), (824: 1), (842: 2), (847: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
