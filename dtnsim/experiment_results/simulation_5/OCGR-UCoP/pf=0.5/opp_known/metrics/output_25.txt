The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 12), 203(12 to 5), 209(7 to 3), 210(10 to 6), 211(11 to 1), 217(6 to 7), 241(3 to 4), 247(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 50.000000), (210: 45.000000), (247: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 4), (203: 5), (209: 2), (210: 6), (211: 4), (217: 5), (241: 1), (247: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
