The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
795(1 to 12), 796(12 to 5), 805(7 to 3), 806(10 to 6), 807(11 to 1), 811(6 to 7), 833(3 to 4), 839(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(795: 80.000000), (796: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(795: 4), (796: 6), (805: 2), (806: 2), (807: 4), (811: 3), (833: 2), (839: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
