The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
814(1 to 12), 815(12 to 5), 823(7 to 3), 824(10 to 6), 825(11 to 1), 834(6 to 7), 853(3 to 4), 857(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(815: 30.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(814: 4), (815: 4), (823: 3), (824: 5), (825: 4), (834: 3), (853: 2), (857: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
