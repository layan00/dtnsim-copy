The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
820(1 to 12), 821(12 to 5), 829(7 to 3), 830(10 to 6), 831(11 to 1), 836(6 to 7), 860(3 to 4), 866(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(820: 40.000000), (829: 25.000000), (830: 65.000000), (860: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(820: 6), (821: 6), (829: 3), (830: 3), (831: 4), (836: 1), (860: 2), (866: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
