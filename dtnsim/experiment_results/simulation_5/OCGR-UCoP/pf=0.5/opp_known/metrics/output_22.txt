The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
815(1 to 12), 816(12 to 5), 820(7 to 3), 821(10 to 6), 822(11 to 1), 828(6 to 7), 856(3 to 4), 861(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(815: 40.000000), (822: 25.000000), (856: 10.000000), (861: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(815: 6), (816: 2), (820: 3), (821: 2), (822: 4), (828: 3), (856: 2), (861: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
