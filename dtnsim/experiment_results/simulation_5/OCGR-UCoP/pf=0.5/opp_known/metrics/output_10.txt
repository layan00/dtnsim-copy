The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(1 to 12), 209(12 to 5), 217(7 to 3), 218(10 to 6), 219(11 to 1), 226(6 to 7), 247(3 to 4), 248(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 30.000000), (218: 65.000000), (219: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 4), (209: 4), (217: 3), (218: 3), (219: 3), (226: 1), (247: 1), (248: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
