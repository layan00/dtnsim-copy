The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1405(1 to 12), 1406(12 to 5), 1411(7 to 3), 1412(10 to 6), 1413(11 to 1), 1420(6 to 7), 1444(3 to 4), 1447(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1411: 25.000000), (1413: 15.000000), (1447: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1405: 4), (1406: 2), (1411: 4), (1412: 2), (1413: 3), (1420: 3), (1444: 1), (1447: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
