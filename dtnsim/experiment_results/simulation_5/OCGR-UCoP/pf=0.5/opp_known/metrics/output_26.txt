The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
500(1 to 12), 501(12 to 5), 506(7 to 3), 507(10 to 6), 508(11 to 1), 515(6 to 7), 535(3 to 4), 539(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(539: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(500: 4), (501: 2), (506: 4), (507: 5), (508: 4), (515: 1), (535: 1), (539: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
