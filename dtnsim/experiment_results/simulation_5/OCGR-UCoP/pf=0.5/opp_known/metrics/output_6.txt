The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
512(1 to 12), 513(12 to 5), 517(7 to 3), 518(10 to 6), 519(11 to 1), 527(6 to 7), 562(3 to 4), 564(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(512: 40.000000), (517: 25.000000), (518: 15.000000), (519: 15.000000), (564: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(512: 6), (513: 2), (517: 3), (518: 4), (519: 3), (527: 3), (562: 1), (564: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
