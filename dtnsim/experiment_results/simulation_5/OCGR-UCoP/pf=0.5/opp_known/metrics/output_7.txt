The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
817(1 to 12), 818(12 to 5), 823(7 to 3), 824(10 to 6), 825(11 to 1), 833(6 to 7), 856(3 to 4), 862(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(823: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(817: 4), (818: 2), (823: 4), (824: 6), (825: 4), (833: 3), (856: 1), (862: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
