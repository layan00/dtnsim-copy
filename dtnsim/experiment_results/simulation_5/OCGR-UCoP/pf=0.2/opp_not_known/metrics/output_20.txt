The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
236(1 to 12), 237(12 to 5), 258(7 to 3), 259(10 to 6), 260(11 to 1), 271(6 to 7), 321(3 to 4), 324(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 80.000000), (237: 30.000000), (259: 45.000000), (260: 15.000000), (271: 5.000000), (321: 10.000000), (324: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 3), (237: 4), (258: 1), (259: 6), (260: 8), (271: 5), (321: 2), (324: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 8 calls to RUCoP, which took 55 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
