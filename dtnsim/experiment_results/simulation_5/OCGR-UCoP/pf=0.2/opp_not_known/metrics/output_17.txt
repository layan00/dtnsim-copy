The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1131(1 to 12), 1132(12 to 5), 1153(7 to 3), 1154(10 to 6), 1155(11 to 1), 1168(6 to 7), 1205(3 to 4), 1208(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1131: 80.000000), (1132: 30.000000), (1154: 15.000000), (1155: 5.000000), (1205: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1131: 3), (1132: 4), (1153: 3), (1154: 4), (1155: 4), (1168: 1), (1205: 2), (1208: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 74 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
