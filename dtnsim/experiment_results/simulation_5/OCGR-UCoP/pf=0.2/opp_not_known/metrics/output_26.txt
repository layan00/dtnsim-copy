The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
688(1 to 12), 689(12 to 5), 710(7 to 3), 711(10 to 6), 712(11 to 1), 726(6 to 7), 764(3 to 4), 772(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(688: 80.000000), (689: 50.000000), (710: 25.000000), (711: 45.000000), (712: 5.000000), (772: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(688: 3), (689: 5), (710: 3), (711: 6), (712: 4), (726: 3), (764: 2), (772: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 75 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
