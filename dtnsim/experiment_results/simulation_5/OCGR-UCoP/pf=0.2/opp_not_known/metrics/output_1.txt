The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
697(1 to 12), 698(12 to 5), 720(7 to 3), 721(10 to 6), 722(11 to 1), 732(6 to 7), 773(3 to 4), 775(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(697: 80.000000), (698: 30.000000), (721: 65.000000), (722: 55.000000), (732: 5.000000), (773: 10.000000), (775: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(697: 3), (698: 4), (720: 1), (721: 6), (722: 8), (732: 5), (773: 2), (775: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 72 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
