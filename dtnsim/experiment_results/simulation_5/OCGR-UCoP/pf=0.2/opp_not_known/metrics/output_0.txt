The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(1 to 12), 238(12 to 5), 259(7 to 3), 260(10 to 6), 261(11 to 1), 273(6 to 7), 319(3 to 4), 325(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(237: 80.000000), (238: 30.000000), (259: 25.000000), (260: 15.000000), (261: 25.000000), (273: 5.000000), (319: 10.000000), (325: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 3), (238: 4), (259: 3), (260: 4), (261: 5), (273: 5), (319: 2), (325: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 70 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
