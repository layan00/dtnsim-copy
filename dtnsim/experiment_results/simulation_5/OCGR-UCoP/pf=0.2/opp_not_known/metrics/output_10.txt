The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
232(1 to 12), 233(12 to 5), 254(7 to 3), 255(10 to 6), 256(11 to 1), 267(6 to 7), 302(3 to 4), 305(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(233: 30.000000), (254: 45.000000), (302: 10.000000), (305: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(232: 3), (233: 4), (254: 3), (255: 5), (256: 4), (267: 1), (302: 2), (305: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 85 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
