The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
693(1 to 12), 694(12 to 5), 712(7 to 3), 713(10 to 6), 714(11 to 1), 727(6 to 7), 768(3 to 4), 771(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(694: 40.000000), (712: 45.000000), (713: 15.000000), (714: 5.000000), (768: 10.000000), (771: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(693: 3), (694: 3), (712: 3), (713: 4), (714: 4), (727: 1), (768: 2), (771: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 69 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
