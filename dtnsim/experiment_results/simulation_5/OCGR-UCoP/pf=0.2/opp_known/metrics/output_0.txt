The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(1 to 12), 226(12 to 5), 235(7 to 3), 236(10 to 6), 237(11 to 1), 248(6 to 7), 288(3 to 4), 293(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 40.000000), (226: 30.000000), (235: 55.000000), (236: 15.000000), (237: 25.000000), (248: 5.000000), (288: 10.000000), (293: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 6), (226: 4), (235: 6), (236: 4), (237: 4), (248: 5), (288: 2), (293: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 79 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
