The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
555(1 to 12), 556(12 to 5), 565(7 to 3), 566(10 to 6), 567(11 to 1), 575(6 to 7), 611(3 to 4), 612(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(556: 70.000000), (566: 15.000000), (567: 15.000000), (612: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(555: 6), (556: 7), (565: 4), (566: 4), (567: 3), (575: 5), (611: 1), (612: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
