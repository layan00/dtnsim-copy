The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 12), 225(12 to 5), 234(7 to 3), 235(10 to 6), 236(11 to 1), 247(6 to 7), 287(3 to 4), 291(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 40.000000), (225: 30.000000), (234: 25.000000), (235: 45.000000), (236: 15.000000), (247: 5.000000), (287: 10.000000), (291: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 6), (225: 4), (234: 4), (235: 6), (236: 3), (247: 5), (287: 2), (291: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
