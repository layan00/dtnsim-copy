The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 12), 221(12 to 5), 230(7 to 3), 231(10 to 6), 232(11 to 1), 239(6 to 7), 269(3 to 4), 271(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 40.000000), (221: 30.000000), (231: 65.000000), (232: 15.000000), (269: 10.000000), (271: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 6), (221: 4), (230: 4), (231: 3), (232: 3), (239: 1), (269: 2), (271: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
