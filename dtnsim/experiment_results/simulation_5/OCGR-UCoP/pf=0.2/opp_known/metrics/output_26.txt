The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
561(1 to 12), 562(12 to 5), 571(7 to 3), 572(10 to 6), 573(11 to 1), 584(6 to 7), 619(3 to 4), 623(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(561: 40.000000), (562: 30.000000), (571: 25.000000), (572: 45.000000), (573: 15.000000), (623: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(561: 6), (562: 4), (571: 4), (572: 6), (573: 3), (584: 3), (619: 2), (623: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
