The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
250(1 to 12), 251(12 to 5), 259(7 to 3), 260(10 to 6), 261(11 to 1), 270(6 to 7), 287(3 to 4), 289(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(250: 80.000000), (251: 70.000000), (260: 65.000000), (270: 5.000000), (287: 10.000000), (289: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(250: 5), (251: 3), (259: 2), (260: 6), (261: 4), (270: 5), (287: 2), (289: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
