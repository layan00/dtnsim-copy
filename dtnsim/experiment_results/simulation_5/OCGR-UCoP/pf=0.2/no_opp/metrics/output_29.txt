The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
696(1 to 12), 697(12 to 5), 705(7 to 3), 706(10 to 6), 707(11 to 1), 723(6 to 7), 746(3 to 4), 749(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(696: 30.000000), (697: 40.000000), (705: 25.000000), (706: 15.000000), (707: 5.000000), (746: 10.000000), (749: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(696: 5), (697: 4), (705: 3), (706: 4), (707: 4), (723: 4), (746: 2), (749: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
