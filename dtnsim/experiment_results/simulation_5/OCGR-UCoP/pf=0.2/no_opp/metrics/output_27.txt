The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
390(1 to 12), 391(12 to 5), 401(7 to 3), 402(10 to 6), 403(11 to 1), 413(6 to 7), 427(3 to 4), 436(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(390: 30.000000), (391: 70.000000), (401: 25.000000), (402: 45.000000), (403: 25.000000), (427: 10.000000), (436: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(390: 5), (391: 3), (401: 4), (402: 5), (403: 6), (413: 3), (427: 2), (436: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
