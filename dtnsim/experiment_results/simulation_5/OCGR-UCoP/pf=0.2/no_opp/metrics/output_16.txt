The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
237(1 to 12), 238(12 to 5), 246(7 to 3), 247(10 to 6), 248(11 to 1), 261(6 to 7), 275(3 to 4), 278(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(238: 70.000000), (246: 25.000000), (247: 15.000000), (248: 5.000000), (278: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(237: 6), (238: 3), (246: 3), (247: 4), (248: 4), (261: 2), (275: 1), (278: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
