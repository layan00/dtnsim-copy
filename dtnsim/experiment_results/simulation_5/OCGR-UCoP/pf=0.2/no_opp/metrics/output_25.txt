The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
87(1 to 12), 88(12 to 5), 94(7 to 3), 95(10 to 6), 96(11 to 1), 110(6 to 7), 127(3 to 4), 130(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(94: 25.000000), (95: 15.000000), (96: 5.000000), (130: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(87: 3), (88: 3), (94: 3), (95: 4), (96: 4), (110: 2), (127: 2), (130: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
