The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
674(1 to 12), 675(12 to 5), 685(7 to 3), 686(10 to 6), 687(11 to 1), 704(6 to 7), 720(3 to 4), 722(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 30.000000), (675: 70.000000), (686: 65.000000), (687: 5.000000), (704: 5.000000), (722: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(674: 5), (675: 3), (685: 3), (686: 4), (687: 4), (704: 5), (720: 2), (722: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
