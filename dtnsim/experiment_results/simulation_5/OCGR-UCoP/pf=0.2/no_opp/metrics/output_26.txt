The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
236(1 to 12), 237(12 to 5), 245(7 to 3), 246(10 to 6), 247(11 to 1), 264(6 to 7), 279(3 to 4), 283(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 30.000000), (245: 25.000000), (246: 45.000000), (247: 5.000000), (283: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 5), (237: 2), (245: 3), (246: 6), (247: 4), (264: 3), (279: 2), (283: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
