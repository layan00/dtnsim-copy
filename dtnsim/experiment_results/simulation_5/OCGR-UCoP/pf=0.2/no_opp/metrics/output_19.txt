The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
687(1 to 12), 688(12 to 5), 695(7 to 3), 696(10 to 6), 697(11 to 1), 712(6 to 7), 728(3 to 4), 731(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(687: 80.000000), (688: 70.000000), (695: 25.000000), (696: 15.000000), (697: 5.000000), (728: 10.000000), (731: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(687: 4), (688: 3), (695: 3), (696: 4), (697: 4), (712: 3), (728: 2), (731: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
