The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
248(1 to 12), 249(12 to 5), 253(7 to 3), 254(10 to 6), 255(11 to 1), 269(6 to 7), 287(3 to 4), 290(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(249: 40.000000), (253: 25.000000), (254: 15.000000), (255: 5.000000), (287: 10.000000), (290: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(248: 4), (249: 4), (253: 3), (254: 4), (255: 4), (269: 1), (287: 2), (290: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
