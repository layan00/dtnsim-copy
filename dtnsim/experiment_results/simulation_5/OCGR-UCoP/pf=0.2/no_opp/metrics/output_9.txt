The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
728(1 to 12), 729(12 to 5), 733(7 to 3), 734(10 to 6), 735(11 to 1), 750(6 to 7), 766(3 to 4), 769(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(728: 80.000000), (733: 25.000000), (734: 15.000000), (735: 5.000000), (766: 10.000000), (769: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(728: 4), (729: 2), (733: 3), (734: 4), (735: 4), (750: 4), (766: 2), (769: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
