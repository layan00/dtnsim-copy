The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
252(1 to 12), 253(12 to 5), 261(7 to 3), 262(10 to 6), 263(11 to 1), 278(6 to 7), 298(3 to 4), 301(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 70.000000), (261: 25.000000), (262: 15.000000), (263: 5.000000), (278: 5.000000), (298: 10.000000), (301: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(252: 4), (253: 3), (261: 3), (262: 4), (263: 4), (278: 5), (298: 2), (301: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
