The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(1 to 12), 229(12 to 5), 235(7 to 3), 236(10 to 6), 237(11 to 1), 245(6 to 7), 259(3 to 4), 261(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(259: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 2), (229: 3), (235: 3), (236: 3), (237: 2), (245: 2), (259: 2), (261: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
