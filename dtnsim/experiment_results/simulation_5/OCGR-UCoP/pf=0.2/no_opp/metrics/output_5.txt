The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
92(1 to 12), 93(12 to 5), 101(7 to 3), 102(10 to 6), 103(11 to 1), 119(6 to 7), 138(3 to 4), 142(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(92: 30.000000), (101: 25.000000), (102: 45.000000), (103: 5.000000), (119: 5.000000), (138: 10.000000), (142: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(92: 5), (93: 2), (101: 3), (102: 6), (103: 4), (119: 5), (138: 2), (142: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
