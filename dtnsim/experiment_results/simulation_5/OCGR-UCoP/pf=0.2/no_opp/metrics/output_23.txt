The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
545(1 to 12), 546(12 to 5), 553(7 to 3), 554(10 to 6), 555(11 to 1), 568(6 to 7), 585(3 to 4), 586(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(545: 30.000000), (554: 15.000000), (586: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(545: 5), (546: 2), (553: 3), (554: 5), (555: 2), (568: 3), (585: 1), (586: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
