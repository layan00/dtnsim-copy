The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
92(1 to 12), 93(12 to 5), 102(7 to 3), 103(10 to 6), 104(11 to 1), 117(6 to 7), 139(3 to 4), 144(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(92: 30.000000), (93: 70.000000), (102: 25.000000), (103: 45.000000), (104: 25.000000), (117: 5.000000), (139: 10.000000), (144: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(92: 5), (93: 3), (102: 3), (103: 6), (104: 4), (117: 5), (139: 2), (144: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
