The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
383(1 to 12), 384(12 to 5), 392(7 to 3), 393(10 to 6), 394(11 to 1), 407(6 to 7), 421(3 to 4), 425(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(384: 70.000000), (392: 25.000000), (393: 15.000000), (394: 5.000000), (421: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(383: 5), (384: 3), (392: 3), (393: 4), (394: 4), (407: 1), (421: 2), (425: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
