The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
554(1 to 12), 555(12 to 5), 560(7 to 3), 561(10 to 6), 562(11 to 1), 577(6 to 7), 598(3 to 4), 600(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(554: 80.000000), (561: 15.000000), (562: 5.000000), (577: 5.000000), (598: 10.000000), (600: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(554: 5), (555: 2), (560: 3), (561: 4), (562: 4), (577: 5), (598: 2), (600: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
