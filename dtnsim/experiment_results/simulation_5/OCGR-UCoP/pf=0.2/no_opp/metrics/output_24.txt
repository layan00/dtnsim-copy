The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
699(1 to 12), 700(12 to 5), 708(7 to 3), 709(10 to 6), 710(11 to 1), 725(6 to 7), 747(3 to 4), 750(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(699: 80.000000), (700: 70.000000), (708: 25.000000), (709: 15.000000), (710: 5.000000), (725: 5.000000), (750: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(699: 7), (700: 3), (708: 3), (709: 4), (710: 4), (725: 5), (747: 1), (750: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
