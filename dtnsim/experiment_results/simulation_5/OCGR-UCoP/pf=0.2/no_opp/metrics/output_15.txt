The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
88(1 to 12), 89(12 to 5), 95(7 to 3), 96(10 to 6), 97(11 to 1), 105(6 to 7), 127(3 to 4), 130(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(88: 80.000000), (89: 70.000000), (96: 15.000000), (105: 5.000000), (127: 10.000000), (130: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(88: 5), (89: 3), (95: 4), (96: 5), (97: 2), (105: 5), (127: 2), (130: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
