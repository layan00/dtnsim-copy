The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
402(1 to 12), 403(12 to 5), 413(7 to 3), 414(10 to 6), 415(11 to 1), 428(6 to 7), 448(3 to 4), 452(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(402: 30.000000), (403: 70.000000), (413: 25.000000), (414: 15.000000), (428: 5.000000), (448: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(402: 5), (403: 3), (413: 3), (414: 4), (415: 5), (428: 5), (448: 2), (452: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
