The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
545(1 to 12), 546(12 to 5), 551(7 to 3), 552(10 to 6), 553(11 to 1), 564(6 to 7), 585(3 to 4), 587(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(545: 80.000000), (552: 15.000000), (564: 5.000000), (585: 10.000000), (587: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(545: 5), (546: 2), (551: 3), (552: 5), (553: 2), (564: 5), (585: 2), (587: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
