The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
514(1 to 12), 515(12 to 5), 523(7 to 3), 524(10 to 6), 525(11 to 1), 539(6 to 7), 559(3 to 4), 565(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(514: 30.000000), (523: 25.000000), (524: 45.000000), (525: 5.000000), (539: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(514: 5), (515: 2), (523: 4), (524: 5), (525: 4), (539: 5), (559: 2), (565: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
