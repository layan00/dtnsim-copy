The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
359(1 to 12), 360(12 to 5), 367(7 to 3), 368(10 to 6), 369(11 to 1), 379(6 to 7), 393(3 to 4), 397(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(359: 80.000000), (360: 70.000000), (367: 25.000000), (368: 45.000000), (393: 10.000000), (397: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(359: 4), (360: 3), (367: 3), (368: 6), (369: 4), (379: 4), (393: 2), (397: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
