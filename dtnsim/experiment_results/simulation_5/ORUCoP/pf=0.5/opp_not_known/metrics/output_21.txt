The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
628(1 to 12), 629(12 to 5), 650(7 to 3), 651(10 to 6), 652(11 to 1), 666(6 to 7), 712(3 to 4), 717(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(651: 15.000000), (652: 25.000000), (712: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(628: 4), (629: 6), (650: 2), (651: 7), (652: 5), (712: 4), (717: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 222 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
