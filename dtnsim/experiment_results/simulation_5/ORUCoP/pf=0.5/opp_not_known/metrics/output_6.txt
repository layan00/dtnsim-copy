The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
622(1 to 12), 623(12 to 5), 641(7 to 3), 642(10 to 6), 643(11 to 1), 656(6 to 7), 704(3 to 4), 709(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(622: 80.000000), (641: 25.000000), (642: 15.000000), (643: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(622: 4), (641: 6), (642: 4), (643: 5), (656: 4), (704: 2), (709: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 169 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
