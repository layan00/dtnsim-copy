The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 12), 213(12 to 5), 235(7 to 3), 236(10 to 6), 237(11 to 1), 246(6 to 7), 289(3 to 4), 299(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 80.000000), (237: 25.000000), (289: 10.000000), (299: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 5), (213: 4), (236: 1), (237: 5), (246: 4), (289: 8), (299: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 137 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
