The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1867(1 to 12), 1868(12 to 5), 1891(7 to 3), 1892(10 to 6), 1893(11 to 1), 1901(6 to 7), 1945(3 to 4), 1950(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1867: 80.000000), (1868: 70.000000), (1891: 45.000000), (1893: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1867: 5), (1868: 6), (1891: 4), (1892: 2), (1893: 4), (1901: 6), (1950: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 245 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
