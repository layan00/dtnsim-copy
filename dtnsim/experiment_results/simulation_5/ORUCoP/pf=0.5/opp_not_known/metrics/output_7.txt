The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1034(1 to 12), 1035(12 to 5), 1056(7 to 3), 1057(10 to 6), 1058(11 to 1), 1070(6 to 7), 1111(3 to 4), 1118(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1056: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1034: 4), (1056: 4), (1057: 5), (1058: 5), (1070: 4), (1111: 2), (1118: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 226 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
