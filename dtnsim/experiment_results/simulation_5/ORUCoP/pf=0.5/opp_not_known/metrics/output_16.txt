The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
617(1 to 12), 618(12 to 5), 641(7 to 3), 642(10 to 6), 643(11 to 1), 649(6 to 7), 692(3 to 4), 695(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(617: 80.000000), (618: 70.000000), (643: 25.000000), (695: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(617: 6), (618: 8), (643: 4), (649: 6), (695: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 185 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
