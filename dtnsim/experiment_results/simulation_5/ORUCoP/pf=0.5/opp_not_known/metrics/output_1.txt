The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
624(1 to 12), 625(12 to 5), 648(7 to 3), 649(10 to 6), 650(11 to 1), 662(6 to 7), 704(3 to 4), 710(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(704: 10.000000), (710: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(624: 4), (625: 8), (649: 4), (650: 4), (662: 4), (704: 4), (710: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 175 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
