The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
596(1 to 12), 597(12 to 5), 618(7 to 3), 619(10 to 6), 620(11 to 1), 632(6 to 7), 668(3 to 4), 672(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(618: 45.000000), (619: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(596: 4), (618: 4), (619: 6), (620: 3), (672: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 247 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
