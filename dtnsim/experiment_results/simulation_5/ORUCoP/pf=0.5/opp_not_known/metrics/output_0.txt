The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
207(1 to 12), 208(12 to 5), 229(7 to 3), 230(10 to 6), 231(11 to 1), 244(6 to 7), 282(3 to 4), 291(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 80.000000), (229: 45.000000), (231: 25.000000), (282: 10.000000), (291: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(207: 5), (229: 8), (230: 2), (231: 5), (282: 4), (291: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 206 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
