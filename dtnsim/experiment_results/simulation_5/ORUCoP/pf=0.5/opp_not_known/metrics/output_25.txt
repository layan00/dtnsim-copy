The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
188(1 to 12), 189(12 to 5), 209(7 to 3), 210(10 to 6), 211(11 to 1), 225(6 to 7), 269(3 to 4), 271(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(211: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(188: 3), (189: 4), (210: 2), (211: 6), (225: 8), (271: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 202 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
