The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1039(1 to 12), 1040(12 to 5), 1064(7 to 3), 1065(10 to 6), 1066(11 to 1), 1078(6 to 7), 1114(3 to 4), 1118(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1065: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1039: 4), (1040: 4), (1064: 2), (1065: 5), (1066: 3), (1078: 4), (1114: 2), (1118: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
