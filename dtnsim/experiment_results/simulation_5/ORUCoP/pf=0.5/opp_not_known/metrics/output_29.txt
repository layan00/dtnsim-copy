The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1844(1 to 12), 1845(12 to 5), 1865(7 to 3), 1866(10 to 6), 1867(11 to 1), 1880(6 to 7), 1919(3 to 4), 1927(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1844: 4), (1865: 6), (1866: 2), (1867: 4), (1880: 4), (1927: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 76 calls to RUCoP, which took 317 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
