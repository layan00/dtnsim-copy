The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1883(1 to 12), 1884(12 to 5), 1904(7 to 3), 1905(10 to 6), 1906(11 to 1), 1920(6 to 7), 1966(3 to 4), 1970(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1883: 80.000000), (1905: 65.000000), (1906: 95.000000), (1970: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1883: 7), (1884: 6), (1904: 2), (1905: 6), (1906: 6), (1920: 6), (1970: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 72 calls to RUCoP, which took 305 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
