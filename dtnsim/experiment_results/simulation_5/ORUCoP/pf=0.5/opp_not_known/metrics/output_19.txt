The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1875(1 to 12), 1876(12 to 5), 1899(7 to 3), 1900(10 to 6), 1901(11 to 1), 1911(6 to 7), 1950(3 to 4), 1953(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1875: 80.000000), (1901: 25.000000), (1953: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1875: 6), (1876: 4), (1900: 3), (1901: 4), (1911: 4), (1950: 2), (1953: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 175 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
