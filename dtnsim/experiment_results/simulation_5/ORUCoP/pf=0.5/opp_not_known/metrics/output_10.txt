The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
199(1 to 12), 200(12 to 5), 222(7 to 3), 223(10 to 6), 224(11 to 1), 235(6 to 7), 270(3 to 4), 272(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 65.000000), (224: 95.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(199: 5), (200: 4), (222: 2), (223: 3), (224: 5), (272: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 62 calls to RUCoP, which took 265 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
