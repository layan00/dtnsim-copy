The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1903(1 to 12), 1904(12 to 5), 1923(7 to 3), 1924(10 to 6), 1925(11 to 1), 1935(6 to 7), 1980(3 to 4), 1986(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1903: 80.000000), (1924: 65.000000), (1925: 95.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1903: 4), (1904: 8), (1923: 4), (1924: 4), (1925: 6), (1935: 8), (1980: 2), (1986: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 225 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
