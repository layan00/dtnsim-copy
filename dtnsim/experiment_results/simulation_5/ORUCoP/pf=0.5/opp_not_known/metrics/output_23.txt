The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1468(1 to 12), 1469(12 to 5), 1491(7 to 3), 1492(10 to 6), 1493(11 to 1), 1500(6 to 7), 1538(3 to 4), 1541(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1468: 80.000000), (1492: 65.000000), (1541: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1468: 6), (1469: 7), (1492: 3), (1493: 5), (1541: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 62 calls to RUCoP, which took 240 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
