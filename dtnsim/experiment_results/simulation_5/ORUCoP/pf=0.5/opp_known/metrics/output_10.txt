The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
187(1 to 12), 188(12 to 5), 196(7 to 3), 197(10 to 6), 198(11 to 1), 209(6 to 7), 234(3 to 4), 236(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(197: 65.000000), (198: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(187: 5), (188: 2), (196: 2), (197: 3), (198: 5), (236: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
