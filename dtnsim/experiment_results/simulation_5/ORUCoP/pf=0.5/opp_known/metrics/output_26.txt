The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
465(1 to 12), 466(12 to 5), 473(7 to 3), 474(10 to 6), 475(11 to 1), 487(6 to 7), 513(3 to 4), 517(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(473: 45.000000), (474: 65.000000), (517: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(465: 4), (473: 4), (474: 6), (475: 3), (517: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
