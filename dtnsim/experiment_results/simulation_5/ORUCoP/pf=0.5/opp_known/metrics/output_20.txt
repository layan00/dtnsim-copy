The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(1 to 12), 201(12 to 5), 209(7 to 3), 210(10 to 6), 211(11 to 1), 220(6 to 7), 256(3 to 4), 263(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(200: 40.000000), (201: 50.000000), (211: 15.000000), (256: 10.000000), (263: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 7), (201: 5), (210: 1), (211: 4), (220: 2), (256: 4), (263: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
