The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1416(1 to 12), 1417(12 to 5), 1423(7 to 3), 1424(10 to 6), 1425(11 to 1), 1435(6 to 7), 1468(3 to 4), 1472(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1416: 80.000000), (1417: 40.000000), (1424: 65.000000), (1425: 15.000000), (1472: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1416: 4), (1417: 3), (1423: 2), (1424: 4), (1425: 5), (1435: 4), (1468: 1), (1472: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
