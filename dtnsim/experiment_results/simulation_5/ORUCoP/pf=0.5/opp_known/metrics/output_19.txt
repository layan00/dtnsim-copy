The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1371(1 to 12), 1372(12 to 5), 1380(7 to 3), 1381(10 to 6), 1382(11 to 1), 1392(6 to 7), 1427(3 to 4), 1430(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1382: 25.000000), (1430: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1371: 10), (1372: 3), (1381: 3), (1382: 6), (1392: 2), (1430: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
