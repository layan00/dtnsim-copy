The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1101(1 to 12), 1102(12 to 5), 1110(7 to 3), 1111(10 to 6), 1112(11 to 1), 1119(6 to 7), 1147(3 to 4), 1149(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1101: 80.000000), (1111: 65.000000), (1112: 15.000000), (1149: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1101: 7), (1102: 3), (1111: 3), (1112: 5), (1149: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
