The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
753(1 to 12), 754(12 to 5), 764(7 to 3), 765(10 to 6), 766(11 to 1), 774(6 to 7), 803(3 to 4), 808(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(753: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(753: 6), (754: 2), (765: 2), (766: 5), (774: 2), (803: 2), (808: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
