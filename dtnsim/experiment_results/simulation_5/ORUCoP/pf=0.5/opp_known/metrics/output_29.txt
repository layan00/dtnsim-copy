The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1353(1 to 12), 1354(12 to 5), 1361(7 to 3), 1362(10 to 6), 1363(11 to 1), 1376(6 to 7), 1407(3 to 4), 1413(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1363: 15.000000), (1413: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1353: 6), (1361: 6), (1362: 2), (1363: 5), (1376: 2), (1413: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
