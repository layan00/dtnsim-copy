The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1075(1 to 12), 1076(12 to 5), 1082(7 to 3), 1083(10 to 6), 1084(11 to 1), 1094(6 to 7), 1123(3 to 4), 1132(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1075: 80.000000), (1084: 15.000000), (1123: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1075: 5), (1082: 2), (1083: 5), (1084: 7), (1094: 5), (1123: 2), (1132: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
