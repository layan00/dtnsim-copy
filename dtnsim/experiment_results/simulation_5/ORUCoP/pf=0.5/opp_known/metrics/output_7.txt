The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
792(1 to 12), 793(12 to 5), 800(7 to 3), 801(10 to 6), 802(11 to 1), 815(6 to 7), 845(3 to 4), 852(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(800: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(792: 4), (800: 4), (801: 8), (802: 3), (815: 2), (852: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
