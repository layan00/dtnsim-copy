The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
176(1 to 12), 177(12 to 5), 184(7 to 3), 185(10 to 6), 186(11 to 1), 200(6 to 7), 231(3 to 4), 233(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(177: 40.000000), (233: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(176: 3), (177: 3), (185: 6), (186: 4), (200: 3), (233: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
