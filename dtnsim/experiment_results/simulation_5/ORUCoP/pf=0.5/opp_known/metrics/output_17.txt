The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
764(1 to 12), 765(12 to 5), 775(7 to 3), 776(10 to 6), 777(11 to 1), 787(6 to 7), 810(3 to 4), 818(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(764: 80.000000), (765: 70.000000), (810: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(764: 6), (765: 3), (775: 2), (776: 5), (777: 6), (810: 2), (818: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
