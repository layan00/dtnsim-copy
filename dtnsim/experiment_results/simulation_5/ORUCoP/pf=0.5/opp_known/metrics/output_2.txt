The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
794(1 to 12), 795(12 to 5), 804(7 to 3), 805(10 to 6), 806(11 to 1), 819(6 to 7), 845(3 to 4), 848(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(806: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(794: 4), (795: 2), (804: 1), (805: 6), (806: 6), (819: 2), (845: 1), (848: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
