The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
480(1 to 12), 481(12 to 5), 489(7 to 3), 490(10 to 6), 491(11 to 1), 497(6 to 7), 528(3 to 4), 531(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(480: 80.000000), (481: 40.000000), (491: 25.000000), (531: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(480: 6), (481: 5), (491: 4), (497: 3), (531: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
