The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
270(1 to 12), 271(12 to 5), 277(7 to 3), 278(10 to 6), 279(11 to 1), 288(6 to 7), 299(3 to 4), 303(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(277: 25.000000), (278: 65.000000), (299: 10.000000), (303: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(271: 1), (277: 3), (278: 3), (279: 2), (299: 2), (303: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
