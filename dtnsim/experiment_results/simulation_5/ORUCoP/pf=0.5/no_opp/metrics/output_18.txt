The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
356(1 to 12), 357(12 to 5), 365(7 to 3), 366(10 to 6), 367(11 to 1), 379(6 to 7), 390(3 to 4), 395(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(356: 80.000000), (357: 70.000000), (365: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(356: 4), (357: 4), (365: 4), (366: 4), (379: 3), (395: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
