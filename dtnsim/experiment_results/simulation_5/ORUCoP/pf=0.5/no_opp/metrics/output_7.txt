The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
269(1 to 12), 270(12 to 5), 275(7 to 3), 276(10 to 6), 277(11 to 1), 289(6 to 7), 300(3 to 4), 306(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(275: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(275: 4), (276: 1), (277: 3), (289: 2), (306: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
