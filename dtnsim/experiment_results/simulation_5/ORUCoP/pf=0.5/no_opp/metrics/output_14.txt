The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
500(1 to 12), 501(12 to 5), 507(7 to 3), 508(10 to 6), 509(11 to 1), 519(6 to 7), 533(3 to 4), 536(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(500: 80.000000), (508: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(500: 4), (501: 4), (507: 2), (508: 4), (509: 1), (519: 1), (533: 1), (536: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 500: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
