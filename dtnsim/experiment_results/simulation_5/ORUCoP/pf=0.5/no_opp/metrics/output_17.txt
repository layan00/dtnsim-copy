The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(1 to 12), 248(12 to 5), 256(7 to 3), 257(10 to 6), 258(11 to 1), 268(6 to 7), 275(3 to 4), 283(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 70.000000), (275: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(248: 3), (256: 2), (257: 5), (258: 3), (275: 2), (283: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
