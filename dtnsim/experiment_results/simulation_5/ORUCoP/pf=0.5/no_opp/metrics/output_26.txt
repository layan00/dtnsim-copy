The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
145(1 to 12), 146(12 to 5), 151(7 to 3), 152(10 to 6), 153(11 to 1), 165(6 to 7), 173(3 to 4), 177(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(151: 45.000000), (152: 65.000000), (177: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(145: 2), (151: 4), (152: 4), (153: 1), (177: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
