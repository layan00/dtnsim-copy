The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
53(1 to 12), 54(12 to 5), 61(7 to 3), 62(10 to 6), 63(11 to 1), 68(6 to 7), 88(3 to 4), 92(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(53: 80.000000), (54: 40.000000), (63: 25.000000), (88: 10.000000), (92: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(53: 5), (54: 5), (62: 2), (63: 5), (68: 1), (88: 2), (92: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
