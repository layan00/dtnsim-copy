The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
462(1 to 12), 463(12 to 5), 471(7 to 3), 472(10 to 6), 473(11 to 1), 488(6 to 7), 499(3 to 4), 506(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(462: 30.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(462: 6), (471: 6), (472: 2), (473: 2), (488: 2), (506: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
