The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
163(1 to 12), 164(12 to 5), 172(7 to 3), 173(10 to 6), 174(11 to 1), 182(6 to 7), 196(3 to 4), 199(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(196: 10.000000), (199: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(164: 3), (173: 2), (174: 2), (182: 1), (196: 2), (199: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 196: (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
