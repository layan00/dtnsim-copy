The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
398(1 to 12), 399(12 to 5), 408(7 to 3), 409(10 to 6), 410(11 to 1), 417(6 to 7), 426(3 to 4), 429(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(398: 80.000000), (409: 65.000000), (429: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(398: 6), (399: 1), (409: 3), (410: 4), (429: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 398: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
