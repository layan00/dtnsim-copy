The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
348(1 to 12), 349(12 to 5), 356(7 to 3), 357(10 to 6), 358(11 to 1), 370(6 to 7), 391(3 to 4), 396(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(349: 40.000000), (357: 15.000000), (370: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(348: 1), (349: 4), (356: 2), (357: 5), (358: 5), (370: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
