The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(1 to 12), 181(12 to 5), 186(7 to 3), 187(10 to 6), 188(11 to 1), 202(6 to 7), 221(3 to 4), 224(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(187: 15.000000), (221: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(180: 1), (181: 6), (186: 2), (187: 6), (188: 2), (221: 2), (224: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
