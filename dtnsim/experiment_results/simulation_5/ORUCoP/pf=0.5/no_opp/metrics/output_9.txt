The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
461(1 to 12), 462(12 to 5), 467(7 to 3), 468(10 to 6), 469(11 to 1), 488(6 to 7), 508(3 to 4), 510(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(462: 40.000000), (469: 5.000000), (510: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(462: 6), (467: 4), (468: 6), (469: 6), (510: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
