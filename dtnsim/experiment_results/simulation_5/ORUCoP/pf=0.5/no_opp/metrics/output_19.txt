The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
467(1 to 12), 468(12 to 5), 474(7 to 3), 475(10 to 6), 476(11 to 1), 486(6 to 7), 497(3 to 4), 499(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(499: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(468: 1), (475: 3), (476: 1), (486: 2), (499: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
