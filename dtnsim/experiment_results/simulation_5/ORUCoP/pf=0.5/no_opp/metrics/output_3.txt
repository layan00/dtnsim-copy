The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
366(1 to 12), 367(12 to 5), 373(7 to 3), 374(10 to 6), 375(11 to 1), 385(6 to 7), 396(3 to 4), 405(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(396: 10.000000), (405: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(366: 2), (373: 2), (374: 5), (375: 5), (385: 1), (396: 2), (405: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
