The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
160(1 to 12), 161(12 to 5), 166(7 to 3), 167(10 to 6), 168(11 to 1), 181(6 to 7), 202(3 to 4), 207(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(166: 25.000000), (167: 15.000000), (168: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(160: 2), (166: 6), (167: 4), (168: 5), (181: 2), (207: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
