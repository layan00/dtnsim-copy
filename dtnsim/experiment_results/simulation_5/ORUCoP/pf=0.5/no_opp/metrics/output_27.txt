The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(1 to 12), 248(12 to 5), 256(7 to 3), 257(10 to 6), 258(11 to 1), 266(6 to 7), 277(3 to 4), 281(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(248: 2), (257: 2), (266: 2), (277: 2), (281: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 277: (to: 5, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 277: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 266: (to: 9, time: 35.000000), 
Node 7:
