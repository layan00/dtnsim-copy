The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
50(1 to 12), 51(12 to 5), 55(7 to 3), 56(10 to 6), 57(11 to 1), 69(6 to 7), 84(3 to 4), 89(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(55: 25.000000), (84: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(51: 1), (55: 6), (56: 1), (57: 2), (69: 2), (84: 2), (89: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
