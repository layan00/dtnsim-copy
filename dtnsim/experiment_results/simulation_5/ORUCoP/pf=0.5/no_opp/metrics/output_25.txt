The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
44(1 to 12), 45(12 to 5), 52(7 to 3), 53(10 to 6), 54(11 to 1), 68(6 to 7), 80(3 to 4), 82(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(54: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(44: 2), (45: 4), (53: 2), (54: 4), (68: 1), (82: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 44: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
