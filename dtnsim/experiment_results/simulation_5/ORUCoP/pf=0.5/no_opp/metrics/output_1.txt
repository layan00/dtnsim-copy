The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
179(1 to 12), 180(12 to 5), 186(7 to 3), 187(10 to 6), 188(11 to 1), 200(6 to 7), 210(3 to 4), 213(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 10.000000), (213: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(179: 2), (180: 1), (187: 4), (188: 2), (200: 2), (210: 2), (213: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 179: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 210: (to: 4, time: 60.000000),

Node 4: 
Bundle 179: (to: 8, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 187: (to: 8, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 200: (to: 9, time: 35.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 187: (to: 4, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 213: (to: 4, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 213: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), (to: 7, time: 60.000000),
