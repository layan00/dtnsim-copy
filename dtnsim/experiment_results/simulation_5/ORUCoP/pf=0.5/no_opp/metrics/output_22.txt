The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
287(1 to 12), 288(12 to 5), 292(7 to 3), 293(10 to 6), 294(11 to 1), 305(6 to 7), 320(3 to 4), 325(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(287: 80.000000), (293: 15.000000), (320: 10.000000), (325: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(287: 3), (292: 2), (293: 4), (305: 2), (320: 4), (325: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
