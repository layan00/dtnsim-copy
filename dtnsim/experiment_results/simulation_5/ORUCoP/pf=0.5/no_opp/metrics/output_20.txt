The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
68(1 to 12), 69(12 to 5), 78(7 to 3), 79(10 to 6), 80(11 to 1), 91(6 to 7), 107(3 to 4), 114(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(68: 30.000000), (80: 25.000000), (107: 10.000000), (114: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(68: 7), (69: 1), (79: 1), (80: 5), (91: 2), (107: 4), (114: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
