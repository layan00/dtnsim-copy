The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
156(1 to 12), 157(12 to 5), 163(7 to 3), 164(10 to 6), 165(11 to 1), 171(6 to 7), 182(3 to 4), 184(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(157: 70.000000), (184: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(157: 4), (165: 1), (171: 1), (184: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
