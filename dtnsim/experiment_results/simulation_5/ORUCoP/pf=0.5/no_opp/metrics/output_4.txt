The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(1 to 12), 482(12 to 5), 491(7 to 3), 492(10 to 6), 493(11 to 1), 501(6 to 7), 511(3 to 4), 515(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(482: 70.000000), (491: 45.000000), (515: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 3), (482: 3), (491: 4), (492: 2), (493: 1), (501: 1), (515: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 481: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
