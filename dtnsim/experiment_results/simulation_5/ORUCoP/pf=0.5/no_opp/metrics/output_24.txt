The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
507(1 to 12), 508(12 to 5), 514(7 to 3), 515(10 to 6), 516(11 to 1), 530(6 to 7), 542(3 to 4), 544(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(507: 80.000000), (515: 65.000000), (544: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(507: 4), (508: 1), (514: 2), (515: 6), (516: 2), (530: 1), (544: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
