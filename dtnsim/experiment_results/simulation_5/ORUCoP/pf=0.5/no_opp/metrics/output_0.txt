The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
63(1 to 12), 64(12 to 5), 73(7 to 3), 74(10 to 6), 75(11 to 1), 88(6 to 7), 99(3 to 4), 107(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(63: 80.000000), (73: 45.000000), (99: 10.000000), (107: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(63: 6), (73: 8), (74: 2), (75: 2), (99: 4), (107: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
