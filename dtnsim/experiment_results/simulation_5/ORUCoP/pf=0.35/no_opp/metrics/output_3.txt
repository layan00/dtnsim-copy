The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
504(1 to 12), 505(12 to 5), 512(7 to 3), 513(10 to 6), 514(11 to 1), 529(6 to 7), 543(3 to 4), 551(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(514: 5.000000), (543: 10.000000), (551: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(504: 2), (505: 1), (512: 3), (513: 5), (514: 6), (529: 2), (543: 2), (551: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
