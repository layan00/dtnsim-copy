The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
563(1 to 12), 564(12 to 5), 571(7 to 3), 572(10 to 6), 573(11 to 1), 593(6 to 7), 609(3 to 4), 614(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(563: 80.000000), (571: 25.000000), (572: 15.000000), (573: 5.000000), (614: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(563: 3), (564: 1), (571: 6), (572: 6), (573: 4), (593: 2), (609: 1), (614: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
