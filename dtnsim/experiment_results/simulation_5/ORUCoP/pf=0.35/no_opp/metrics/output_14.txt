The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
601(1 to 12), 602(12 to 5), 611(7 to 3), 612(10 to 6), 613(11 to 1), 626(6 to 7), 639(3 to 4), 642(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(601: 80.000000), (612: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(601: 7), (602: 4), (611: 2), (612: 3), (613: 1), (626: 1), (639: 1), (642: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
