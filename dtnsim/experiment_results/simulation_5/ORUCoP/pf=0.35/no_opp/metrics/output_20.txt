The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
74(1 to 12), 75(12 to 5), 84(7 to 3), 85(10 to 6), 86(11 to 1), 97(6 to 7), 119(3 to 4), 127(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(74: 30.000000), (75: 50.000000), (86: 25.000000), (97: 25.000000), (119: 10.000000), (127: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(74: 7), (75: 4), (85: 1), (86: 5), (97: 5), (119: 4), (127: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
