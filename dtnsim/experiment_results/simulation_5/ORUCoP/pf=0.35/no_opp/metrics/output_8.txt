The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
492(1 to 12), 493(12 to 5), 505(7 to 3), 506(10 to 6), 507(11 to 1), 521(6 to 7), 541(3 to 4), 546(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(492: 30.000000), (493: 50.000000), (507: 25.000000), (546: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(492: 5), (493: 5), (506: 2), (507: 5), (521: 4), (546: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
