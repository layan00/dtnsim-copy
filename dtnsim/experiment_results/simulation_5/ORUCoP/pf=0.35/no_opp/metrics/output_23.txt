The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
478(1 to 12), 479(12 to 5), 488(7 to 3), 489(10 to 6), 490(11 to 1), 503(6 to 7), 520(3 to 4), 523(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(478: 30.000000), (489: 15.000000), (490: 25.000000), (523: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(478: 7), (479: 1), (489: 5), (490: 5), (503: 2), (523: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
