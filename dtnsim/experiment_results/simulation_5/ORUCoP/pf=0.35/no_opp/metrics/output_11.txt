The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
195(1 to 12), 196(12 to 5), 204(7 to 3), 205(10 to 6), 206(11 to 1), 215(6 to 7), 230(3 to 4), 236(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(204: 45.000000), (230: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 3), (204: 4), (205: 2), (206: 3), (215: 1), (230: 2), (236: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
