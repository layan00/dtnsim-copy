The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
247(1 to 12), 248(12 to 5), 258(7 to 3), 259(10 to 6), 260(11 to 1), 272(6 to 7), 287(3 to 4), 291(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 70.000000), (259: 65.000000), (291: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(247: 5), (248: 4), (259: 5), (260: 2), (272: 3), (287: 2), (291: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
