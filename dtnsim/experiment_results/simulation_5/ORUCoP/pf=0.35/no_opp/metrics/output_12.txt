The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
321(1 to 12), 322(12 to 5), 329(7 to 3), 330(10 to 6), 331(11 to 1), 346(6 to 7), 362(3 to 4), 368(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(321: 80.000000), (329: 25.000000), (330: 65.000000), (362: 10.000000), (368: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(321: 3), (322: 2), (329: 3), (330: 7), (331: 2), (346: 3), (362: 4), (368: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
