The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
467(1 to 12), 468(12 to 5), 477(7 to 3), 478(10 to 6), 479(11 to 1), 488(6 to 7), 512(3 to 4), 524(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(468: 40.000000), (477: 25.000000), (478: 15.000000), (479: 25.000000), (512: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(467: 5), (468: 4), (477: 5), (478: 5), (479: 6), (512: 4), (524: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
