The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
303(1 to 12), 304(12 to 5), 312(7 to 3), 313(10 to 6), 314(11 to 1), 329(6 to 7), 342(3 to 4), 348(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(304: 70.000000), (312: 25.000000), (313: 15.000000), (342: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(304: 3), (312: 4), (313: 6), (314: 3), (342: 2), (348: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
