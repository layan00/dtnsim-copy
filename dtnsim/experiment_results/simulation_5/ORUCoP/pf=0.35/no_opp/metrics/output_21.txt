The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(1 to 12), 210(12 to 5), 215(7 to 3), 216(10 to 6), 217(11 to 1), 235(6 to 7), 260(3 to 4), 264(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 40.000000), (216: 15.000000), (217: 25.000000), (260: 10.000000), (264: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 2), (210: 6), (215: 4), (216: 8), (217: 6), (260: 2), (264: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
