The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
616(1 to 12), 617(12 to 5), 623(7 to 3), 624(10 to 6), 625(11 to 1), 640(6 to 7), 660(3 to 4), 662(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(616: 80.000000), (624: 65.000000), (640: 25.000000), (662: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(616: 4), (617: 3), (623: 2), (624: 6), (625: 2), (640: 5), (662: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
