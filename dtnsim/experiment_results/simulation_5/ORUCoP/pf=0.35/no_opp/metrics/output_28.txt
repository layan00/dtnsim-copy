The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
464(1 to 12), 465(12 to 5), 472(7 to 3), 473(10 to 6), 474(11 to 1), 489(6 to 7), 515(3 to 4), 519(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(465: 40.000000), (473: 15.000000), (489: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(464: 2), (465: 4), (472: 5), (473: 5), (474: 5), (489: 5), (519: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
