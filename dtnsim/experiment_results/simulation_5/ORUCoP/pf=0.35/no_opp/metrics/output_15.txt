The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
61(1 to 12), 62(12 to 5), 69(7 to 3), 70(10 to 6), 71(11 to 1), 78(6 to 7), 100(3 to 4), 104(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(61: 80.000000), (62: 40.000000), (71: 25.000000), (100: 10.000000), (104: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(61: 5), (62: 5), (70: 4), (71: 5), (78: 1), (100: 2), (104: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
