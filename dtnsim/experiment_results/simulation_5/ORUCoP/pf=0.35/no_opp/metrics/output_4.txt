The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
640(1 to 12), 641(12 to 5), 651(7 to 3), 652(10 to 6), 653(11 to 1), 667(6 to 7), 680(3 to 4), 686(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(640: 80.000000), (641: 70.000000), (651: 45.000000), (653: 5.000000), (686: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(640: 5), (641: 4), (651: 4), (652: 7), (653: 4), (667: 1), (686: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
