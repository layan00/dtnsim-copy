The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
64(1 to 12), 65(12 to 5), 74(7 to 3), 75(10 to 6), 76(11 to 1), 87(6 to 7), 103(3 to 4), 110(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(74: 45.000000), (75: 65.000000), (76: 25.000000), (103: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(64: 2), (65: 2), (74: 6), (75: 7), (76: 6), (103: 2), (110: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
