The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
380(1 to 12), 381(12 to 5), 391(7 to 3), 392(10 to 6), 393(11 to 1), 409(6 to 7), 421(3 to 4), 426(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(381: 70.000000), (391: 45.000000), (392: 65.000000), (421: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(380: 2), (381: 4), (391: 3), (392: 6), (393: 3), (409: 3), (421: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
