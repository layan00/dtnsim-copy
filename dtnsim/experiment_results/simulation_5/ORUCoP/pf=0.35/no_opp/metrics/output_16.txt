The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
184(1 to 12), 185(12 to 5), 192(7 to 3), 193(10 to 6), 194(11 to 1), 204(6 to 7), 217(3 to 4), 222(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(185: 70.000000), (192: 45.000000), (193: 45.000000), (222: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(185: 4), (192: 4), (193: 5), (194: 1), (204: 1), (222: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
