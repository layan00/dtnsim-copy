The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
331(1 to 12), 332(12 to 5), 343(7 to 3), 344(10 to 6), 345(11 to 1), 355(6 to 7), 367(3 to 4), 377(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(331: 30.000000), (332: 70.000000), (343: 25.000000), (377: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(331: 6), (332: 3), (343: 5), (344: 3), (355: 2), (367: 2), (377: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
