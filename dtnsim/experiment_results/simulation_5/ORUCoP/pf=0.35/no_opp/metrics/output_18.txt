The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
430(1 to 12), 431(12 to 5), 439(7 to 3), 440(10 to 6), 441(11 to 1), 453(6 to 7), 466(3 to 4), 472(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(430: 80.000000), (431: 70.000000), (439: 45.000000), (440: 65.000000), (466: 10.000000), (472: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(430: 4), (431: 4), (439: 4), (440: 6), (453: 3), (466: 2), (472: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
