The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
597(1 to 12), 598(12 to 5), 606(7 to 3), 607(10 to 6), 608(11 to 1), 623(6 to 7), 644(3 to 4), 656(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(597: 30.000000), (598: 50.000000), (623: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(597: 6), (598: 6), (606: 7), (607: 2), (608: 6), (623: 5), (656: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
