The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
348(1 to 12), 349(12 to 5), 355(7 to 3), 356(10 to 6), 357(11 to 1), 373(6 to 7), 392(3 to 4), 402(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(355: 25.000000), (402: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(349: 10), (355: 4), (356: 8), (357: 3), (373: 3), (402: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
