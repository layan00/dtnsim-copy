The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 12), 204(12 to 5), 209(7 to 3), 210(10 to 6), 211(11 to 1), 227(6 to 7), 241(3 to 4), 244(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 45.000000), (244: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 2), (209: 6), (210: 4), (211: 1), (227: 2), (244: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 203: (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
