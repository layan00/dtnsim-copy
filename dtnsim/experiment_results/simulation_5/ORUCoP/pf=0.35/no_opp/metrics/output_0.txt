The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
82(1 to 12), 83(12 to 5), 94(7 to 3), 95(10 to 6), 96(11 to 1), 112(6 to 7), 144(3 to 4), 157(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 30.000000), (94: 25.000000), (95: 15.000000), (96: 25.000000), (112: 5.000000), (144: 10.000000), (157: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(82: 7), (83: 3), (94: 6), (95: 5), (96: 5), (112: 10), (144: 8), (157: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 83 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
