The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
67(1 to 12), 68(12 to 5), 72(7 to 3), 73(10 to 6), 74(11 to 1), 86(6 to 7), 103(3 to 4), 110(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(72: 25.000000), (73: 65.000000), (110: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(68: 1), (72: 6), (73: 5), (74: 2), (86: 2), (103: 2), (110: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
