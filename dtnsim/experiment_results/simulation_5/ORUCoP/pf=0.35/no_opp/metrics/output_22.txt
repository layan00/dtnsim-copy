The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
345(1 to 12), 346(12 to 5), 350(7 to 3), 351(10 to 6), 352(11 to 1), 366(6 to 7), 382(3 to 4), 387(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(345: 80.000000), (351: 15.000000), (382: 10.000000), (387: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(345: 3), (350: 2), (351: 5), (366: 2), (382: 4), (387: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
