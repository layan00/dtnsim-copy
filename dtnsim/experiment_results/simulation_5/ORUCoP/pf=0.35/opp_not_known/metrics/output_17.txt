The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1086(1 to 12), 1087(12 to 5), 1112(7 to 3), 1113(10 to 6), 1114(11 to 1), 1129(6 to 7), 1171(3 to 4), 1180(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1086: 80.000000), (1087: 70.000000), (1112: 25.000000), (1113: 15.000000), (1114: 25.000000), (1171: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1086: 6), (1087: 7), (1112: 4), (1113: 7), (1114: 6), (1171: 4), (1180: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 165 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
