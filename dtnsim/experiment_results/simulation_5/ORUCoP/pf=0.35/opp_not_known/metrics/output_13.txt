The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1566(1 to 12), 1567(12 to 5), 1589(7 to 3), 1590(10 to 6), 1591(11 to 1), 1600(6 to 7), 1650(3 to 4), 1669(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1567: 50.000000), (1589: 25.000000), (1590: 15.000000), (1591: 25.000000), (1650: 10.000000), (1669: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1566: 5), (1567: 10), (1589: 5), (1590: 5), (1591: 6), (1650: 8), (1669: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 171 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
