The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(1 to 12), 212(12 to 5), 233(7 to 3), 234(10 to 6), 235(11 to 1), 247(6 to 7), 298(3 to 4), 316(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(233: 25.000000), (234: 65.000000), (316: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(211: 10), (212: 4), (233: 6), (234: 5), (235: 13), (247: 4), (298: 4), (316: 5), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
