The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1980(1 to 12), 1981(12 to 5), 2005(7 to 3), 2006(10 to 6), 2007(11 to 1), 2027(6 to 7), 2073(3 to 4), 2079(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1980: 80.000000), (2005: 25.000000), (2006: 15.000000), (2007: 5.000000), (2079: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1980: 6), (1981: 4), (2005: 6), (2006: 8), (2007: 6), (2027: 4), (2073: 2), (2079: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 22 calls to RUCoP, which took 139 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
