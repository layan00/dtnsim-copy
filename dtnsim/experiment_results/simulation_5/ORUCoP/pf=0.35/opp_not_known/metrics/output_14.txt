The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2010(1 to 12), 2011(12 to 5), 2032(7 to 3), 2033(10 to 6), 2034(11 to 1), 2046(6 to 7), 2090(3 to 4), 2096(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2010: 80.000000), (2033: 65.000000), (2034: 95.000000), (2096: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2010: 5), (2011: 8), (2032: 4), (2033: 3), (2034: 6), (2046: 8), (2090: 2), (2096: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 233 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
