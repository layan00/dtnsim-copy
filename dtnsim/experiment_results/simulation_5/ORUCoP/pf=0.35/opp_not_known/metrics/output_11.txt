The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
646(1 to 12), 647(12 to 5), 672(7 to 3), 673(10 to 6), 674(11 to 1), 683(6 to 7), 732(3 to 4), 742(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(646: 80.000000), (672: 45.000000), (683: 55.000000), (732: 10.000000), (742: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(646: 6), (647: 6), (672: 4), (673: 4), (674: 5), (683: 12), (732: 4), (742: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 232 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
