The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1138(1 to 12), 1139(12 to 5), 1163(7 to 3), 1164(10 to 6), 1165(11 to 1), 1181(6 to 7), 1222(3 to 4), 1228(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1139: 70.000000), (1163: 45.000000), (1164: 65.000000), (1222: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1138: 4), (1139: 5), (1163: 3), (1164: 6), (1165: 5), (1181: 8), (1222: 4), (1228: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 76 calls to RUCoP, which took 290 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
