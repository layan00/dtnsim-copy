The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(1 to 12), 655(12 to 5), 676(7 to 3), 677(10 to 6), 678(11 to 1), 694(6 to 7), 738(3 to 4), 742(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(676: 45.000000), (677: 45.000000), (742: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 4), (676: 6), (677: 9), (678: 3), (694: 4), (742: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 213 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
