The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
678(1 to 12), 679(12 to 5), 702(7 to 3), 703(10 to 6), 704(11 to 1), 723(6 to 7), 771(3 to 4), 776(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(678: 80.000000), (679: 70.000000), (702: 25.000000), (703: 15.000000), (704: 25.000000), (776: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(678: 5), (679: 5), (702: 6), (703: 8), (704: 6), (723: 4), (776: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 171 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
