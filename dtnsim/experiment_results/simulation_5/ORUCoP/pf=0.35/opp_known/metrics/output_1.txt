The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
567(1 to 12), 568(12 to 5), 578(7 to 3), 579(10 to 6), 580(11 to 1), 592(6 to 7), 631(3 to 4), 637(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(567: 40.000000), (568: 40.000000), (579: 65.000000), (580: 55.000000), (637: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(567: 9), (568: 5), (579: 5), (580: 8), (592: 5), (631: 2), (637: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
