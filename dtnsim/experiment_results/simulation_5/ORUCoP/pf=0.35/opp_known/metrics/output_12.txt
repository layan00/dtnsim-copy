The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
849(1 to 12), 850(12 to 5), 859(7 to 3), 860(10 to 6), 861(11 to 1), 876(6 to 7), 922(3 to 4), 932(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(849: 40.000000), (850: 40.000000), (859: 25.000000), (860: 65.000000), (861: 15.000000), (876: 25.000000), (922: 10.000000), (932: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(849: 10), (850: 7), (859: 3), (860: 8), (861: 7), (876: 9), (922: 4), (932: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
