The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1214(1 to 12), 1215(12 to 5), 1222(7 to 3), 1223(10 to 6), 1224(11 to 1), 1239(6 to 7), 1273(3 to 4), 1281(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1214: 80.000000), (1224: 15.000000), (1273: 10.000000), (1281: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1214: 5), (1215: 4), (1222: 3), (1223: 8), (1224: 7), (1239: 2), (1273: 2), (1281: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
