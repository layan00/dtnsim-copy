The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(1 to 12), 528(12 to 5), 535(7 to 3), 536(10 to 6), 537(11 to 1), 553(6 to 7), 591(3 to 4), 594(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 40.000000), (535: 45.000000), (594: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 10), (535: 6), (536: 6), (537: 3), (553: 2), (594: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
