The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
515(1 to 12), 516(12 to 5), 526(7 to 3), 527(10 to 6), 528(11 to 1), 538(6 to 7), 584(3 to 4), 590(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(515: 40.000000), (516: 40.000000), (526: 45.000000), (527: 15.000000), (528: 55.000000), (538: 55.000000), (584: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(515: 12), (516: 5), (526: 4), (527: 6), (528: 6), (538: 7), (584: 2), (590: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
