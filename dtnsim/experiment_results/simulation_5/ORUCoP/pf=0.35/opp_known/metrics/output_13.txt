The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1200(1 to 12), 1201(12 to 5), 1209(7 to 3), 1210(10 to 6), 1211(11 to 1), 1221(6 to 7), 1269(3 to 4), 1280(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1200: 40.000000), (1201: 40.000000), (1209: 25.000000), (1210: 15.000000), (1211: 15.000000), (1269: 10.000000), (1280: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1200: 9), (1201: 7), (1209: 5), (1210: 8), (1211: 5), (1269: 4), (1280: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
