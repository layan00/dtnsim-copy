The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1195(1 to 12), 1196(12 to 5), 1207(7 to 3), 1208(10 to 6), 1209(11 to 1), 1221(6 to 7), 1261(3 to 4), 1263(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1195: 40.000000), (1196: 40.000000), (1209: 15.000000), (1263: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1195: 7), (1196: 5), (1208: 2), (1209: 5), (1221: 4), (1263: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
