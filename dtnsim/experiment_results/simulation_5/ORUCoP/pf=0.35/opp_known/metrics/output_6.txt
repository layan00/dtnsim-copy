The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
537(1 to 12), 538(12 to 5), 547(7 to 3), 548(10 to 6), 549(11 to 1), 568(6 to 7), 609(3 to 4), 611(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(537: 40.000000), (538: 70.000000), (547: 55.000000), (548: 15.000000), (549: 15.000000), (611: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(537: 8), (538: 3), (547: 9), (548: 6), (549: 7), (568: 2), (611: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
