The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
170(1 to 12), 171(12 to 5), 176(7 to 3), 177(10 to 6), 178(11 to 1), 184(6 to 7), 212(3 to 4), 219(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(170: 6), (178: 3), (184: 5), (212: 2), (219: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
