The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
648(1 to 12), 649(12 to 5), 655(7 to 3), 656(10 to 6), 657(11 to 1), 661(6 to 7), 683(3 to 4), 686(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(648: 80.000000), (683: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(648: 6), (657: 4), (683: 2), (686: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
