The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
419(1 to 12), 420(12 to 5), 425(7 to 3), 426(10 to 6), 427(11 to 1), 437(6 to 7), 460(3 to 4), 463(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(427: 25.000000), (463: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(419: 3), (425: 2), (427: 4), (437: 3), (463: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
