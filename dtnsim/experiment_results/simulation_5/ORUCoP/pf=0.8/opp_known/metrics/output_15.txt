The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
168(1 to 12), 169(12 to 5), 174(7 to 3), 175(10 to 6), 176(11 to 1), 181(6 to 7), 213(3 to 4), 215(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(168: 40.000000), (176: 15.000000), (215: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(168: 9), (176: 4), (181: 3), (215: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
