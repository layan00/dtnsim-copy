The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
168(1 to 12), 169(12 to 5), 176(7 to 3), 177(10 to 6), 178(11 to 1), 185(6 to 7), 208(3 to 4), 212(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(208: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(168: 4), (177: 3), (178: 4), (208: 3), (212: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 189 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
