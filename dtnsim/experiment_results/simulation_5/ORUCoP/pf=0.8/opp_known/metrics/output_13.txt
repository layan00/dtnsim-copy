The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
922(1 to 12), 923(12 to 5), 929(7 to 3), 930(10 to 6), 931(11 to 1), 935(6 to 7), 963(3 to 4), 971(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(929: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(922: 4), (923: 4), (929: 4), (930: 3), (931: 5), (963: 1), (971: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
