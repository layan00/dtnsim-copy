The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1175(1 to 12), 1176(12 to 5), 1182(7 to 3), 1183(10 to 6), 1184(11 to 1), 1188(6 to 7), 1216(3 to 4), 1218(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1176: 40.000000), (1183: 65.000000), (1218: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1175: 4), (1176: 5), (1183: 4), (1184: 4), (1218: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
