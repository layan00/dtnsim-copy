The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1168(1 to 12), 1169(12 to 5), 1174(7 to 3), 1175(10 to 6), 1176(11 to 1), 1186(6 to 7), 1214(3 to 4), 1218(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1218: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1168: 6), (1174: 4), (1175: 1), (1176: 4), (1186: 3), (1218: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
