The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
916(1 to 12), 917(12 to 5), 922(7 to 3), 923(10 to 6), 924(11 to 1), 931(6 to 7), 956(3 to 4), 958(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(916: 4), (923: 1), (924: 4), (931: 3), (958: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 916: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2:
