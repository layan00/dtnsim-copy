The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
897(1 to 12), 898(12 to 5), 906(7 to 3), 907(10 to 6), 908(11 to 1), 918(6 to 7), 958(3 to 4), 960(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(898: 40.000000), (907: 15.000000), (908: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(897: 10), (898: 6), (907: 8), (908: 4), (960: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
