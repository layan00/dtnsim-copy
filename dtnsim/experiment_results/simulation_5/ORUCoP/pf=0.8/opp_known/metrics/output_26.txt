The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
380(1 to 12), 381(12 to 5), 387(7 to 3), 388(10 to 6), 389(11 to 1), 396(6 to 7), 419(3 to 4), 424(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(380: 4), (387: 2), (388: 5), (389: 4), (424: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
