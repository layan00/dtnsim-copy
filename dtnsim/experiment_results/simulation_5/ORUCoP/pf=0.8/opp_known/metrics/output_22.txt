The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
665(1 to 12), 666(12 to 5), 672(7 to 3), 673(10 to 6), 674(11 to 1), 680(6 to 7), 714(3 to 4), 718(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 25.000000), (718: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(665: 10), (673: 2), (674: 6), (680: 3), (718: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
