The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1172(1 to 12), 1173(12 to 5), 1177(7 to 3), 1178(10 to 6), 1179(11 to 1), 1184(6 to 7), 1206(3 to 4), 1208(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1172: 5), (1179: 4), (1208: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1172: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000),
