The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
669(1 to 12), 670(12 to 5), 677(7 to 3), 678(10 to 6), 679(11 to 1), 683(6 to 7), 708(3 to 4), 712(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(669: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(669: 6), (670: 4), (678: 1), (679: 4), (708: 1), (712: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
