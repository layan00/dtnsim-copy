The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
407(1 to 12), 408(12 to 5), 414(7 to 3), 415(10 to 6), 416(11 to 1), 421(6 to 7), 458(3 to 4), 460(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(407: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(407: 12), (415: 2), (416: 4), (421: 3), (460: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
