The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
421(1 to 12), 422(12 to 5), 429(7 to 3), 430(10 to 6), 431(11 to 1), 440(6 to 7), 459(3 to 4), 461(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(421: 4), (430: 2), (431: 4), (461: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 421: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000), 
Node 2:

Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 461: (to: 13, time: 55.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10:
