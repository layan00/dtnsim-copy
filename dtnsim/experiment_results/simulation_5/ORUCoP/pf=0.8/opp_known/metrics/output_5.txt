The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
160(1 to 12), 161(12 to 5), 167(7 to 3), 168(10 to 6), 169(11 to 1), 175(6 to 7), 206(3 to 4), 211(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(169: 15.000000), (206: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(160: 4), (161: 4), (168: 1), (169: 5), (175: 5), (206: 2), (211: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
