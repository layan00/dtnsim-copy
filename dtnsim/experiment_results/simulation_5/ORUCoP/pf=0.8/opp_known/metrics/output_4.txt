The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1154(1 to 12), 1155(12 to 5), 1160(7 to 3), 1161(10 to 6), 1162(11 to 1), 1167(6 to 7), 1193(3 to 4), 1195(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1154: 40.000000), (1195: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1154: 7), (1162: 3), (1195: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
