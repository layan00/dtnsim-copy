The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
892(1 to 12), 893(12 to 5), 899(7 to 3), 900(10 to 6), 901(11 to 1), 909(6 to 7), 939(3 to 4), 944(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(899: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(892: 10), (899: 4), (900: 3), (901: 4), (909: 2), (944: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
