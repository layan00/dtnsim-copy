The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
636(1 to 12), 637(12 to 5), 645(7 to 3), 646(10 to 6), 647(11 to 1), 653(6 to 7), 680(3 to 4), 685(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 4), (637: 2), (646: 2), (647: 5), (680: 2), (685: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
