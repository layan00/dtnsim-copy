The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
156(1 to 12), 157(12 to 5), 163(7 to 3), 164(10 to 6), 165(11 to 1), 172(6 to 7), 196(3 to 4), 198(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(165: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(156: 4), (157: 3), (163: 1), (164: 1), (165: 5), (198: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
