The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
902(1 to 12), 903(12 to 5), 908(7 to 3), 909(10 to 6), 910(11 to 1), 914(6 to 7), 939(3 to 4), 946(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(902: 4), (908: 2), (909: 4), (910: 3), (939: 1), (946: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
