The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
924(1 to 12), 925(12 to 5), 932(7 to 3), 933(10 to 6), 934(11 to 1), 941(6 to 7), 961(3 to 4), 963(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(924: 80.000000), (963: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(924: 6), (925: 3), (934: 3), (963: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 924: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000),
