The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
667(1 to 12), 668(12 to 5), 674(7 to 3), 675(10 to 6), 676(11 to 1), 684(6 to 7), 706(3 to 4), 712(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(667: 6), (674: 3), (675: 2), (676: 3), (712: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
