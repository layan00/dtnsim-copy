The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
542(1 to 12), 543(12 to 5), 562(7 to 3), 563(10 to 6), 564(11 to 1), 568(6 to 7), 600(3 to 4), 603(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(542: 5), (564: 4), (603: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 187 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 542: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 542: (to: 5, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 603: (to: 13, time: 55.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Bundle 564: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 40.000000), 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Bundle 542: (to: 8, time: 0.000000), (to: 8, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 603: (to: 13, time: 55.000000),
