The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1299(1 to 12), 1300(12 to 5), 1318(7 to 3), 1319(10 to 6), 1320(11 to 1), 1327(6 to 7), 1366(3 to 4), 1368(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1299: 4), (1319: 1), (1320: 4), (1327: 6), (1368: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 205 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
