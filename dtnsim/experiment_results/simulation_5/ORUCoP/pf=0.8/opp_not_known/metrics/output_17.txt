The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
896(1 to 12), 897(12 to 5), 917(7 to 3), 918(10 to 6), 919(11 to 1), 923(6 to 7), 955(3 to 4), 959(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(896: 80.000000), (955: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(896: 6), (919: 4), (955: 3), (959: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 115 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
