The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
162(1 to 12), 163(12 to 5), 180(7 to 3), 181(10 to 6), 182(11 to 1), 187(6 to 7), 218(3 to 4), 220(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(162: 3), (182: 4), (218: 2), (220: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 161 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 162: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 218: (to: 9, time: 80.000000), (to: 9, time: 80.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 220: (to: 13, time: 55.000000), (to: 13, time: 120.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Bundle 182: (to: 14, time: 40.000000), (to: 14, time: 40.000000), 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Bundle 162: (to: 8, time: 40.000000),
