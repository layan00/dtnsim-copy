The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
557(1 to 12), 558(12 to 5), 579(7 to 3), 580(10 to 6), 581(11 to 1), 590(6 to 7), 619(3 to 4), 621(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(557: 4), (580: 2), (581: 4), (621: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 164 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
