The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
929(1 to 12), 930(12 to 5), 950(7 to 3), 951(10 to 6), 952(11 to 1), 960(6 to 7), 993(3 to 4), 1000(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(929: 5), (950: 4), (951: 2), (952: 5), (993: 2), (1000: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 56 calls to RUCoP, which took 207 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
