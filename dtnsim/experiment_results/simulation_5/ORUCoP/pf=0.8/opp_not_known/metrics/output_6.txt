The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
561(1 to 12), 562(12 to 5), 580(7 to 3), 581(10 to 6), 582(11 to 1), 592(6 to 7), 629(3 to 4), 632(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(582: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(561: 3), (580: 4), (582: 4), (592: 6), (632: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
