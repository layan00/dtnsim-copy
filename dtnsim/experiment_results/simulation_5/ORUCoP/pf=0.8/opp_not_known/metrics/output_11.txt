The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
543(1 to 12), 544(12 to 5), 564(7 to 3), 565(10 to 6), 566(11 to 1), 571(6 to 7), 615(3 to 4), 617(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(543: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(543: 7), (565: 2), (566: 4), (571: 6), (617: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 187 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
