The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1663(1 to 12), 1664(12 to 5), 1683(7 to 3), 1684(10 to 6), 1685(11 to 1), 1690(6 to 7), 1723(3 to 4), 1725(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1663: 80.000000), (1725: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1663: 6), (1684: 2), (1685: 4), (1725: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 130 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
