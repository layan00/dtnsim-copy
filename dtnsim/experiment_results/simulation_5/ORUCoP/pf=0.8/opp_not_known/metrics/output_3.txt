The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1275(1 to 12), 1276(12 to 5), 1295(7 to 3), 1296(10 to 6), 1297(11 to 1), 1301(6 to 7), 1337(3 to 4), 1346(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1275: 4), (1295: 2), (1296: 4), (1297: 5), (1337: 2), (1346: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 153 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
