The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1651(1 to 12), 1652(12 to 5), 1670(7 to 3), 1671(10 to 6), 1672(11 to 1), 1682(6 to 7), 1724(3 to 4), 1728(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1651: 6), (1670: 4), (1671: 1), (1672: 4), (1682: 6), (1728: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 70 calls to RUCoP, which took 265 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
