The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
168(1 to 12), 169(12 to 5), 190(7 to 3), 191(10 to 6), 192(11 to 1), 199(6 to 7), 232(3 to 4), 234(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(192: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(168: 4), (169: 6), (190: 2), (191: 2), (192: 5), (234: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 62 calls to RUCoP, which took 241 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
