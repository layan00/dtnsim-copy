The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
923(1 to 12), 924(12 to 5), 943(7 to 3), 944(10 to 6), 945(11 to 1), 951(6 to 7), 982(3 to 4), 986(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(923: 4), (943: 2), (945: 4), (982: 2), (986: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 168 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
