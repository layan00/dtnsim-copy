The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1260(1 to 12), 1261(12 to 5), 1281(7 to 3), 1282(10 to 6), 1283(11 to 1), 1291(6 to 7), 1328(3 to 4), 1333(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1281: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1260: 5), (1281: 4), (1282: 3), (1283: 4), (1291: 4), (1333: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 68 calls to RUCoP, which took 241 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
