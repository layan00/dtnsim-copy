The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1271(1 to 12), 1272(12 to 5), 1295(7 to 3), 1296(10 to 6), 1297(11 to 1), 1306(6 to 7), 1345(3 to 4), 1347(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1296: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1271: 6), (1272: 6), (1296: 4), (1297: 3), (1345: 2), (1347: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 188 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
