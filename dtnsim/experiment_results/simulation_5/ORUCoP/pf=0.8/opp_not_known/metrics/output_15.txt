The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(1 to 12), 181(12 to 5), 199(7 to 3), 200(10 to 6), 201(11 to 1), 206(6 to 7), 247(3 to 4), 250(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(180: 5), (201: 4), (206: 6), (250: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 203 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
