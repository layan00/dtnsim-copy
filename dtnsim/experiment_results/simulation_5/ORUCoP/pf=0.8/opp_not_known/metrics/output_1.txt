The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
552(1 to 12), 553(12 to 5), 572(7 to 3), 573(10 to 6), 574(11 to 1), 579(6 to 7), 618(3 to 4), 625(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(618: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(552: 5), (574: 3), (579: 11), (618: 3), (625: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
