The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1299(1 to 12), 1300(12 to 5), 1322(7 to 3), 1323(10 to 6), 1324(11 to 1), 1331(6 to 7), 1363(3 to 4), 1365(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1299: 80.000000), (1365: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1299: 6), (1300: 6), (1324: 3), (1365: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 156 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
