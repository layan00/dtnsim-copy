The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1678(1 to 12), 1679(12 to 5), 1699(7 to 3), 1700(10 to 6), 1701(11 to 1), 1705(6 to 7), 1740(3 to 4), 1742(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1679: 80.000000), (1700: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1678: 4), (1679: 5), (1700: 4), (1701: 4), (1742: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 186 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
