The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
884(1 to 12), 885(12 to 5), 908(7 to 3), 909(10 to 6), 910(11 to 1), 916(6 to 7), 955(3 to 4), 963(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(885: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(884: 4), (885: 7), (909: 2), (910: 4), (955: 6), (963: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 179 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
