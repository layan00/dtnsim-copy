The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1627(1 to 12), 1628(12 to 5), 1648(7 to 3), 1649(10 to 6), 1650(11 to 1), 1655(6 to 7), 1686(3 to 4), 1689(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1627: 5), (1649: 2), (1650: 4), (1686: 2), (1689: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 191 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
