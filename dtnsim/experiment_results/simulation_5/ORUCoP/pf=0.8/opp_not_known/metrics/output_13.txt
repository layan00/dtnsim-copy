The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1302(1 to 12), 1303(12 to 5), 1324(7 to 3), 1325(10 to 6), 1326(11 to 1), 1330(6 to 7), 1370(3 to 4), 1379(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1324: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1302: 4), (1303: 8), (1324: 4), (1325: 4), (1326: 4), (1370: 2), (1379: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 173 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
