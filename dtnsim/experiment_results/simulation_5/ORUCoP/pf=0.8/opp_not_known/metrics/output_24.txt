The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1669(1 to 12), 1670(12 to 5), 1687(7 to 3), 1688(10 to 6), 1689(11 to 1), 1694(6 to 7), 1727(3 to 4), 1729(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1669: 5), (1689: 4), (1729: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 171 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
