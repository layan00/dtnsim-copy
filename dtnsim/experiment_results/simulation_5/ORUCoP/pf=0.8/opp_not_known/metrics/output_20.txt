The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
182(1 to 12), 183(12 to 5), 202(7 to 3), 203(10 to 6), 204(11 to 1), 210(6 to 7), 251(3 to 4), 262(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(182: 5), (204: 3), (210: 10), (251: 4), (262: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 230 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
