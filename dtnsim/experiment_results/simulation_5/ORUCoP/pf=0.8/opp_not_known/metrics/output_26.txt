The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
510(1 to 12), 511(12 to 5), 531(7 to 3), 532(10 to 6), 533(11 to 1), 540(6 to 7), 573(3 to 4), 578(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(510: 4), (531: 2), (532: 5), (533: 4), (578: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 191 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
