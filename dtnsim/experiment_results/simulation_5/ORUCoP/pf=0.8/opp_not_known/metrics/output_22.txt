The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
920(1 to 12), 921(12 to 5), 941(7 to 3), 942(10 to 6), 943(11 to 1), 949(6 to 7), 992(3 to 4), 996(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(920: 80.000000), (943: 25.000000), (996: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(920: 7), (942: 2), (943: 6), (949: 6), (996: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 162 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
