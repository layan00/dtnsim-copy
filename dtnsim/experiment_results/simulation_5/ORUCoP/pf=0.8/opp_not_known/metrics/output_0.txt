The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(1 to 12), 181(12 to 5), 202(7 to 3), 203(10 to 6), 204(11 to 1), 211(6 to 7), 244(3 to 4), 248(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(244: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(180: 4), (203: 3), (204: 4), (244: 3), (248: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 44 calls to RUCoP, which took 179 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
