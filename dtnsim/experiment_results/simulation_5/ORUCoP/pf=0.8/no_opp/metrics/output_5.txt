The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
28(1 to 12), 29(12 to 5), 33(7 to 3), 34(10 to 6), 35(11 to 1), 41(6 to 7), 50(3 to 4), 53(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(50: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(29: 1), (34: 1), (35: 1), (41: 1), (50: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 50: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 50: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 41: (to: 9, time: 35.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 34: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), 
Node 11: 
Bundle 35: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 12: 
Bundle 29: (to: 9, time: 0.000000), 
Node 13: 
Node 14:
