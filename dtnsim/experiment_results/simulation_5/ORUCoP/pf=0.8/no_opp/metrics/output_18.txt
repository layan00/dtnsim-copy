The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
187(1 to 12), 188(12 to 5), 192(7 to 3), 193(10 to 6), 194(11 to 1), 202(6 to 7), 208(3 to 4), 213(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(192: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(192: 4), (193: 3), (202: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 192: (to: 3, time: 70.000000), (to: 3, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 193: (to: 3, time: 70.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 202: (to: 9, time: 35.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 192: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 193: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 202: (to: 12, time: 35.000000), 
Node 10:
