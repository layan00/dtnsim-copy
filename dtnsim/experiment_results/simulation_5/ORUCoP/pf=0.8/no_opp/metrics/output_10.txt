The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
24(1 to 12), 25(12 to 5), 29(7 to 3), 30(10 to 6), 31(11 to 1), 38(6 to 7), 42(3 to 4), 44(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(25: 1), (29: 1), (30: 2), (31: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 29: (to: 8, time: 30.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 30: (to: 8, time: 80.000000), (to: 8, time: 80.000000), 
Node 11:
