The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
197(1 to 12), 198(12 to 5), 201(7 to 3), 202(10 to 6), 203(11 to 1), 207(6 to 7), 217(3 to 4), 225(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 2), (202: 4), (203: 3), (217: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 217: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4:
