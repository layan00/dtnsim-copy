The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(1 to 12), 214(12 to 5), 219(7 to 3), 220(10 to 6), 221(11 to 1), 228(6 to 7), 230(3 to 4), 232(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(232: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 1), (221: 1), (232: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
