The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
266(1 to 12), 267(12 to 5), 272(7 to 3), 273(10 to 6), 274(11 to 1), 284(6 to 7), 290(3 to 4), 294(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(266: 3), (272: 4), (273: 1), (284: 1), (294: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 266: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 266: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 284: (to: 9, time: 35.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 272: (to: 8, time: 30.000000), (to: 8, time: 30.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 272: (to: 5, time: 50.000000), (to: 5, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 294: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10:
