The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
264(1 to 12), 265(12 to 5), 268(7 to 3), 269(10 to 6), 270(11 to 1), 275(6 to 7), 280(3 to 4), 282(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(282: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(269: 2), (282: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
