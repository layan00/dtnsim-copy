The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
135(1 to 12), 136(12 to 5), 140(7 to 3), 141(10 to 6), 142(11 to 1), 146(6 to 7), 150(3 to 4), 153(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(150: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(150: 2), (153: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 150: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 150: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 153: (to: 12, time: 80.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Node 14:
