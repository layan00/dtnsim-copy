The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
149(1 to 12), 150(12 to 5), 154(7 to 3), 155(10 to 6), 156(11 to 1), 164(6 to 7), 171(3 to 4), 177(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(154: 3), (155: 2), (156: 3), (177: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
