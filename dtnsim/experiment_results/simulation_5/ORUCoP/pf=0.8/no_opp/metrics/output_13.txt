The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(1 to 12), 209(12 to 5), 213(7 to 3), 214(10 to 6), 215(11 to 1), 219(6 to 7), 227(3 to 4), 233(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 1), (213: 4), (214: 3), (227: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 213: (to: 3, time: 70.000000), (to: 3, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 214: (to: 3, time: 70.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 227: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 213: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 214: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 214: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 209: (to: 9, time: 0.000000),
