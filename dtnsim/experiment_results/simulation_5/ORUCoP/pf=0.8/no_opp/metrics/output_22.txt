The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
154(1 to 12), 155(12 to 5), 159(7 to 3), 160(10 to 6), 161(11 to 1), 167(6 to 7), 175(3 to 4), 177(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(177: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(160: 2), (167: 1), (177: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5:
