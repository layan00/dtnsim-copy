The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(1 to 12), 85(12 to 5), 89(7 to 3), 90(10 to 6), 91(11 to 1), 96(6 to 7), 105(3 to 4), 107(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(90: 2), (96: 1), (107: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 96: (to: 9, time: 35.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 107: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), (to: 12, time: 80.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 90: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), (to: 8, time: 80.000000),
