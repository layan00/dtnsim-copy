The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
18(1 to 12), 19(12 to 5), 23(7 to 3), 24(10 to 6), 25(11 to 1), 30(6 to 7), 32(3 to 4), 34(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(18: 1), (34: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 18: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 34: (to: 7, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Node 13: 
Node 14: 
Node 15:
