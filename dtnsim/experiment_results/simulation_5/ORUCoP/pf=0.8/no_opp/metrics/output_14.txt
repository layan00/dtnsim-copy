The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
267(1 to 12), 268(12 to 5), 272(7 to 3), 273(10 to 6), 274(11 to 1), 278(6 to 7), 285(3 to 4), 287(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(273: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(267: 2), (268: 2), (273: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 267: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 267: (to: 8, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 273: (to: 8, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 273: (to: 4, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 273: (to: 6, time: 90.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 273: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 268: (to: 11, time: 40.000000), (to: 11, time: 40.000000),
