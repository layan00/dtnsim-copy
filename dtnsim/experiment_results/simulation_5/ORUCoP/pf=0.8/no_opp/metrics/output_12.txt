The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
147(1 to 12), 148(12 to 5), 153(7 to 3), 154(10 to 6), 155(11 to 1), 159(6 to 7), 164(3 to 4), 167(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(167: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(148: 1), (154: 2), (164: 1), (167: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 164: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 167: (to: 7, time: 60.000000), (to: 12, time: 80.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 154: (to: 8, time: 80.000000), (to: 8, time: 80.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 148: (to: 9, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 167: (to: 4, time: 100.000000),
