The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
60(1 to 12), 61(12 to 5), 65(7 to 3), 66(10 to 6), 67(11 to 1), 74(6 to 7), 77(3 to 4), 82(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(65: 2), (66: 3), (82: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
