The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
36(1 to 12), 37(12 to 5), 42(7 to 3), 43(10 to 6), 44(11 to 1), 49(6 to 7), 60(3 to 4), 63(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(44: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(36: 4), (44: 4), (49: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 36: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 36: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 36: (to: 8, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 44: (to: 1, time: 50.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 49: (to: 9, time: 35.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 44: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Bundle 44: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), (to: 10, time: 40.000000),
