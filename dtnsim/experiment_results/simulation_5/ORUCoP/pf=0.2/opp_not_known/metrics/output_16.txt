The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
686(1 to 12), 687(12 to 5), 709(7 to 3), 710(10 to 6), 711(11 to 1), 733(6 to 7), 786(3 to 4), 790(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(686: 80.000000), (687: 40.000000), (709: 25.000000), (710: 15.000000), (711: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(686: 5), (687: 7), (709: 6), (710: 7), (711: 8), (733: 6), (790: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 64 calls to RUCoP, which took 268 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
