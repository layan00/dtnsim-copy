The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
715(1 to 12), 716(12 to 5), 738(7 to 3), 739(10 to 6), 740(11 to 1), 764(6 to 7), 821(3 to 4), 827(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(715: 80.000000), (716: 40.000000), (738: 25.000000), (739: 15.000000), (740: 5.000000), (764: 5.000000), (821: 10.000000), (827: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(715: 5), (716: 5), (738: 6), (739: 7), (740: 8), (764: 10), (821: 3), (827: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 163 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
