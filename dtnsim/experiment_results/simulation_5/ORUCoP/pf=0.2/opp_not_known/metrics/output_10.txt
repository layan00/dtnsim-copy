The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 12), 221(12 to 5), 243(7 to 3), 244(10 to 6), 245(11 to 1), 265(6 to 7), 309(3 to 4), 316(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 40.000000), (243: 45.000000), (244: 45.000000), (245: 25.000000), (309: 10.000000), (316: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 4), (221: 5), (243: 6), (244: 9), (245: 8), (309: 3), (316: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 229 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
