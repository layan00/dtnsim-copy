The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1198(1 to 12), 1199(12 to 5), 1223(7 to 3), 1224(10 to 6), 1225(11 to 1), 1244(6 to 7), 1305(3 to 4), 1318(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1198: 80.000000), (1199: 40.000000), (1223: 25.000000), (1224: 15.000000), (1225: 25.000000), (1244: 5.000000), (1305: 10.000000), (1318: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1198: 7), (1199: 7), (1223: 4), (1224: 7), (1225: 8), (1244: 10), (1305: 8), (1318: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 170 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
