The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
707(1 to 12), 708(12 to 5), 730(7 to 3), 731(10 to 6), 732(11 to 1), 755(6 to 7), 806(3 to 4), 812(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(708: 40.000000), (730: 25.000000), (731: 15.000000), (732: 5.000000), (806: 10.000000), (812: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(707: 6), (708: 6), (730: 6), (731: 7), (732: 8), (806: 3), (812: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 162 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
