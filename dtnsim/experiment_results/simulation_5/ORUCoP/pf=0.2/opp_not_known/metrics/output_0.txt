The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
232(1 to 12), 233(12 to 5), 255(7 to 3), 256(10 to 6), 257(11 to 1), 273(6 to 7), 334(3 to 4), 346(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(232: 80.000000), (233: 80.000000), (255: 25.000000), (256: 15.000000), (257: 25.000000), (273: 5.000000), (334: 10.000000), (346: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(232: 6), (233: 5), (255: 6), (256: 7), (257: 6), (273: 10), (334: 10), (346: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 213 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
