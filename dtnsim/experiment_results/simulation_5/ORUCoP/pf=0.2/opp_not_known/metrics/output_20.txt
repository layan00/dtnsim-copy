The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
230(1 to 12), 231(12 to 5), 253(7 to 3), 254(10 to 6), 255(11 to 1), 271(6 to 7), 332(3 to 4), 345(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(230: 80.000000), (231: 40.000000), (253: 25.000000), (254: 45.000000), (255: 25.000000), (271: 5.000000), (332: 10.000000), (345: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(230: 5), (231: 5), (253: 6), (254: 11), (255: 5), (271: 10), (332: 8), (345: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 203 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
