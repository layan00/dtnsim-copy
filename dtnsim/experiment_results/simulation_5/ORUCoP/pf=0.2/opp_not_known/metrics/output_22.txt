The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1173(1 to 12), 1174(12 to 5), 1194(7 to 3), 1195(10 to 6), 1196(11 to 1), 1212(6 to 7), 1263(3 to 4), 1276(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1173: 80.000000), (1194: 25.000000), (1195: 15.000000), (1196: 25.000000), (1263: 10.000000), (1276: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1173: 6), (1194: 6), (1195: 7), (1196: 7), (1212: 4), (1263: 10), (1276: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
