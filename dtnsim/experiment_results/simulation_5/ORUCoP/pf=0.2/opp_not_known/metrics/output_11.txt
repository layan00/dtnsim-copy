The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
674(1 to 12), 675(12 to 5), 698(7 to 3), 699(10 to 6), 700(11 to 1), 712(6 to 7), 762(3 to 4), 776(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 80.000000), (675: 80.000000), (776: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(674: 7), (675: 5), (698: 5), (699: 4), (700: 6), (712: 12), (762: 6), (776: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 76 calls to RUCoP, which took 286 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
