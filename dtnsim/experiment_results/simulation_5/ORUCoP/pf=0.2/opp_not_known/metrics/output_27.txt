The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1176(1 to 12), 1177(12 to 5), 1200(7 to 3), 1201(10 to 6), 1202(11 to 1), 1216(6 to 7), 1258(3 to 4), 1280(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1176: 80.000000), (1200: 25.000000), (1201: 45.000000), (1202: 25.000000), (1258: 10.000000), (1280: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1176: 6), (1177: 2), (1200: 5), (1201: 10), (1202: 7), (1216: 4), (1258: 10), (1280: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 188 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
