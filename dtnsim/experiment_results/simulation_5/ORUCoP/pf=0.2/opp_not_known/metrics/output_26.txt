The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
704(1 to 12), 705(12 to 5), 727(7 to 3), 728(10 to 6), 729(11 to 1), 753(6 to 7), 799(3 to 4), 809(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(704: 80.000000), (727: 25.000000), (728: 45.000000), (729: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(704: 5), (705: 2), (727: 6), (728: 11), (729: 8), (753: 4), (799: 4), (809: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 253 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
