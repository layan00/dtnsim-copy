The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
595(1 to 12), 596(12 to 5), 605(7 to 3), 606(10 to 6), 607(11 to 1), 620(6 to 7), 663(3 to 4), 675(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(595: 40.000000), (596: 40.000000), (606: 65.000000), (607: 25.000000), (620: 25.000000), (663: 10.000000), (675: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(595: 9), (596: 7), (606: 7), (607: 8), (620: 9), (663: 4), (675: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
