The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
216(1 to 12), 217(12 to 5), 226(7 to 3), 227(10 to 6), 228(11 to 1), 248(6 to 7), 299(3 to 4), 310(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(217: 40.000000), (226: 25.000000), (227: 45.000000), (228: 15.000000), (248: 25.000000), (310: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 9), (217: 7), (226: 6), (227: 13), (228: 7), (248: 5), (299: 4), (310: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
