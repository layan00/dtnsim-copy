The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
585(1 to 12), 586(12 to 5), 595(7 to 3), 596(10 to 6), 597(11 to 1), 618(6 to 7), 671(3 to 4), 675(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(585: 40.000000), (586: 40.000000), (595: 55.000000), (596: 15.000000), (597: 15.000000), (618: 25.000000), (671: 10.000000), (675: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(585: 8), (586: 7), (595: 9), (596: 10), (597: 7), (618: 5), (671: 2), (675: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
