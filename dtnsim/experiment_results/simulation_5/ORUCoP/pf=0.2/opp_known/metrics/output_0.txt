The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 12), 221(12 to 5), 230(7 to 3), 231(10 to 6), 232(11 to 1), 248(6 to 7), 309(3 to 4), 319(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 40.000000), (221: 40.000000), (230: 55.000000), (231: 15.000000), (232: 25.000000), (248: 5.000000), (309: 10.000000), (319: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 9), (221: 7), (230: 9), (231: 8), (232: 6), (248: 10), (309: 8), (319: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 197 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
