The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 12), 219(12 to 5), 228(7 to 3), 229(10 to 6), 230(11 to 1), 246(6 to 7), 297(3 to 4), 311(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 40.000000), (219: 40.000000), (228: 25.000000), (229: 45.000000), (230: 15.000000), (246: 25.000000), (297: 10.000000), (311: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 9), (219: 7), (228: 6), (229: 11), (230: 4), (246: 5), (297: 8), (311: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
