The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
545(1 to 12), 546(12 to 5), 555(7 to 3), 556(10 to 6), 557(11 to 1), 569(6 to 7), 620(3 to 4), 629(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(545: 40.000000), (546: 40.000000), (555: 55.000000), (556: 15.000000), (557: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(545: 12), (546: 7), (555: 8), (556: 6), (557: 6), (569: 5), (620: 2), (629: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
