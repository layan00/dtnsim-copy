The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1677(1 to 12), 1678(12 to 5), 1686(7 to 3), 1687(10 to 6), 1688(11 to 1), 1709(6 to 7), 1762(3 to 4), 1767(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1678: 40.000000), (1686: 55.000000), (1687: 15.000000), (1688: 15.000000), (1709: 25.000000), (1767: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1677: 10), (1678: 7), (1686: 9), (1687: 10), (1688: 7), (1709: 5), (1762: 2), (1767: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
