The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1288(1 to 12), 1289(12 to 5), 1296(7 to 3), 1297(10 to 6), 1298(11 to 1), 1314(6 to 7), 1366(3 to 4), 1370(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1288: 80.000000), (1289: 40.000000), (1296: 55.000000), (1297: 15.000000), (1298: 15.000000), (1314: 55.000000), (1366: 10.000000), (1370: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1288: 9), (1289: 7), (1296: 9), (1297: 8), (1298: 5), (1314: 5), (1366: 2), (1370: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
