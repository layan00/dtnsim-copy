The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
577(1 to 12), 578(12 to 5), 586(7 to 3), 587(10 to 6), 588(11 to 1), 608(6 to 7), 660(3 to 4), 663(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(578: 40.000000), (586: 55.000000), (587: 15.000000), (588: 15.000000), (660: 10.000000), (663: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(577: 10), (578: 6), (586: 9), (587: 10), (588: 7), (660: 2), (663: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
