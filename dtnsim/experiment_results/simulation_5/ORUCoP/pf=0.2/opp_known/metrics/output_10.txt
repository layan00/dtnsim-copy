The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(1 to 12), 209(12 to 5), 218(7 to 3), 219(10 to 6), 220(11 to 1), 237(6 to 7), 279(3 to 4), 284(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(208: 40.000000), (209: 40.000000), (218: 45.000000), (219: 65.000000), (220: 15.000000), (279: 10.000000), (284: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 9), (209: 7), (218: 6), (219: 7), (220: 7), (279: 2), (284: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
