The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
359(1 to 12), 360(12 to 5), 369(7 to 3), 370(10 to 6), 371(11 to 1), 386(6 to 7), 402(3 to 4), 408(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(359: 80.000000), (360: 70.000000), (369: 25.000000), (370: 45.000000), (402: 10.000000), (408: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(359: 3), (360: 4), (369: 3), (370: 7), (371: 2), (386: 3), (402: 3), (408: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
