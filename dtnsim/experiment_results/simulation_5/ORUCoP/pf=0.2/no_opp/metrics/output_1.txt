The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
269(1 to 12), 270(12 to 5), 280(7 to 3), 281(10 to 6), 282(11 to 1), 295(6 to 7), 312(3 to 4), 317(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(269: 80.000000), (270: 70.000000), (281: 65.000000), (312: 10.000000), (317: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(269: 7), (270: 4), (281: 7), (282: 2), (295: 3), (312: 4), (317: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
