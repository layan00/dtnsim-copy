The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 12), 225(12 to 5), 233(7 to 3), 234(10 to 6), 235(11 to 1), 246(6 to 7), 263(3 to 4), 271(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 3), (233: 4), (234: 2), (235: 4), (246: 1), (263: 2), (271: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
