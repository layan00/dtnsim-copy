The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
88(1 to 12), 89(12 to 5), 100(7 to 3), 101(10 to 6), 102(11 to 1), 120(6 to 7), 152(3 to 4), 165(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(88: 30.000000), (89: 70.000000), (100: 25.000000), (101: 15.000000), (102: 25.000000), (120: 5.000000), (152: 10.000000), (165: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(88: 7), (89: 4), (100: 6), (101: 5), (102: 5), (120: 10), (152: 8), (165: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 82 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
