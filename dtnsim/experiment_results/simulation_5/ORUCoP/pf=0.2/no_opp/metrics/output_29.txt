The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
746(1 to 12), 747(12 to 5), 757(7 to 3), 758(10 to 6), 759(11 to 1), 781(6 to 7), 814(3 to 4), 821(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(746: 30.000000), (747: 40.000000), (757: 25.000000), (758: 15.000000), (759: 5.000000), (781: 25.000000), (814: 10.000000), (821: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(746: 6), (747: 6), (757: 6), (758: 8), (759: 6), (781: 5), (814: 4), (821: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
