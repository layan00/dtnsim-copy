The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
86(1 to 12), 87(12 to 5), 98(7 to 3), 99(10 to 6), 100(11 to 1), 118(6 to 7), 148(3 to 4), 161(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(86: 30.000000), (87: 40.000000), (98: 25.000000), (99: 45.000000), (100: 25.000000), (118: 25.000000), (148: 10.000000), (161: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(86: 7), (87: 5), (98: 6), (99: 11), (100: 5), (118: 5), (148: 8), (161: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
