The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
234(1 to 12), 235(12 to 5), 245(7 to 3), 246(10 to 6), 247(11 to 1), 266(6 to 7), 289(3 to 4), 293(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(235: 40.000000), (245: 25.000000), (246: 15.000000), (247: 5.000000), (293: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(234: 3), (235: 5), (245: 6), (246: 8), (247: 6), (266: 1), (293: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
