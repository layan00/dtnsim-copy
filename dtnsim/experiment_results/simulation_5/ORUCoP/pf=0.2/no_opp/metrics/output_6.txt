The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
262(1 to 12), 263(12 to 5), 273(7 to 3), 274(10 to 6), 275(11 to 1), 296(6 to 7), 324(3 to 4), 329(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(263: 40.000000), (273: 25.000000), (274: 15.000000), (275: 5.000000), (296: 25.000000), (324: 10.000000), (329: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(262: 3), (263: 5), (273: 6), (274: 8), (275: 6), (296: 5), (324: 2), (329: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
