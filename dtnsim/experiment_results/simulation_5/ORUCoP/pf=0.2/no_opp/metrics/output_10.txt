The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
76(1 to 12), 77(12 to 5), 87(7 to 3), 88(10 to 6), 89(11 to 1), 106(6 to 7), 126(3 to 4), 132(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(77: 40.000000), (87: 45.000000), (88: 45.000000), (89: 25.000000), (126: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(76: 4), (77: 5), (87: 6), (88: 9), (89: 6), (126: 2), (132: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
