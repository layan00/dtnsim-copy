The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
753(1 to 12), 754(12 to 5), 764(7 to 3), 765(10 to 6), 766(11 to 1), 787(6 to 7), 817(3 to 4), 821(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(753: 80.000000), (754: 40.000000), (764: 25.000000), (765: 15.000000), (766: 5.000000), (787: 25.000000), (821: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(753: 5), (754: 5), (764: 6), (765: 8), (766: 6), (787: 5), (821: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
