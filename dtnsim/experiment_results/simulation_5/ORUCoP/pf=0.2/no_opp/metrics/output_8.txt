The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
612(1 to 12), 613(12 to 5), 625(7 to 3), 626(10 to 6), 627(11 to 1), 649(6 to 7), 680(3 to 4), 687(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(612: 30.000000), (613: 40.000000), (625: 25.000000), (626: 15.000000), (627: 5.000000), (687: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(612: 5), (613: 5), (625: 6), (626: 8), (627: 6), (649: 4), (680: 3), (687: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
