The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
437(1 to 12), 438(12 to 5), 447(7 to 3), 448(10 to 6), 449(11 to 1), 465(6 to 7), 493(3 to 4), 502(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(437: 80.000000), (438: 40.000000), (447: 25.000000), (448: 15.000000), (449: 25.000000), (465: 25.000000), (493: 10.000000), (502: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(437: 3), (438: 5), (447: 4), (448: 7), (449: 6), (465: 5), (493: 4), (502: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
