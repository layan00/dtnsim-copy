The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
429(1 to 12), 430(12 to 5), 442(7 to 3), 443(10 to 6), 444(11 to 1), 462(6 to 7), 482(3 to 4), 488(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(429: 30.000000), (430: 70.000000), (442: 25.000000), (443: 15.000000), (482: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(429: 5), (430: 4), (442: 4), (443: 6), (444: 3), (462: 3), (482: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
