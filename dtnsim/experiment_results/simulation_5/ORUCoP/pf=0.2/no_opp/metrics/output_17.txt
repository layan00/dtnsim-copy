The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
388(1 to 12), 389(12 to 5), 399(7 to 3), 400(10 to 6), 401(11 to 1), 420(6 to 7), 436(3 to 4), 441(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(389: 70.000000), (399: 25.000000), (400: 15.000000), (401: 5.000000), (436: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(388: 2), (389: 3), (399: 6), (400: 6), (401: 4), (436: 2), (441: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
