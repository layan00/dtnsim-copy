The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
422(1 to 12), 423(12 to 5), 431(7 to 3), 432(10 to 6), 433(11 to 1), 451(6 to 7), 469(3 to 4), 476(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(422: 30.000000), (431: 25.000000), (432: 15.000000), (469: 10.000000), (476: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(422: 7), (431: 6), (432: 5), (451: 2), (469: 4), (476: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
