The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
78(1 to 12), 79(12 to 5), 87(7 to 3), 88(10 to 6), 89(11 to 1), 109(6 to 7), 133(3 to 4), 140(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(78: 80.000000), (79: 50.000000), (87: 25.000000), (88: 15.000000), (89: 5.000000), (140: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 4), (79: 8), (87: 5), (88: 6), (89: 4), (109: 1), (133: 2), (140: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
