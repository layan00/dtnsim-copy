The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
77(1 to 12), 78(12 to 5), 86(7 to 3), 87(10 to 6), 88(11 to 1), 99(6 to 7), 127(3 to 4), 134(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(77: 80.000000), (78: 40.000000), (87: 15.000000), (88: 25.000000), (99: 55.000000), (127: 10.000000), (134: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(77: 5), (78: 5), (86: 2), (87: 5), (88: 6), (99: 5), (127: 2), (134: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
