The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
746(1 to 12), 747(12 to 5), 759(7 to 3), 760(10 to 6), 761(11 to 1), 776(6 to 7), 790(3 to 4), 796(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(746: 80.000000), (747: 70.000000), (759: 45.000000), (760: 45.000000), (761: 5.000000), (796: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(746: 7), (747: 4), (759: 4), (760: 8), (761: 4), (776: 1), (796: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
