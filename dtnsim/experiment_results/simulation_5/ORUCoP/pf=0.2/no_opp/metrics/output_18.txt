The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
543(1 to 12), 544(12 to 5), 556(7 to 3), 557(10 to 6), 558(11 to 1), 576(6 to 7), 591(3 to 4), 598(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(543: 30.000000), (544: 70.000000), (556: 45.000000), (557: 45.000000), (558: 5.000000), (591: 10.000000), (598: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(543: 5), (544: 4), (556: 4), (557: 8), (558: 4), (576: 3), (591: 2), (598: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
