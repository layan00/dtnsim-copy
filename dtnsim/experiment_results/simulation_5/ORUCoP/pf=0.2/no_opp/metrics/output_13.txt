The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
521(1 to 12), 522(12 to 5), 532(7 to 3), 533(10 to 6), 534(11 to 1), 552(6 to 7), 577(3 to 4), 596(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(521: 30.000000), (522: 40.000000), (532: 25.000000), (533: 45.000000), (534: 5.000000), (552: 25.000000), (577: 10.000000), (596: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(521: 7), (522: 4), (532: 5), (533: 10), (534: 6), (552: 5), (577: 8), (596: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
