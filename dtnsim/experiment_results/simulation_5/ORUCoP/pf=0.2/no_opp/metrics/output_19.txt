The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
703(1 to 12), 704(12 to 5), 713(7 to 3), 714(10 to 6), 715(11 to 1), 736(6 to 7), 754(3 to 4), 759(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(703: 80.000000), (704: 70.000000), (713: 25.000000), (714: 15.000000), (715: 5.000000), (754: 10.000000), (759: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(703: 3), (704: 3), (713: 6), (714: 6), (715: 4), (736: 2), (754: 2), (759: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
