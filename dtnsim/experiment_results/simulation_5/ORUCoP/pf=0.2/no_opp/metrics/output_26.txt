The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
242(1 to 12), 243(12 to 5), 253(7 to 3), 254(10 to 6), 255(11 to 1), 278(6 to 7), 298(3 to 4), 308(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 30.000000), (253: 25.000000), (254: 45.000000), (255: 5.000000), (308: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(242: 7), (243: 1), (253: 6), (254: 11), (255: 6), (278: 2), (298: 4), (308: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
