The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
578(1 to 12), 579(12 to 5), 598(7 to 3), 599(10 to 6), 600(11 to 1), 605(6 to 7), 645(3 to 4), 648(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(578: 80.000000), (600: 25.000000), (648: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(578: 6), (600: 4), (605: 6), (648: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 160 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
