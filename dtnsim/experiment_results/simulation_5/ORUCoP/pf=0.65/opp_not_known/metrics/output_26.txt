The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
549(1 to 12), 550(12 to 5), 571(7 to 3), 572(10 to 6), 573(11 to 1), 580(6 to 7), 615(3 to 4), 620(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(571: 45.000000), (572: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(549: 4), (571: 4), (572: 7), (573: 3), (620: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 177 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
