The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
945(1 to 12), 946(12 to 5), 971(7 to 3), 972(10 to 6), 973(11 to 1), 980(6 to 7), 1019(3 to 4), 1027(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(945: 80.000000), (946: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(945: 6), (946: 7), (972: 2), (973: 4), (1019: 6), (1027: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 146 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
