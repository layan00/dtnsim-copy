The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1336(1 to 12), 1337(12 to 5), 1356(7 to 3), 1357(10 to 6), 1358(11 to 1), 1364(6 to 7), 1407(3 to 4), 1419(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1336: 4), (1356: 2), (1357: 4), (1358: 6), (1364: 8), (1407: 2), (1419: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 210 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
