The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1732(1 to 12), 1733(12 to 5), 1753(7 to 3), 1754(10 to 6), 1755(11 to 1), 1762(6 to 7), 1795(3 to 4), 1799(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1755: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1732: 4), (1754: 2), (1755: 6), (1795: 2), (1799: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 178 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
