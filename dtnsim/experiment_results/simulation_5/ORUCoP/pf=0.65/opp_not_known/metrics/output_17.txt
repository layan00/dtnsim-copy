The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
958(1 to 12), 959(12 to 5), 980(7 to 3), 981(10 to 6), 982(11 to 1), 987(6 to 7), 1018(3 to 4), 1024(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(958: 80.000000), (1018: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(958: 6), (980: 2), (982: 3), (1018: 4), (1024: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 26 calls to RUCoP, which took 118 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
