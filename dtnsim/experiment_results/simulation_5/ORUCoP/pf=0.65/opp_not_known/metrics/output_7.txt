The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
980(1 to 12), 981(12 to 5), 1002(7 to 3), 1003(10 to 6), 1004(11 to 1), 1015(6 to 7), 1051(3 to 4), 1056(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(980: 4), (1002: 4), (1003: 4), (1004: 5), (1051: 2), (1056: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 221 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
