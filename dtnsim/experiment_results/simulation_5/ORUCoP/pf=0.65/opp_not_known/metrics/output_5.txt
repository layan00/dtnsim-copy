The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(1 to 12), 181(12 to 5), 202(7 to 3), 203(10 to 6), 204(11 to 1), 211(6 to 7), 262(3 to 4), 268(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(262: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(180: 10), (181: 8), (203: 1), (204: 4), (211: 4), (262: 4), (268: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 191 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
