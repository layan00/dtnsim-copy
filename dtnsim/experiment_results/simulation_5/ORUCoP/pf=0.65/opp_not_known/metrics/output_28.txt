The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1347(1 to 12), 1348(12 to 5), 1369(7 to 3), 1370(10 to 6), 1371(11 to 1), 1380(6 to 7), 1419(3 to 4), 1423(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1370: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1347: 3), (1348: 6), (1369: 2), (1370: 4), (1371: 3), (1419: 2), (1423: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
