The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
611(1 to 12), 612(12 to 5), 633(7 to 3), 634(10 to 6), 635(11 to 1), 649(6 to 7), 686(3 to 4), 693(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(634: 65.000000), (635: 25.000000), (686: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(611: 4), (612: 4), (633: 2), (634: 6), (635: 5), (686: 4), (693: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 214 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
