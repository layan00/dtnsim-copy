The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1833(1 to 12), 1834(12 to 5), 1853(7 to 3), 1854(10 to 6), 1855(11 to 1), 1863(6 to 7), 1903(3 to 4), 1907(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1833: 80.000000), (1907: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1833: 6), (1834: 6), (1854: 4), (1855: 4), (1907: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 213 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
