The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
586(1 to 12), 587(12 to 5), 608(7 to 3), 609(10 to 6), 610(11 to 1), 617(6 to 7), 670(3 to 4), 676(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(586: 80.000000), (670: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(586: 6), (587: 6), (609: 5), (610: 4), (617: 11), (670: 4), (676: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 221 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
