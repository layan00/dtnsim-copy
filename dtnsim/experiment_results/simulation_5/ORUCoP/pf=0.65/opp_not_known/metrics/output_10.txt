The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
187(1 to 12), 188(12 to 5), 209(7 to 3), 210(10 to 6), 211(11 to 1), 221(6 to 7), 254(3 to 4), 256(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(210: 65.000000), (211: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(187: 4), (188: 4), (209: 4), (210: 3), (211: 5), (256: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 54 calls to RUCoP, which took 226 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
