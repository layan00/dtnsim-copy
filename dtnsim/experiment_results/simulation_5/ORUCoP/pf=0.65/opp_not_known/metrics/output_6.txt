The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
585(1 to 12), 586(12 to 5), 604(7 to 3), 605(10 to 6), 606(11 to 1), 619(6 to 7), 662(3 to 4), 665(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(606: 25.000000), (665: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(585: 3), (604: 5), (605: 3), (606: 5), (619: 4), (662: 2), (665: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 204 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
