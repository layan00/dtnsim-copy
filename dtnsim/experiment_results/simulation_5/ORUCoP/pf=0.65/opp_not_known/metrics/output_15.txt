The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
188(1 to 12), 189(12 to 5), 207(7 to 3), 208(10 to 6), 209(11 to 1), 214(6 to 7), 259(3 to 4), 262(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(188: 80.000000), (209: 25.000000), (262: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(188: 7), (208: 2), (209: 5), (214: 6), (262: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 174 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
