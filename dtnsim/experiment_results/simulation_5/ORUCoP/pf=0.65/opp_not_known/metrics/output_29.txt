The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1742(1 to 12), 1743(12 to 5), 1763(7 to 3), 1764(10 to 6), 1765(11 to 1), 1778(6 to 7), 1820(3 to 4), 1826(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1742: 6), (1763: 6), (1764: 2), (1765: 4), (1778: 4), (1826: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 64 calls to RUCoP, which took 267 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
