The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1757(1 to 12), 1758(12 to 5), 1778(7 to 3), 1779(10 to 6), 1780(11 to 1), 1789(6 to 7), 1827(3 to 4), 1833(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1757: 80.000000), (1758: 50.000000), (1779: 65.000000), (1833: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1757: 6), (1758: 6), (1779: 5), (1780: 4), (1833: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 182 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
