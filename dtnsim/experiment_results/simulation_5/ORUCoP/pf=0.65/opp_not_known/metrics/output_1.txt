The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
580(1 to 12), 581(12 to 5), 601(7 to 3), 602(10 to 6), 603(11 to 1), 611(6 to 7), 648(3 to 4), 652(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(648: 10.000000), (652: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(580: 4), (603: 3), (611: 4), (648: 4), (652: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 32 calls to RUCoP, which took 146 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
