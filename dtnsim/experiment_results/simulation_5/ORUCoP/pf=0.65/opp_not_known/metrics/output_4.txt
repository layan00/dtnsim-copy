The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1732(1 to 12), 1733(12 to 5), 1752(7 to 3), 1753(10 to 6), 1754(11 to 1), 1759(6 to 7), 1798(3 to 4), 1802(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1732: 40.000000), (1752: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1732: 7), (1752: 4), (1754: 3), (1802: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 181 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
