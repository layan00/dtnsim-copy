The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
961(1 to 12), 962(12 to 5), 984(7 to 3), 985(10 to 6), 986(11 to 1), 995(6 to 7), 1030(3 to 4), 1036(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(961: 4), (962: 8), (984: 2), (985: 3), (986: 3), (1030: 2), (1036: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 219 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
