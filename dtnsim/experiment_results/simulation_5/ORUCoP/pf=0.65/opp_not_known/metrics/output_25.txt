The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
172(1 to 12), 173(12 to 5), 191(7 to 3), 192(10 to 6), 193(11 to 1), 200(6 to 7), 238(3 to 4), 240(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(172: 3), (192: 1), (193: 3), (200: 8), (238: 2), (240: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 40 calls to RUCoP, which took 168 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
