The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
151(1 to 12), 152(12 to 5), 157(7 to 3), 158(10 to 6), 159(11 to 1), 173(6 to 7), 184(3 to 4), 189(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(184: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(151: 1), (152: 4), (157: 2), (158: 6), (159: 2), (184: 2), (189: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
