The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
345(1 to 12), 346(12 to 5), 350(7 to 3), 351(10 to 6), 352(11 to 1), 359(6 to 7), 364(3 to 4), 366(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(351: 2), (366: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
