The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
36(1 to 12), 37(12 to 5), 41(7 to 3), 42(10 to 6), 43(11 to 1), 50(6 to 7), 63(3 to 4), 66(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(63: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(37: 1), (42: 1), (43: 2), (50: 2), (63: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 63: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 63: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 50: (to: 9, time: 35.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 43: (to: 5, time: 40.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 50: (to: 12, time: 35.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 42: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), 
Node 11: 
Bundle 43: (to: 8, time: 40.000000), 
Node 12: 
Bundle 37: (to: 9, time: 0.000000),
