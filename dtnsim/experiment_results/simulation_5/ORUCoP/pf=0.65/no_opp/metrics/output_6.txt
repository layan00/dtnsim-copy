The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
116(1 to 12), 117(12 to 5), 122(7 to 3), 123(10 to 6), 124(11 to 1), 137(6 to 7), 149(3 to 4), 151(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(116: 2), (122: 4), (123: 1), (124: 2), (137: 2), (151: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 116: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 137: (to: 9, time: 35.000000),
