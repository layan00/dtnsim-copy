The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
44(1 to 12), 45(12 to 5), 50(7 to 3), 51(10 to 6), 52(11 to 1), 57(6 to 7), 72(3 to 4), 75(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(44: 80.000000), (52: 25.000000), (75: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(44: 5), (51: 2), (52: 5), (57: 1), (75: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 44: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
