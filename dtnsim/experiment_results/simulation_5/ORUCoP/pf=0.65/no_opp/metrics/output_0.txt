The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
44(1 to 12), 45(12 to 5), 51(7 to 3), 52(10 to 6), 53(11 to 1), 65(6 to 7), 71(3 to 4), 77(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(71: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(51: 4), (52: 2), (71: 4), (77: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 83 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 71: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 71: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 51: (to: 8, time: 30.000000), (to: 8, time: 30.000000), 
Bundle 52: (to: 8, time: 30.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 51: (to: 5, time: 50.000000), (to: 5, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 77: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), 
Node 9:
