The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
350(1 to 12), 351(12 to 5), 355(7 to 3), 356(10 to 6), 357(11 to 1), 366(6 to 7), 379(3 to 4), 384(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(351: 50.000000), (356: 65.000000), (384: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(351: 6), (356: 5), (357: 2), (384: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
