The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
271(1 to 12), 272(12 to 5), 279(7 to 3), 280(10 to 6), 281(11 to 1), 290(6 to 7), 305(3 to 4), 309(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(272: 40.000000), (280: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(271: 1), (272: 4), (279: 2), (280: 4), (281: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
