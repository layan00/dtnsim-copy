The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
344(1 to 12), 345(12 to 5), 350(7 to 3), 351(10 to 6), 352(11 to 1), 359(6 to 7), 362(3 to 4), 364(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(344: 80.000000), (351: 65.000000), (364: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(344: 3), (345: 1), (351: 4), (352: 1), (364: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
