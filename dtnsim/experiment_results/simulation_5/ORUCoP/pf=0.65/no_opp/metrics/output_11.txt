The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
134(1 to 12), 135(12 to 5), 140(7 to 3), 141(10 to 6), 142(11 to 1), 149(6 to 7), 169(3 to 4), 172(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(169: 10.000000), (172: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(135: 6), (141: 2), (142: 2), (149: 1), (169: 2), (172: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
