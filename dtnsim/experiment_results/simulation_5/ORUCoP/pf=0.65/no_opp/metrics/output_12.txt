The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
232(1 to 12), 233(12 to 5), 238(7 to 3), 239(10 to 6), 240(11 to 1), 247(6 to 7), 254(3 to 4), 257(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(254: 10.000000), (257: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(233: 1), (238: 1), (239: 2), (254: 2), (257: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 254: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 254: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 238: (to: 8, time: 30.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 257: (to: 7, time: 60.000000), (to: 12, time: 80.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 239: (to: 7, time: 40.000000), (to: 8, time: 80.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 233: (to: 9, time: 0.000000),
