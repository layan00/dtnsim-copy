The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
128(1 to 12), 129(12 to 5), 133(7 to 3), 134(10 to 6), 135(11 to 1), 143(6 to 7), 152(3 to 4), 155(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(152: 10.000000), (155: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(128: 2), (135: 1), (143: 2), (152: 2), (155: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 128: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 152: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 152: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 128: (to: 8, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 143: (to: 9, time: 35.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 155: (to: 4, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 155: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), (to: 7, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 143: (to: 12, time: 35.000000), 
Node 10: 
Node 11:
