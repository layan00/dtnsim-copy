The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
266(1 to 12), 267(12 to 5), 272(7 to 3), 273(10 to 6), 274(11 to 1), 283(6 to 7), 290(3 to 4), 295(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(266: 80.000000), (272: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(266: 4), (272: 4), (273: 3), (283: 2), (295: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 266: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
