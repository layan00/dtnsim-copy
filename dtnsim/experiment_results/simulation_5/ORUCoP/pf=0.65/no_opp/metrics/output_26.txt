The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
97(1 to 12), 98(12 to 5), 103(7 to 3), 104(10 to 6), 105(11 to 1), 112(6 to 7), 119(3 to 4), 124(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(103: 45.000000), (104: 45.000000), (124: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(97: 2), (103: 4), (104: 5), (105: 1), (124: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 97: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 103: (to: 3, time: 70.000000), (to: 3, time: 70.000000), 
Bundle 104: (to: 3, time: 70.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 104: (to: 6, time: 70.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 97: (to: 8, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 103: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 104: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 124: (to: 4, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8:
