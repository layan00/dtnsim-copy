The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
430(1 to 12), 431(12 to 5), 436(7 to 3), 437(10 to 6), 438(11 to 1), 446(6 to 7), 451(3 to 4), 453(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(430: 80.000000), (453: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(430: 4), (431: 1), (437: 1), (453: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 430: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 430: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Bundle 430: (to: 8, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 430: (to: 12, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 453: (to: 7, time: 60.000000), (to: 12, time: 80.000000), 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Bundle 437: (to: 11, time: 30.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 431: (to: 9, time: 0.000000), 
Bundle 453: (to: 4, time: 100.000000),
