The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
413(1 to 12), 414(12 to 5), 418(7 to 3), 419(10 to 6), 420(11 to 1), 430(6 to 7), 443(3 to 4), 446(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(419: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(413: 2), (414: 4), (418: 2), (419: 4), (420: 1), (430: 1), (443: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
