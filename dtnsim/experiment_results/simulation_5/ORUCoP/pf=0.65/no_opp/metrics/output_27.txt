The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
188(1 to 12), 189(12 to 5), 197(7 to 3), 198(10 to 6), 199(11 to 1), 206(6 to 7), 215(3 to 4), 219(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 2), (198: 2), (215: 2), (219: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Bundle 215: (to: 5, time: 50.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 215: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 198: (to: 4, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 219: (to: 12, time: 80.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 189: (to: 6, time: 20.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 198: (to: 7, time: 25.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 189: (to: 9, time: 0.000000),
