The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
248(1 to 12), 249(12 to 5), 253(7 to 3), 254(10 to 6), 255(11 to 1), 265(6 to 7), 279(3 to 4), 284(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(248: 80.000000), (254: 15.000000), (279: 10.000000), (284: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(248: 3), (253: 2), (254: 4), (265: 1), (279: 4), (284: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
