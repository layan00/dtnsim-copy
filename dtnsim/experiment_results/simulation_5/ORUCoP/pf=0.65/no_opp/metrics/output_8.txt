The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
279(1 to 12), 280(12 to 5), 286(7 to 3), 287(10 to 6), 288(11 to 1), 295(6 to 7), 301(3 to 4), 303(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(303: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(279: 2), (280: 1), (287: 1), (295: 1), (303: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 279: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 279: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 295: (to: 9, time: 35.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 303: (to: 5, time: 55.000000), (to: 12, time: 80.000000), 
Node 9:
