The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
175(1 to 12), 176(12 to 5), 183(7 to 3), 184(10 to 6), 185(11 to 1), 195(6 to 7), 220(3 to 4), 222(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(184: 65.000000), (185: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(175: 4), (176: 2), (183: 2), (184: 3), (185: 5), (222: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
