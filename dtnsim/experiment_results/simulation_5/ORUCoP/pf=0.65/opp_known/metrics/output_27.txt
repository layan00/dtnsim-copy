The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
696(1 to 12), 697(12 to 5), 707(7 to 3), 708(10 to 6), 709(11 to 1), 716(6 to 7), 743(3 to 4), 748(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(696: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(696: 6), (697: 2), (708: 2), (709: 5), (743: 2), (748: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
