The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
471(1 to 12), 472(12 to 5), 479(7 to 3), 480(10 to 6), 481(11 to 1), 495(6 to 7), 523(3 to 4), 527(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(472: 40.000000), (480: 65.000000), (481: 15.000000), (523: 10.000000), (527: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(471: 4), (472: 3), (479: 2), (480: 4), (481: 7), (523: 2), (527: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
