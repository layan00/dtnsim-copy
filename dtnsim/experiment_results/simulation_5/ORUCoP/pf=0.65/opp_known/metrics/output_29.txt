The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1257(1 to 12), 1258(12 to 5), 1265(7 to 3), 1266(10 to 6), 1267(11 to 1), 1280(6 to 7), 1309(3 to 4), 1316(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1316: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1257: 6), (1265: 6), (1266: 2), (1267: 5), (1280: 2), (1316: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
