The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
417(1 to 12), 418(12 to 5), 425(7 to 3), 426(10 to 6), 427(11 to 1), 434(6 to 7), 459(3 to 4), 464(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(425: 45.000000), (426: 45.000000), (464: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(417: 4), (425: 4), (426: 7), (427: 3), (464: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
