The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1322(1 to 12), 1323(12 to 5), 1329(7 to 3), 1330(10 to 6), 1331(11 to 1), 1341(6 to 7), 1373(3 to 4), 1377(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1323: 40.000000), (1330: 65.000000), (1331: 15.000000), (1377: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1322: 4), (1323: 3), (1329: 2), (1330: 4), (1331: 5), (1341: 4), (1373: 1), (1377: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
