The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
176(1 to 12), 177(12 to 5), 182(7 to 3), 183(10 to 6), 184(11 to 1), 189(6 to 7), 224(3 to 4), 226(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(176: 40.000000), (184: 15.000000), (226: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(176: 9), (183: 2), (184: 5), (189: 3), (226: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
