The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(1 to 12), 190(12 to 5), 198(7 to 3), 199(10 to 6), 200(11 to 1), 208(6 to 7), 239(3 to 4), 245(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(189: 80.000000), (190: 50.000000), (200: 15.000000), (245: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 6), (190: 5), (199: 1), (200: 4), (208: 2), (239: 2), (245: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
