The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
972(1 to 12), 973(12 to 5), 980(7 to 3), 981(10 to 6), 982(11 to 1), 992(6 to 7), 1030(3 to 4), 1034(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(973: 40.000000), (981: 15.000000), (982: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(972: 6), (973: 6), (980: 2), (981: 8), (982: 4), (1034: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
