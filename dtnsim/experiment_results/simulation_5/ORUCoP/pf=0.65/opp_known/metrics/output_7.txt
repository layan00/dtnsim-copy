The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
728(1 to 12), 729(12 to 5), 736(7 to 3), 737(10 to 6), 738(11 to 1), 750(6 to 7), 777(3 to 4), 781(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(728: 4), (736: 3), (737: 6), (738: 3), (781: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
