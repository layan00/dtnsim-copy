The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
995(1 to 12), 996(12 to 5), 1002(7 to 3), 1003(10 to 6), 1004(11 to 1), 1011(6 to 7), 1039(3 to 4), 1041(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(995: 80.000000), (996: 70.000000), (1041: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(995: 5), (996: 5), (1003: 1), (1004: 4), (1011: 3), (1041: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
