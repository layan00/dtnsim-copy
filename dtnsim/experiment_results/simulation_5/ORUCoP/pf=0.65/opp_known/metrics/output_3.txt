The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
969(1 to 12), 970(12 to 5), 975(7 to 3), 976(10 to 6), 977(11 to 1), 983(6 to 7), 1014(3 to 4), 1022(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(977: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(969: 4), (975: 2), (976: 4), (977: 5), (983: 4), (1014: 1), (1022: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
