The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1260(1 to 12), 1261(12 to 5), 1267(7 to 3), 1268(10 to 6), 1269(11 to 1), 1278(6 to 7), 1309(3 to 4), 1311(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1260: 80.000000), (1261: 40.000000), (1269: 15.000000), (1311: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1260: 6), (1261: 3), (1268: 5), (1269: 5), (1311: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
