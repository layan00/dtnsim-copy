The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
968(1 to 12), 969(12 to 5), 974(7 to 3), 975(10 to 6), 976(11 to 1), 985(6 to 7), 1013(3 to 4), 1018(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(968: 80.000000), (974: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(968: 9), (974: 4), (975: 3), (976: 4), (985: 2), (1018: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
