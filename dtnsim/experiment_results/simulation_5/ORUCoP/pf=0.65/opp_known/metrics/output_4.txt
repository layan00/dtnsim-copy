The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1240(1 to 12), 1241(12 to 5), 1247(7 to 3), 1248(10 to 6), 1249(11 to 1), 1254(6 to 7), 1282(3 to 4), 1286(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1240: 40.000000), (1247: 45.000000), (1286: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1240: 7), (1247: 4), (1249: 3), (1286: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
