The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
753(1 to 12), 754(12 to 5), 761(7 to 3), 762(10 to 6), 763(11 to 1), 770(6 to 7), 797(3 to 4), 801(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(753: 80.000000), (797: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(753: 6), (754: 4), (761: 1), (762: 2), (763: 4), (797: 2), (801: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
