The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
160(1 to 12), 161(12 to 5), 166(7 to 3), 167(10 to 6), 168(11 to 1), 175(6 to 7), 199(3 to 4), 201(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(160: 3), (167: 1), (168: 3), (175: 3), (201: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
