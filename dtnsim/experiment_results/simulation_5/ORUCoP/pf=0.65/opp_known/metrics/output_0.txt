The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
176(1 to 12), 177(12 to 5), 185(7 to 3), 186(10 to 6), 187(11 to 1), 199(6 to 7), 223(3 to 4), 229(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(176: 4), (185: 4), (186: 2), (187: 4), (223: 4), (229: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 188 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
