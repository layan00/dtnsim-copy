The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
715(1 to 12), 716(12 to 5), 723(7 to 3), 724(10 to 6), 725(11 to 1), 735(6 to 7), 760(3 to 4), 764(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(715: 4), (716: 4), (723: 1), (724: 6), (725: 3), (760: 1), (764: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
