The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1328(1 to 12), 1329(12 to 5), 1334(7 to 3), 1335(10 to 6), 1336(11 to 1), 1345(6 to 7), 1374(3 to 4), 1378(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1328: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1328: 5), (1329: 3), (1335: 7), (1336: 4), (1378: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
