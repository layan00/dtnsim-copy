The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
168(1 to 12), 169(12 to 5), 175(7 to 3), 176(10 to 6), 177(11 to 1), 184(6 to 7), 222(3 to 4), 226(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(177: 15.000000), (222: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(168: 10), (169: 4), (176: 1), (177: 5), (184: 2), (222: 2), (226: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
