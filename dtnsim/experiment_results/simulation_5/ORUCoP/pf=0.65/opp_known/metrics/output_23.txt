The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1054(1 to 12), 1055(12 to 5), 1062(7 to 3), 1063(10 to 6), 1064(11 to 1), 1071(6 to 7), 1092(3 to 4), 1094(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1054: 80.000000), (1063: 65.000000), (1064: 55.000000), (1094: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1054: 6), (1055: 3), (1063: 2), (1064: 6), (1094: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
