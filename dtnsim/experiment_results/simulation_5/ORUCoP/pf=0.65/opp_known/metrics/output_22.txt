The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
755(1 to 12), 756(12 to 5), 762(7 to 3), 763(10 to 6), 764(11 to 1), 774(6 to 7), 814(3 to 4), 826(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(755: 40.000000), (763: 15.000000), (764: 25.000000), (814: 10.000000), (826: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(755: 10), (762: 2), (763: 4), (764: 9), (774: 8), (814: 4), (826: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
