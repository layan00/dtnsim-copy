The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1238(1 to 12), 1239(12 to 5), 1245(7 to 3), 1246(10 to 6), 1247(11 to 1), 1254(6 to 7), 1277(3 to 4), 1281(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1247: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1238: 4), (1246: 1), (1247: 6), (1281: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1238: (to: 13, time: 0.000000), (to: 13, time: 40.000000),
