The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
704(1 to 12), 705(12 to 5), 712(7 to 3), 713(10 to 6), 714(11 to 1), 719(6 to 7), 740(3 to 4), 745(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(704: 80.000000), (740: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(704: 6), (712: 2), (714: 3), (740: 2), (745: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
