The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
731(1 to 12), 732(12 to 5), 736(7 to 3), 737(10 to 6), 738(11 to 1), 740(6 to 7), 764(3 to 4), 768(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(738: 25.000000), (768: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(731: 7), (732: 2), (736: 1), (737: 3), (738: 5), (740: 5), (764: 1), (768: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
