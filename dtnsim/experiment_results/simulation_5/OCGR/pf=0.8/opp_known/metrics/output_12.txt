The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
736(1 to 12), 737(12 to 5), 744(7 to 3), 745(10 to 6), 746(11 to 1), 747(6 to 7), 763(3 to 4), 768(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(736: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(736: 5), (737: 6), (744: 1), (745: 4), (746: 5), (747: 1), (763: 2), (768: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
