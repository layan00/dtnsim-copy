The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
736(1 to 12), 737(12 to 5), 741(7 to 3), 742(10 to 6), 743(11 to 1), 747(6 to 7), 764(3 to 4), 767(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(736: 5), (737: 2), (741: 3), (742: 4), (743: 2), (747: 1), (764: 1), (767: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
