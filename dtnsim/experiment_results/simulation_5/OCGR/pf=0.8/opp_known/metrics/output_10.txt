The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
192(1 to 12), 193(12 to 5), 199(7 to 3), 200(10 to 6), 201(11 to 1), 204(6 to 7), 221(3 to 4), 222(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(192: 5), (193: 6), (199: 1), (200: 4), (201: 4), (204: 1), (221: 1), (222: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
