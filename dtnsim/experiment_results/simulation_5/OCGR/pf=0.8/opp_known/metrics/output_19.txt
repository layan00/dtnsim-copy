The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1250(1 to 12), 1251(12 to 5), 1255(7 to 3), 1256(10 to 6), 1257(11 to 1), 1259(6 to 7), 1273(3 to 4), 1276(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1250: 5), (1251: 2), (1255: 1), (1256: 4), (1257: 5), (1259: 1), (1273: 1), (1276: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
