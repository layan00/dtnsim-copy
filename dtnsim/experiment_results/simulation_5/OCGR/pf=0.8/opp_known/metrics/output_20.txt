The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
199(1 to 12), 200(12 to 5), 203(7 to 3), 204(10 to 6), 205(11 to 1), 208(6 to 7), 230(3 to 4), 236(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(199: 5), (200: 2), (203: 1), (204: 3), (205: 5), (208: 7), (230: 2), (236: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
