The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
470(1 to 12), 471(12 to 5), 476(7 to 3), 477(10 to 6), 478(11 to 1), 482(6 to 7), 496(3 to 4), 497(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(470: 5), (471: 2), (476: 1), (477: 3), (478: 5), (482: 1), (496: 1), (497: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
