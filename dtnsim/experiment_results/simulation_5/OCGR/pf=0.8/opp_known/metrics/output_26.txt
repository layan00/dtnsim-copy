The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
443(1 to 12), 444(12 to 5), 448(7 to 3), 449(10 to 6), 450(11 to 1), 453(6 to 7), 467(3 to 4), 473(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(443: 5), (444: 2), (448: 3), (449: 5), (450: 5), (453: 1), (467: 1), (473: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
