The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
189(1 to 12), 190(12 to 5), 192(7 to 3), 193(10 to 6), 194(11 to 1), 196(6 to 7), 209(3 to 4), 212(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(189: 3), (190: 2), (192: 1), (193: 3), (194: 5), (196: 1), (209: 1), (212: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
