The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
464(1 to 12), 465(12 to 5), 468(7 to 3), 469(10 to 6), 470(11 to 1), 471(6 to 7), 486(3 to 4), 489(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(464: 5), (465: 2), (468: 1), (469: 3), (470: 5), (471: 1), (486: 1), (489: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
