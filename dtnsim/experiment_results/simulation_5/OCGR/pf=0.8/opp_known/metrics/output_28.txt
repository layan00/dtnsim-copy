The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
991(1 to 12), 992(12 to 5), 1000(7 to 3), 1001(10 to 6), 1002(11 to 1), 1009(6 to 7), 1032(3 to 4), 1033(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(992: 30.000000), (1001: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(991: 7), (992: 4), (1000: 1), (1001: 4), (1002: 2), (1009: 1), (1032: 1), (1033: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
