The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1271(1 to 12), 1272(12 to 5), 1274(7 to 3), 1275(10 to 6), 1276(11 to 1), 1278(6 to 7), 1293(3 to 4), 1296(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1271: 5), (1272: 2), (1274: 1), (1275: 3), (1276: 5), (1278: 1), (1293: 1), (1296: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
