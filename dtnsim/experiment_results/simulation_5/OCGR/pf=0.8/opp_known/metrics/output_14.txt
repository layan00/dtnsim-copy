The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1278(1 to 12), 1279(12 to 5), 1283(7 to 3), 1284(10 to 6), 1285(11 to 1), 1286(6 to 7), 1305(3 to 4), 1308(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1279: 40.000000), (1284: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1278: 5), (1279: 4), (1283: 1), (1284: 6), (1285: 5), (1286: 1), (1305: 1), (1308: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
