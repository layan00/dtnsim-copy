The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
721(1 to 12), 722(12 to 5), 726(7 to 3), 727(10 to 6), 728(11 to 1), 729(6 to 7), 744(3 to 4), 748(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(721: 80.000000), (744: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(721: 5), (722: 2), (726: 1), (727: 3), (728: 5), (729: 1), (744: 2), (748: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
