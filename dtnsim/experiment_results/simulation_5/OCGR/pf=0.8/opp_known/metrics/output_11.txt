The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
460(1 to 12), 461(12 to 5), 465(7 to 3), 466(10 to 6), 467(11 to 1), 469(6 to 7), 495(3 to 4), 498(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(460: 40.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(460: 7), (461: 2), (465: 1), (466: 4), (467: 5), (469: 5), (495: 1), (498: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
