The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
994(1 to 12), 995(12 to 5), 998(7 to 3), 999(10 to 6), 1000(11 to 1), 1001(6 to 7), 1019(3 to 4), 1025(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(994: 5), (995: 2), (998: 3), (999: 4), (1000: 5), (1001: 1), (1019: 2), (1025: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
