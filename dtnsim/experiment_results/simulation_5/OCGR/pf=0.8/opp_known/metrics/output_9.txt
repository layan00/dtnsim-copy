The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1266(1 to 12), 1267(12 to 5), 1270(7 to 3), 1271(10 to 6), 1272(11 to 1), 1274(6 to 7), 1290(3 to 4), 1293(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1266: 80.000000), (1293: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1266: 5), (1267: 2), (1270: 1), (1271: 5), (1272: 5), (1274: 1), (1290: 1), (1293: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
