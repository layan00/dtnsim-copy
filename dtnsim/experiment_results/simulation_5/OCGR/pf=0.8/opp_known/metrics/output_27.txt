The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
712(1 to 12), 713(12 to 5), 720(7 to 3), 721(10 to 6), 722(11 to 1), 725(6 to 7), 745(3 to 4), 751(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(713: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(712: 5), (713: 6), (720: 1), (721: 5), (722: 5), (725: 1), (745: 2), (751: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
