The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1004(1 to 12), 1005(12 to 5), 1012(7 to 3), 1013(10 to 6), 1014(11 to 1), 1018(6 to 7), 1031(3 to 4), 1032(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1004: 80.000000), (1032: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1004: 5), (1005: 6), (1012: 1), (1013: 3), (1014: 2), (1018: 1), (1031: 1), (1032: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
