The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
469(1 to 12), 470(12 to 5), 473(7 to 3), 474(10 to 6), 475(11 to 1), 477(6 to 7), 497(3 to 4), 502(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(497: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(469: 5), (470: 2), (473: 1), (474: 3), (475: 5), (477: 9), (497: 2), (502: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
