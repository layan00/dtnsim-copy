The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
984(1 to 12), 985(12 to 5), 989(7 to 3), 990(10 to 6), 991(11 to 1), 995(6 to 7), 1015(3 to 4), 1019(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(989: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(984: 7), (985: 2), (989: 3), (990: 3), (991: 5), (995: 3), (1015: 1), (1019: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
