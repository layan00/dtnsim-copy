The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1773(1 to 12), 1774(12 to 5), 1790(7 to 3), 1791(10 to 6), 1792(11 to 1), 1793(6 to 7), 1824(3 to 4), 1827(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1774: 40.000000), (1791: 65.000000), (1827: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1773: 4), (1774: 3), (1790: 1), (1791: 6), (1792: 5), (1793: 1), (1824: 1), (1827: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
