The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
576(1 to 12), 577(12 to 5), 593(7 to 3), 594(10 to 6), 595(11 to 1), 598(6 to 7), 624(3 to 4), 630(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(576: 4), (577: 1), (593: 3), (594: 5), (595: 5), (598: 1), (624: 1), (630: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 45 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
