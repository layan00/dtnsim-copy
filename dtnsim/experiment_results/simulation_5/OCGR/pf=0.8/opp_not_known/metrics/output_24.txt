The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1765(1 to 12), 1766(12 to 5), 1780(7 to 3), 1781(10 to 6), 1782(11 to 1), 1784(6 to 7), 1811(3 to 4), 1814(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1765: 5), (1766: 1), (1780: 1), (1781: 3), (1782: 5), (1784: 1), (1811: 1), (1814: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
