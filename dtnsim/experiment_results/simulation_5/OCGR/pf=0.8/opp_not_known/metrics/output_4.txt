The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1761(1 to 12), 1762(12 to 5), 1777(7 to 3), 1778(10 to 6), 1779(11 to 1), 1781(6 to 7), 1810(3 to 4), 1813(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1813: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1761: 4), (1762: 1), (1777: 1), (1778: 3), (1779: 5), (1781: 1), (1810: 1), (1813: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
