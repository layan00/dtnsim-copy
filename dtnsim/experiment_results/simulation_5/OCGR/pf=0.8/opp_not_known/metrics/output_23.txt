The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1378(1 to 12), 1379(12 to 5), 1398(7 to 3), 1399(10 to 6), 1400(11 to 1), 1404(6 to 7), 1429(3 to 4), 1430(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1378: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1378: 4), (1379: 6), (1398: 1), (1399: 3), (1400: 3), (1404: 1), (1429: 1), (1430: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
