The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1367(1 to 12), 1368(12 to 5), 1388(7 to 3), 1389(10 to 6), 1390(11 to 1), 1397(6 to 7), 1429(3 to 4), 1430(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1368: 30.000000), (1389: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1367: 4), (1368: 4), (1388: 1), (1389: 4), (1390: 3), (1397: 1), (1429: 1), (1430: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
