The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1361(1 to 12), 1362(12 to 5), 1378(7 to 3), 1379(10 to 6), 1380(11 to 1), 1384(6 to 7), 1413(3 to 4), 1417(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1378: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1361: 4), (1362: 1), (1378: 3), (1379: 3), (1380: 5), (1384: 3), (1413: 1), (1417: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
