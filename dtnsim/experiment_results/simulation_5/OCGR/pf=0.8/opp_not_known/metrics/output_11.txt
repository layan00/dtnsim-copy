The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
594(1 to 12), 595(12 to 5), 611(7 to 3), 612(10 to 6), 613(11 to 1), 615(6 to 7), 649(3 to 4), 652(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(594: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(594: 4), (595: 1), (611: 1), (612: 4), (613: 5), (615: 5), (649: 1), (652: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
