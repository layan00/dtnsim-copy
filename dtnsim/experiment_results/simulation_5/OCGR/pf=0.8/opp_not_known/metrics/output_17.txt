The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
977(1 to 12), 978(12 to 5), 994(7 to 3), 995(10 to 6), 996(11 to 1), 997(6 to 7), 1024(3 to 4), 1028(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(977: 80.000000), (1024: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(977: 4), (978: 1), (994: 1), (995: 3), (996: 5), (997: 1), (1024: 2), (1028: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
