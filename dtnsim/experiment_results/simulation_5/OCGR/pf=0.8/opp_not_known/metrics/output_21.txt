The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
604(1 to 12), 605(12 to 5), 622(7 to 3), 623(10 to 6), 624(11 to 1), 628(6 to 7), 654(3 to 4), 655(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(604: 4), (605: 1), (622: 1), (623: 3), (624: 4), (628: 1), (654: 1), (655: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
