The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1380(1 to 12), 1381(12 to 5), 1396(7 to 3), 1397(10 to 6), 1398(11 to 1), 1401(6 to 7), 1432(3 to 4), 1435(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1380: 4), (1381: 1), (1396: 1), (1397: 4), (1398: 5), (1401: 5), (1432: 1), (1435: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 44 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
