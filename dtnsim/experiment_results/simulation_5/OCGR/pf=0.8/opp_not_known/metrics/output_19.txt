The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1746(1 to 12), 1747(12 to 5), 1763(7 to 3), 1764(10 to 6), 1765(11 to 1), 1767(6 to 7), 1793(3 to 4), 1796(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1746: 4), (1747: 1), (1763: 1), (1764: 4), (1765: 5), (1767: 1), (1793: 1), (1796: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
