The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
987(1 to 12), 988(12 to 5), 1004(7 to 3), 1005(10 to 6), 1006(11 to 1), 1008(6 to 7), 1041(3 to 4), 1045(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(987: 80.000000), (1006: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(987: 4), (988: 1), (1004: 1), (1005: 3), (1006: 5), (1008: 5), (1041: 1), (1045: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
