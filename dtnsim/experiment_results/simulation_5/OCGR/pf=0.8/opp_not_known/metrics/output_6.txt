The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
605(1 to 12), 606(12 to 5), 621(7 to 3), 622(10 to 6), 623(11 to 1), 628(6 to 7), 658(3 to 4), 659(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(659: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(605: 3), (606: 1), (621: 1), (622: 3), (623: 3), (628: 5), (658: 1), (659: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
