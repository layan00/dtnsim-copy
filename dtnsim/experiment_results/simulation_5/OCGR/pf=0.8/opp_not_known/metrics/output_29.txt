The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1766(1 to 12), 1767(12 to 5), 1782(7 to 3), 1783(10 to 6), 1784(11 to 1), 1789(6 to 7), 1820(3 to 4), 1823(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1823: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1766: 4), (1767: 1), (1782: 1), (1783: 4), (1784: 5), (1789: 5), (1820: 1), (1823: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
