The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(1 to 12), 202(12 to 5), 216(7 to 3), 217(10 to 6), 218(11 to 1), 220(6 to 7), 245(3 to 4), 248(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 3), (202: 1), (216: 1), (217: 3), (218: 5), (220: 1), (245: 1), (248: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
