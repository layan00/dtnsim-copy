The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
966(1 to 12), 967(12 to 5), 986(7 to 3), 987(10 to 6), 988(11 to 1), 991(6 to 7), 1023(3 to 4), 1029(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(967: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(966: 4), (967: 6), (986: 1), (987: 5), (988: 5), (991: 1), (1023: 2), (1029: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
