The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1381(1 to 12), 1382(12 to 5), 1400(7 to 3), 1401(10 to 6), 1402(11 to 1), 1403(6 to 7), 1434(3 to 4), 1441(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1400: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1381: 4), (1382: 6), (1400: 3), (1401: 5), (1402: 5), (1403: 1), (1434: 2), (1441: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
