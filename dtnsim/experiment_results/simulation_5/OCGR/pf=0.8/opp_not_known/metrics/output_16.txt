The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
599(1 to 12), 600(12 to 5), 615(7 to 3), 616(10 to 6), 617(11 to 1), 618(6 to 7), 645(3 to 4), 648(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(599: 4), (600: 1), (615: 1), (616: 3), (617: 5), (618: 1), (645: 1), (648: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
