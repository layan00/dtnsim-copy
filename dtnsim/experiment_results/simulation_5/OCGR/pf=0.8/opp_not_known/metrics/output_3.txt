The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1372(1 to 12), 1373(12 to 5), 1388(7 to 3), 1389(10 to 6), 1390(11 to 1), 1391(6 to 7), 1421(3 to 4), 1427(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1372: 4), (1373: 1), (1388: 3), (1389: 4), (1390: 5), (1391: 1), (1421: 2), (1427: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
