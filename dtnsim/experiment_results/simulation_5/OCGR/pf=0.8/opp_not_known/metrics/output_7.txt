The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
992(1 to 12), 993(12 to 5), 1009(7 to 3), 1010(10 to 6), 1011(11 to 1), 1015(6 to 7), 1045(3 to 4), 1049(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(992: 4), (993: 1), (1009: 3), (1010: 4), (1011: 5), (1015: 1), (1045: 1), (1049: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
