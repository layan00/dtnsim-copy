The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
995(1 to 12), 996(12 to 5), 1011(7 to 3), 1012(10 to 6), 1013(11 to 1), 1015(6 to 7), 1041(3 to 4), 1045(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(995: 4), (996: 1), (1011: 1), (1012: 3), (1013: 5), (1015: 1), (1041: 2), (1045: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
