The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
380(1 to 12), 381(12 to 5), 383(7 to 3), 384(10 to 6), 385(11 to 1), 387(6 to 7), 389(3 to 4), 390(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(380: 2), (381: 1), (383: 1), (384: 4), (385: 2), (387: 1), (389: 1), (390: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 380: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
