The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
150(1 to 12), 151(12 to 5), 152(7 to 3), 153(10 to 6), 154(11 to 1), 155(6 to 7), 158(3 to 4), 159(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(150: 2), (151: 1), (152: 1), (153: 3), (154: 2), (155: 1), (158: 1), (159: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 150: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
