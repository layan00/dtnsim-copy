The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
392(1 to 12), 393(12 to 5), 395(7 to 3), 396(10 to 6), 397(11 to 1), 398(6 to 7), 403(3 to 4), 404(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(396: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(392: 4), (393: 2), (395: 1), (396: 6), (397: 2), (398: 1), (403: 1), (404: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 392: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
