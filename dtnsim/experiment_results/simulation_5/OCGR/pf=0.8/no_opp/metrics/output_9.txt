The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
396(1 to 12), 397(12 to 5), 398(7 to 3), 399(10 to 6), 400(11 to 1), 402(6 to 7), 406(3 to 4), 407(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(407: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(396: 2), (397: 1), (398: 1), (399: 5), (400: 2), (402: 1), (406: 1), (407: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
