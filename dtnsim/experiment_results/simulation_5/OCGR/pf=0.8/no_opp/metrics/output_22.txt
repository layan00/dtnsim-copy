The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
231(1 to 12), 232(12 to 5), 234(7 to 3), 235(10 to 6), 236(11 to 1), 238(6 to 7), 245(3 to 4), 246(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(231: 2), (232: 1), (234: 1), (235: 3), (236: 2), (238: 2), (245: 1), (246: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 231: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
