The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 12), 213(12 to 5), 215(7 to 3), 216(10 to 6), 217(11 to 1), 220(6 to 7), 228(3 to 4), 230(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 2), (213: 1), (215: 1), (216: 5), (217: 2), (220: 1), (228: 2), (230: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 212: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
