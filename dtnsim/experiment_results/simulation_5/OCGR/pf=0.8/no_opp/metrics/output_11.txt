The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
141(1 to 12), 142(12 to 5), 144(7 to 3), 145(10 to 6), 146(11 to 1), 148(6 to 7), 156(3 to 4), 157(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(141: 2), (142: 1), (144: 1), (145: 4), (146: 2), (148: 2), (156: 1), (157: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
