The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
236(1 to 12), 237(12 to 5), 238(7 to 3), 239(10 to 6), 240(11 to 1), 242(6 to 7), 244(3 to 4), 246(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 2), (237: 1), (238: 1), (239: 3), (240: 2), (242: 1), (244: 2), (246: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 236: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
