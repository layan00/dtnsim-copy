The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
302(1 to 12), 303(12 to 5), 306(7 to 3), 307(10 to 6), 308(11 to 1), 314(6 to 7), 325(3 to 4), 326(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(303: 40.000000), (307: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(302: 2), (303: 3), (306: 1), (307: 4), (308: 3), (314: 1), (325: 1), (326: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
