The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
390(1 to 12), 391(12 to 5), 394(7 to 3), 395(10 to 6), 396(11 to 1), 398(6 to 7), 403(3 to 4), 404(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(390: 4), (391: 1), (394: 1), (395: 3), (396: 2), (398: 1), (403: 1), (404: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 390: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
