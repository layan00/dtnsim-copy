The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(1 to 12), 228(12 to 5), 230(7 to 3), 231(10 to 6), 232(11 to 1), 233(6 to 7), 237(3 to 4), 239(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 2), (228: 1), (230: 1), (231: 4), (232: 2), (233: 1), (237: 2), (239: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
