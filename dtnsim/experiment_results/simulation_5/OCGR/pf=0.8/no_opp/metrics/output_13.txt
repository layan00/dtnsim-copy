The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
310(1 to 12), 311(12 to 5), 312(7 to 3), 313(10 to 6), 314(11 to 1), 315(6 to 7), 322(3 to 4), 326(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(312: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(310: 2), (311: 1), (312: 3), (313: 5), (314: 2), (315: 1), (322: 2), (326: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 310: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
