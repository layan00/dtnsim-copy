The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
60(1 to 12), 61(12 to 5), 62(7 to 3), 63(10 to 6), 64(11 to 1), 67(6 to 7), 70(3 to 4), 71(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(60: 2), (61: 1), (62: 1), (63: 4), (64: 4), (67: 1), (70: 1), (71: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 60: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
