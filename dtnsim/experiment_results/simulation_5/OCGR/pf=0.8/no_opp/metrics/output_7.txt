The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
230(1 to 12), 231(12 to 5), 233(7 to 3), 234(10 to 6), 235(11 to 1), 239(6 to 7), 245(3 to 4), 249(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(230: 2), (231: 1), (233: 3), (234: 4), (235: 5), (239: 1), (245: 1), (249: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
