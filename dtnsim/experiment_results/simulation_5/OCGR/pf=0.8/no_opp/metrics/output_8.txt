The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
315(1 to 12), 316(12 to 5), 319(7 to 3), 320(10 to 6), 321(11 to 1), 324(6 to 7), 329(3 to 4), 330(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(315: 4), (316: 1), (319: 1), (320: 4), (321: 2), (324: 2), (329: 1), (330: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 315: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
