The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
147(1 to 12), 148(12 to 5), 151(7 to 3), 152(10 to 6), 153(11 to 1), 158(6 to 7), 162(3 to 4), 163(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(147: 3), (148: 1), (151: 1), (152: 3), (153: 3), (158: 2), (162: 1), (163: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 147: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
