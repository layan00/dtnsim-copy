The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(1 to 12), 67(12 to 5), 70(7 to 3), 71(10 to 6), 72(11 to 1), 74(6 to 7), 83(3 to 4), 85(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(72: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 5), (67: 1), (70: 1), (71: 3), (72: 4), (74: 2), (83: 1), (85: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 66: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2:
