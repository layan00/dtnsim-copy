The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 12), 221(12 to 5), 228(7 to 3), 229(10 to 6), 230(11 to 1), 239(6 to 7), 273(3 to 4), 276(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 80.000000), (221: 30.000000), (229: 15.000000), (239: 5.000000), (273: 10.000000), (276: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 5), (221: 4), (228: 3), (229: 4), (230: 2), (239: 5), (273: 2), (276: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
