The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 12), 225(12 to 5), 235(7 to 3), 236(10 to 6), 237(11 to 1), 249(6 to 7), 284(3 to 4), 287(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 30.000000), (225: 30.000000), (236: 45.000000), (237: 15.000000), (249: 5.000000), (284: 10.000000), (287: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 5), (225: 4), (235: 1), (236: 6), (237: 4), (249: 5), (284: 2), (287: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
