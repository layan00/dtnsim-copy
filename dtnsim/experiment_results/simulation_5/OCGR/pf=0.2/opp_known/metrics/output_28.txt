The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1227(1 to 12), 1228(12 to 5), 1235(7 to 3), 1236(10 to 6), 1237(11 to 1), 1248(6 to 7), 1280(3 to 4), 1283(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1227: 80.000000), (1228: 30.000000), (1236: 15.000000), (1248: 5.000000), (1280: 10.000000), (1283: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1227: 5), (1228: 4), (1235: 3), (1236: 4), (1237: 2), (1248: 5), (1280: 2), (1283: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
