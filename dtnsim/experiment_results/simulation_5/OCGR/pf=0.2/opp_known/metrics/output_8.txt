The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1252(1 to 12), 1253(12 to 5), 1264(7 to 3), 1265(10 to 6), 1266(11 to 1), 1280(6 to 7), 1313(3 to 4), 1319(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1252: 30.000000), (1253: 30.000000), (1264: 25.000000), (1265: 45.000000), (1266: 5.000000), (1280: 5.000000), (1313: 10.000000), (1319: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1252: 5), (1253: 4), (1264: 3), (1265: 5), (1266: 4), (1280: 5), (1313: 2), (1319: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
