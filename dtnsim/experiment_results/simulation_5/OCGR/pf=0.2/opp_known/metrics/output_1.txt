The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
568(1 to 12), 569(12 to 5), 578(7 to 3), 579(10 to 6), 580(11 to 1), 590(6 to 7), 619(3 to 4), 623(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(568: 80.000000), (569: 30.000000), (580: 55.000000), (590: 5.000000), (619: 10.000000), (623: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(568: 5), (569: 4), (578: 1), (579: 5), (580: 8), (590: 5), (619: 2), (623: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
