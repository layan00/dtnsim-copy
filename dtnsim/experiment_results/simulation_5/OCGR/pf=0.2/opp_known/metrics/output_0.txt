The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(1 to 12), 226(12 to 5), 236(7 to 3), 237(10 to 6), 238(11 to 1), 250(6 to 7), 281(3 to 4), 292(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 30.000000), (226: 30.000000), (236: 25.000000), (237: 45.000000), (238: 25.000000), (250: 5.000000), (281: 10.000000), (292: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 5), (226: 4), (236: 3), (237: 6), (238: 5), (250: 5), (281: 2), (292: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
