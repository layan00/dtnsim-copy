The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1221(1 to 12), 1222(12 to 5), 1231(7 to 3), 1232(10 to 6), 1233(11 to 1), 1246(6 to 7), 1274(3 to 4), 1276(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1221: 30.000000), (1222: 30.000000), (1231: 45.000000), (1232: 15.000000), (1276: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1221: 5), (1222: 4), (1231: 3), (1232: 4), (1233: 2), (1246: 3), (1274: 1), (1276: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
