The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
565(1 to 12), 566(12 to 5), 575(7 to 3), 576(10 to 6), 577(11 to 1), 591(6 to 7), 623(3 to 4), 625(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(566: 30.000000), (576: 15.000000), (577: 5.000000), (591: 5.000000), (623: 10.000000), (625: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(565: 4), (566: 4), (575: 1), (576: 4), (577: 4), (591: 5), (623: 2), (625: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
