The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
890(1 to 12), 891(12 to 5), 902(7 to 3), 903(10 to 6), 904(11 to 1), 914(6 to 7), 941(3 to 4), 950(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(890: 30.000000), (891: 30.000000), (902: 25.000000), (903: 45.000000), (904: 25.000000), (941: 10.000000), (950: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(890: 5), (891: 4), (902: 3), (903: 5), (904: 6), (914: 3), (941: 2), (950: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
