The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
905(1 to 12), 906(12 to 5), 917(7 to 3), 918(10 to 6), 919(11 to 1), 931(6 to 7), 960(3 to 4), 967(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(905: 30.000000), (906: 30.000000), (917: 45.000000), (918: 45.000000), (919: 55.000000), (931: 5.000000), (960: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(905: 5), (906: 4), (917: 3), (918: 6), (919: 9), (931: 5), (960: 2), (967: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
