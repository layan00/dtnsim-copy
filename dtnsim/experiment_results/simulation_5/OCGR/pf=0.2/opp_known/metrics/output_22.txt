The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
890(1 to 12), 891(12 to 5), 897(7 to 3), 898(10 to 6), 899(11 to 1), 910(6 to 7), 935(3 to 4), 943(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(890: 30.000000), (898: 45.000000), (899: 25.000000), (935: 10.000000), (943: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(890: 5), (891: 2), (897: 1), (898: 6), (899: 5), (910: 3), (935: 2), (943: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
