The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
236(1 to 12), 237(12 to 5), 259(7 to 3), 260(10 to 6), 261(11 to 1), 275(6 to 7), 317(3 to 4), 323(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(236: 30.000000), (237: 30.000000), (259: 25.000000), (260: 45.000000), (261: 5.000000), (275: 5.000000), (317: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(236: 5), (237: 4), (259: 3), (260: 5), (261: 4), (275: 5), (317: 2), (323: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
