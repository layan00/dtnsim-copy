The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
691(1 to 12), 692(12 to 5), 710(7 to 3), 711(10 to 6), 712(11 to 1), 724(6 to 7), 766(3 to 4), 769(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(692: 40.000000), (710: 45.000000), (711: 15.000000), (712: 5.000000), (766: 10.000000), (769: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(691: 4), (692: 3), (710: 3), (711: 4), (712: 4), (724: 1), (766: 2), (769: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
