The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
232(1 to 12), 233(12 to 5), 252(7 to 3), 253(10 to 6), 254(11 to 1), 263(6 to 7), 310(3 to 4), 314(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(232: 80.000000), (233: 30.000000), (253: 15.000000), (263: 5.000000), (310: 10.000000), (314: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(232: 5), (233: 4), (252: 3), (253: 4), (254: 5), (263: 5), (310: 2), (314: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
