The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
698(1 to 12), 699(12 to 5), 720(7 to 3), 721(10 to 6), 722(11 to 1), 736(6 to 7), 780(3 to 4), 782(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(699: 30.000000), (721: 15.000000), (722: 5.000000), (736: 5.000000), (780: 10.000000), (782: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(698: 4), (699: 4), (720: 1), (721: 4), (722: 4), (736: 5), (780: 2), (782: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
