The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1139(1 to 12), 1140(12 to 5), 1158(7 to 3), 1159(10 to 6), 1160(11 to 1), 1171(6 to 7), 1208(3 to 4), 1216(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1139: 30.000000), (1159: 45.000000), (1160: 25.000000), (1208: 10.000000), (1216: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1139: 5), (1140: 1), (1158: 1), (1159: 6), (1160: 5), (1171: 3), (1208: 2), (1216: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
