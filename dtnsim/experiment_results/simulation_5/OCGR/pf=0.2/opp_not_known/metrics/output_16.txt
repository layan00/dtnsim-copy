The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
685(1 to 12), 686(12 to 5), 707(7 to 3), 708(10 to 6), 709(11 to 1), 720(6 to 7), 760(3 to 4), 765(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(685: 80.000000), (686: 70.000000), (707: 45.000000), (708: 15.000000), (709: 5.000000), (765: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(685: 7), (686: 7), (707: 3), (708: 4), (709: 4), (720: 5), (760: 1), (765: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
