The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
688(1 to 12), 689(12 to 5), 711(7 to 3), 712(10 to 6), 713(11 to 1), 729(6 to 7), 768(3 to 4), 774(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(688: 30.000000), (689: 30.000000), (711: 25.000000), (712: 45.000000), (713: 5.000000), (774: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(688: 5), (689: 4), (711: 3), (712: 6), (713: 4), (729: 3), (768: 2), (774: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
