The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
384(1 to 12), 385(12 to 5), 393(7 to 3), 394(10 to 6), 395(11 to 1), 404(6 to 7), 419(3 to 4), 428(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(384: 30.000000), (393: 25.000000), (394: 45.000000), (395: 25.000000), (419: 10.000000), (428: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(384: 5), (385: 1), (393: 3), (394: 5), (395: 6), (404: 3), (419: 2), (428: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
