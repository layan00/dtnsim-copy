The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
695(1 to 12), 696(12 to 5), 704(7 to 3), 705(10 to 6), 706(11 to 1), 717(6 to 7), 730(3 to 4), 732(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(704: 45.000000), (706: 5.000000), (732: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(695: 5), (696: 2), (704: 3), (705: 2), (706: 4), (717: 2), (730: 1), (732: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
