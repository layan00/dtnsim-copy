The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
93(1 to 12), 94(12 to 5), 101(7 to 3), 102(10 to 6), 103(11 to 1), 114(6 to 7), 134(3 to 4), 139(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(93: 30.000000), (101: 25.000000), (114: 5.000000), (134: 10.000000), (139: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(93: 5), (94: 2), (101: 3), (102: 2), (103: 2), (114: 5), (134: 2), (139: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
