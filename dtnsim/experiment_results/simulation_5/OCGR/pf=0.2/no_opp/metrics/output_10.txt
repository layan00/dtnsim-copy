The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
88(1 to 12), 89(12 to 5), 95(7 to 3), 96(10 to 6), 97(11 to 1), 105(6 to 7), 119(3 to 4), 124(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(89: 40.000000), (95: 45.000000), (96: 45.000000), (119: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(88: 7), (89: 3), (95: 3), (96: 5), (97: 4), (105: 1), (119: 2), (124: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
