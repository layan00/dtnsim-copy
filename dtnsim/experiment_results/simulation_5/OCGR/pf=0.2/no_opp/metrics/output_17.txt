The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
386(1 to 12), 387(12 to 5), 393(7 to 3), 394(10 to 6), 395(11 to 1), 406(6 to 7), 417(3 to 4), 421(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(395: 5.000000), (417: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(386: 5), (387: 1), (393: 3), (394: 2), (395: 4), (406: 1), (417: 2), (421: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
