The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
246(1 to 12), 247(12 to 5), 251(7 to 3), 252(10 to 6), 253(11 to 1), 265(6 to 7), 283(3 to 4), 286(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(247: 40.000000), (251: 45.000000), (252: 15.000000), (253: 5.000000), (283: 10.000000), (286: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(246: 4), (247: 3), (251: 3), (252: 4), (253: 4), (265: 1), (283: 2), (286: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
