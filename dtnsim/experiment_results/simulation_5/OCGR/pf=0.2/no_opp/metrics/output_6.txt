The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
252(1 to 12), 253(12 to 5), 259(7 to 3), 260(10 to 6), 261(11 to 1), 274(6 to 7), 297(3 to 4), 299(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(253: 40.000000), (260: 15.000000), (261: 5.000000), (274: 5.000000), (297: 10.000000), (299: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(252: 4), (253: 3), (259: 1), (260: 4), (261: 4), (274: 5), (297: 2), (299: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
