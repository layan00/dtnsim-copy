The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
538(1 to 12), 539(12 to 5), 545(7 to 3), 546(10 to 6), 547(11 to 1), 559(6 to 7), 576(3 to 4), 579(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(538: 30.000000), (545: 45.000000), (546: 15.000000), (579: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(538: 5), (539: 1), (545: 3), (546: 4), (547: 5), (559: 3), (576: 1), (579: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
