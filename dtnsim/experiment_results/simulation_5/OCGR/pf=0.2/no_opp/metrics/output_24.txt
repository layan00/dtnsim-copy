The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
694(1 to 12), 695(12 to 5), 701(7 to 3), 702(10 to 6), 703(11 to 1), 716(6 to 7), 741(3 to 4), 746(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(694: 80.000000), (695: 40.000000), (701: 25.000000), (702: 15.000000), (703: 5.000000), (716: 5.000000), (746: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(694: 7), (695: 3), (701: 3), (702: 4), (703: 4), (716: 5), (741: 1), (746: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
