The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
362(1 to 12), 363(12 to 5), 368(7 to 3), 369(10 to 6), 370(11 to 1), 377(6 to 7), 391(3 to 4), 393(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(362: 80.000000), (369: 65.000000), (391: 10.000000), (393: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(362: 4), (363: 2), (368: 1), (369: 6), (370: 4), (377: 4), (391: 2), (393: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
