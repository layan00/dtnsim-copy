The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
87(1 to 12), 88(12 to 5), 94(7 to 3), 95(10 to 6), 96(11 to 1), 108(6 to 7), 122(3 to 4), 127(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(94: 25.000000), (96: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(87: 3), (88: 2), (94: 3), (95: 2), (96: 4), (108: 2), (122: 2), (127: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
