The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
691(1 to 12), 692(12 to 5), 700(7 to 3), 701(10 to 6), 702(11 to 1), 715(6 to 7), 736(3 to 4), 742(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(691: 30.000000), (692: 40.000000), (700: 25.000000), (702: 5.000000), (736: 10.000000), (742: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(691: 5), (692: 3), (700: 3), (701: 4), (702: 4), (715: 4), (736: 2), (742: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
