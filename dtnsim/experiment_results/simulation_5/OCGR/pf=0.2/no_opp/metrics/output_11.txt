The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
229(1 to 12), 230(12 to 5), 234(7 to 3), 235(10 to 6), 236(11 to 1), 243(6 to 7), 258(3 to 4), 264(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(258: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(229: 2), (230: 2), (234: 3), (235: 2), (236: 6), (243: 2), (258: 2), (264: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
