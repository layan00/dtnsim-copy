The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
240(1 to 12), 241(12 to 5), 247(7 to 3), 248(10 to 6), 249(11 to 1), 260(6 to 7), 277(3 to 4), 280(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(241: 40.000000), (247: 45.000000), (248: 15.000000), (249: 5.000000), (280: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(240: 6), (241: 3), (247: 3), (248: 4), (249: 4), (260: 2), (277: 1), (280: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
