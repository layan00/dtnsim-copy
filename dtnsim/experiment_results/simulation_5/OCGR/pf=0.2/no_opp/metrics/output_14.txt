The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
675(1 to 12), 676(12 to 5), 684(7 to 3), 685(10 to 6), 686(11 to 1), 701(6 to 7), 720(3 to 4), 725(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(675: 30.000000), (684: 25.000000), (685: 65.000000), (686: 5.000000), (701: 5.000000), (725: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(675: 5), (676: 4), (684: 3), (685: 5), (686: 4), (701: 5), (720: 2), (725: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
