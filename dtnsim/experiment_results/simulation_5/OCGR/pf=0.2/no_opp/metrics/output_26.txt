The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
232(1 to 12), 233(12 to 5), 240(7 to 3), 241(10 to 6), 242(11 to 1), 257(6 to 7), 272(3 to 4), 278(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(232: 30.000000), (240: 25.000000), (241: 45.000000), (242: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(232: 5), (233: 1), (240: 3), (241: 6), (242: 4), (257: 3), (272: 2), (278: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
