The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
678(1 to 12), 679(12 to 5), 684(7 to 3), 685(10 to 6), 686(11 to 1), 699(6 to 7), 712(3 to 4), 715(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(678: 80.000000), (684: 45.000000), (686: 5.000000), (712: 10.000000), (715: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(678: 4), (679: 1), (684: 3), (685: 2), (686: 4), (699: 3), (712: 2), (715: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
