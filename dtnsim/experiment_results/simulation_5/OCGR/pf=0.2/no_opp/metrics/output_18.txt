The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
528(1 to 12), 529(12 to 5), 537(7 to 3), 538(10 to 6), 539(11 to 1), 553(6 to 7), 569(3 to 4), 572(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(528: 30.000000), (537: 45.000000), (539: 5.000000), (553: 5.000000), (569: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(528: 5), (529: 2), (537: 3), (538: 2), (539: 4), (553: 5), (569: 2), (572: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
