The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
540(1 to 12), 541(12 to 5), 545(7 to 3), 546(10 to 6), 547(11 to 1), 560(6 to 7), 584(3 to 4), 587(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(540: 80.000000), (541: 40.000000), (545: 45.000000), (546: 15.000000), (547: 5.000000), (560: 5.000000), (584: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(540: 5), (541: 3), (545: 3), (546: 4), (547: 4), (560: 5), (584: 2), (587: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
