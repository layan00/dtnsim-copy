The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
515(1 to 12), 516(12 to 5), 519(7 to 3), 520(10 to 6), 521(11 to 1), 532(6 to 7), 544(3 to 4), 545(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(516: 40.000000), (521: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(515: 2), (516: 3), (519: 1), (520: 5), (521: 4), (532: 1), (544: 1), (545: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
