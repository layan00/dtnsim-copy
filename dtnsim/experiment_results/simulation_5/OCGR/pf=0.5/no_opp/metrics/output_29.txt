The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
520(1 to 12), 521(12 to 5), 527(7 to 3), 528(10 to 6), 529(11 to 1), 537(6 to 7), 548(3 to 4), 550(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(520: 30.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(520: 5), (521: 1), (527: 1), (528: 5), (529: 5), (537: 3), (548: 1), (550: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
