The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
303(1 to 12), 304(12 to 5), 307(7 to 3), 308(10 to 6), 309(11 to 1), 314(6 to 7), 323(3 to 4), 325(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(323: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(303: 2), (304: 1), (307: 1), (308: 4), (309: 4), (314: 1), (323: 2), (325: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 303: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
