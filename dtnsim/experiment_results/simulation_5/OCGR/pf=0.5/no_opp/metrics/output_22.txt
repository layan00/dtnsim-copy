The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
314(1 to 12), 315(12 to 5), 317(7 to 3), 318(10 to 6), 319(11 to 1), 324(6 to 7), 335(3 to 4), 337(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(314: 80.000000), (335: 10.000000), (337: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(314: 4), (315: 1), (317: 1), (318: 3), (319: 2), (324: 3), (335: 2), (337: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
