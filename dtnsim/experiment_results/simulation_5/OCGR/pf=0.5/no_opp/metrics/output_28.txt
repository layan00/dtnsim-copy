The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
399(1 to 12), 400(12 to 5), 404(7 to 3), 405(10 to 6), 406(11 to 1), 415(6 to 7), 432(3 to 4), 435(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(400: 40.000000), (405: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(399: 3), (400: 3), (404: 3), (405: 4), (406: 5), (415: 4), (432: 1), (435: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
