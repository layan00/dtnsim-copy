The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
429(1 to 12), 430(12 to 5), 436(7 to 3), 437(10 to 6), 438(11 to 1), 442(6 to 7), 449(3 to 4), 450(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(429: 4), (430: 1), (436: 1), (437: 4), (438: 4), (442: 1), (449: 1), (450: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
