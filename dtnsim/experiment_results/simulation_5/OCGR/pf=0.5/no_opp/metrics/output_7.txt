The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
303(1 to 12), 304(12 to 5), 307(7 to 3), 308(10 to 6), 309(11 to 1), 317(6 to 7), 327(3 to 4), 330(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(303: 2), (304: 1), (307: 3), (308: 2), (309: 5), (317: 3), (327: 1), (330: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
