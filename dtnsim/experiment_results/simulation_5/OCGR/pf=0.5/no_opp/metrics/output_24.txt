The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
541(1 to 12), 542(12 to 5), 545(7 to 3), 546(10 to 6), 547(11 to 1), 554(6 to 7), 564(3 to 4), 565(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(541: 80.000000), (546: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(541: 5), (542: 1), (545: 1), (546: 5), (547: 4), (554: 2), (564: 1), (565: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
