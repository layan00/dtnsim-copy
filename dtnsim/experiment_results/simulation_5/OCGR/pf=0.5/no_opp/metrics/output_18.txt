The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
405(1 to 12), 406(12 to 5), 410(7 to 3), 411(10 to 6), 412(11 to 1), 420(6 to 7), 430(3 to 4), 432(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(405: 80.000000), (410: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(405: 5), (406: 2), (410: 3), (411: 2), (412: 2), (420: 4), (430: 1), (432: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
