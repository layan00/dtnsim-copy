The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
307(1 to 12), 308(12 to 5), 311(7 to 3), 312(10 to 6), 313(11 to 1), 321(6 to 7), 326(3 to 4), 328(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(307: 2), (308: 1), (311: 1), (312: 2), (313: 3), (321: 3), (326: 2), (328: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
