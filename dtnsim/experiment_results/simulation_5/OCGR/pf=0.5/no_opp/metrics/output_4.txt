The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
524(1 to 12), 525(12 to 5), 530(7 to 3), 531(10 to 6), 532(11 to 1), 537(6 to 7), 546(3 to 4), 549(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(530: 45.000000), (549: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(524: 6), (525: 1), (530: 3), (531: 4), (532: 3), (537: 2), (546: 1), (549: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
