The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
288(1 to 12), 289(12 to 5), 293(7 to 3), 294(10 to 6), 295(11 to 1), 299(6 to 7), 310(3 to 4), 312(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(288: 2), (289: 1), (293: 1), (294: 5), (295: 2), (299: 3), (310: 2), (312: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
