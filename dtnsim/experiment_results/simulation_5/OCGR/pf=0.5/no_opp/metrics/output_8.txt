The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
411(1 to 12), 412(12 to 5), 417(7 to 3), 418(10 to 6), 419(11 to 1), 423(6 to 7), 434(3 to 4), 436(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(411: 4), (412: 1), (417: 1), (418: 4), (419: 5), (423: 3), (434: 1), (436: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
