The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
191(1 to 12), 192(12 to 5), 194(7 to 3), 195(10 to 6), 196(11 to 1), 199(6 to 7), 208(3 to 4), 209(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 2), (192: 2), (194: 1), (195: 3), (196: 2), (199: 2), (208: 1), (209: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
