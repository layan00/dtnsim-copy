The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
407(1 to 12), 408(12 to 5), 412(7 to 3), 413(10 to 6), 414(11 to 1), 419(6 to 7), 429(3 to 4), 434(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(429: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(407: 4), (408: 1), (412: 3), (413: 4), (414: 5), (419: 2), (429: 2), (434: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
