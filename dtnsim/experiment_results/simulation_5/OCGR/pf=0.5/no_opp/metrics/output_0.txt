The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 12), 81(12 to 5), 88(7 to 3), 89(10 to 6), 90(11 to 1), 96(6 to 7), 105(3 to 4), 107(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(105: 10.000000), (107: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 4), (81: 1), (88: 1), (89: 6), (90: 2), (96: 1), (105: 2), (107: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 80: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
