The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
179(1 to 12), 180(12 to 5), 183(7 to 3), 184(10 to 6), 185(11 to 1), 191(6 to 7), 197(3 to 4), 199(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(183: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(179: 4), (180: 1), (183: 3), (184: 2), (185: 2), (191: 1), (197: 1), (199: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 179: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
