The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
73(1 to 12), 74(12 to 5), 75(7 to 3), 76(10 to 6), 77(11 to 1), 84(6 to 7), 96(3 to 4), 98(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(96: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(73: 2), (74: 1), (75: 1), (76: 4), (77: 4), (84: 3), (96: 2), (98: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
