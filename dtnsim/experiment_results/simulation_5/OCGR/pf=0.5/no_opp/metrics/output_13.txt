The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
419(1 to 12), 420(12 to 5), 426(7 to 3), 427(10 to 6), 428(11 to 1), 431(6 to 7), 446(3 to 4), 455(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(426: 25.000000), (427: 45.000000), (428: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(419: 4), (420: 2), (426: 3), (427: 5), (428: 6), (431: 1), (446: 2), (455: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
