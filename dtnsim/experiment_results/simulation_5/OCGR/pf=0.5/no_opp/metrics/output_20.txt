The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
83(1 to 12), 84(12 to 5), 90(7 to 3), 91(10 to 6), 92(11 to 1), 99(6 to 7), 113(3 to 4), 117(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(83: 30.000000), (92: 25.000000), (113: 10.000000), (117: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(83: 5), (84: 1), (90: 1), (91: 4), (92: 5), (99: 3), (113: 2), (117: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
