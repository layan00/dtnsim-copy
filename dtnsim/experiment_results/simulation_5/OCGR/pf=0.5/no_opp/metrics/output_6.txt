The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
187(1 to 12), 188(12 to 5), 191(7 to 3), 192(10 to 6), 193(11 to 1), 201(6 to 7), 217(3 to 4), 218(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(192: 15.000000), (218: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(187: 3), (188: 1), (191: 1), (192: 4), (193: 4), (201: 3), (217: 1), (218: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
