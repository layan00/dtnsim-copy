The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
294(1 to 12), 295(12 to 5), 299(7 to 3), 300(10 to 6), 301(11 to 1), 306(6 to 7), 312(3 to 4), 316(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(312: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(294: 2), (295: 1), (299: 3), (300: 3), (301: 5), (306: 1), (312: 2), (316: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
