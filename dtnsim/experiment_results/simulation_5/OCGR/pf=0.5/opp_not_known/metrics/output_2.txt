The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1062(1 to 12), 1063(12 to 5), 1083(7 to 3), 1084(10 to 6), 1085(11 to 1), 1094(6 to 7), 1123(3 to 4), 1127(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1063: 30.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1062: 4), (1063: 4), (1083: 1), (1084: 5), (1085: 3), (1094: 3), (1123: 2), (1127: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
