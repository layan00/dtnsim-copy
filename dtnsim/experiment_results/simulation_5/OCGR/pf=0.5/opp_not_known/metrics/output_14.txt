The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1917(1 to 12), 1918(12 to 5), 1934(7 to 3), 1935(10 to 6), 1936(11 to 1), 1941(6 to 7), 1981(3 to 4), 1984(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1918: 40.000000), (1935: 65.000000), (1936: 15.000000), (1984: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1917: 3), (1918: 3), (1934: 1), (1935: 6), (1936: 4), (1941: 6), (1981: 2), (1984: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
