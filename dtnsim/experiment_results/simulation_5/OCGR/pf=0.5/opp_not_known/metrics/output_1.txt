The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
644(1 to 12), 645(12 to 5), 665(7 to 3), 666(10 to 6), 667(11 to 1), 675(6 to 7), 708(3 to 4), 713(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(708: 10.000000), (713: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(644: 4), (645: 6), (665: 1), (666: 5), (667: 4), (675: 3), (708: 2), (713: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
