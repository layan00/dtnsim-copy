The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(1 to 12), 228(12 to 5), 249(7 to 3), 250(10 to 6), 251(11 to 1), 259(6 to 7), 299(3 to 4), 301(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 30.000000), (228: 30.000000), (251: 15.000000), (299: 10.000000), (301: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 5), (228: 4), (249: 1), (250: 4), (251: 4), (259: 3), (299: 2), (301: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
