The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
633(1 to 12), 634(12 to 5), 651(7 to 3), 652(10 to 6), 653(11 to 1), 659(6 to 7), 689(3 to 4), 695(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(651: 45.000000), (695: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(633: 4), (634: 1), (651: 3), (652: 5), (653: 5), (659: 1), (689: 1), (695: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
