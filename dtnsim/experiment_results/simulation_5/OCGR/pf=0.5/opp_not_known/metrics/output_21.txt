The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
651(1 to 12), 652(12 to 5), 669(7 to 3), 670(10 to 6), 671(11 to 1), 677(6 to 7), 714(3 to 4), 716(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(652: 40.000000), (714: 10.000000), (716: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(651: 4), (652: 3), (669: 1), (670: 4), (671: 4), (677: 1), (714: 2), (716: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
