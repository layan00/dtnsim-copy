The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1055(1 to 12), 1056(12 to 5), 1073(7 to 3), 1074(10 to 6), 1075(11 to 1), 1083(6 to 7), 1117(3 to 4), 1123(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1055: 4), (1056: 1), (1073: 3), (1074: 6), (1075: 5), (1083: 3), (1117: 1), (1123: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 44 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
