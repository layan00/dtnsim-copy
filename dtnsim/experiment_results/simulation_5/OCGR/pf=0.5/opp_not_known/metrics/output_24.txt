The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1900(1 to 12), 1901(12 to 5), 1919(7 to 3), 1920(10 to 6), 1921(11 to 1), 1928(6 to 7), 1966(3 to 4), 1967(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1900: 80.000000), (1920: 65.000000), (1921: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1900: 5), (1901: 6), (1919: 1), (1920: 5), (1921: 4), (1928: 5), (1966: 1), (1967: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
