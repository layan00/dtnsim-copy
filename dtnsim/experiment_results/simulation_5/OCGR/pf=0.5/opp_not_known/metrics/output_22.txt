The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1065(1 to 12), 1066(12 to 5), 1082(7 to 3), 1083(10 to 6), 1084(11 to 1), 1089(6 to 7), 1124(3 to 4), 1129(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1065: 80.000000), (1084: 25.000000), (1124: 10.000000), (1129: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1065: 4), (1066: 1), (1082: 1), (1083: 3), (1084: 5), (1089: 3), (1124: 2), (1129: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
