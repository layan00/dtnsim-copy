The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
639(1 to 12), 640(12 to 5), 655(7 to 3), 656(10 to 6), 657(11 to 1), 665(6 to 7), 705(3 to 4), 706(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(656: 15.000000), (706: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(639: 3), (640: 1), (655: 1), (656: 4), (657: 4), (665: 3), (705: 1), (706: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
