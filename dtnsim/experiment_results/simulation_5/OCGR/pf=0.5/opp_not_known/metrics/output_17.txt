The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1058(1 to 12), 1059(12 to 5), 1080(7 to 3), 1081(10 to 6), 1082(11 to 1), 1088(6 to 7), 1118(3 to 4), 1122(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1058: 80.000000), (1059: 30.000000), (1118: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1058: 4), (1059: 4), (1080: 3), (1081: 3), (1082: 5), (1088: 1), (1118: 2), (1122: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
