The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1472(1 to 12), 1473(12 to 5), 1489(7 to 3), 1490(10 to 6), 1491(11 to 1), 1496(6 to 7), 1532(3 to 4), 1538(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1532: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1472: 4), (1473: 1), (1489: 3), (1490: 4), (1491: 5), (1496: 8), (1532: 2), (1538: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
