The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1880(1 to 12), 1881(12 to 5), 1898(7 to 3), 1899(10 to 6), 1900(11 to 1), 1911(6 to 7), 1947(3 to 4), 1948(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1880: 80.000000), (1881: 40.000000), (1900: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1880: 4), (1881: 3), (1898: 1), (1899: 5), (1900: 4), (1911: 1), (1947: 1), (1948: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
