The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1066(1 to 12), 1067(12 to 5), 1087(7 to 3), 1088(10 to 6), 1089(11 to 1), 1094(6 to 7), 1127(3 to 4), 1130(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1066: 80.000000), (1127: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1066: 4), (1067: 6), (1087: 1), (1088: 4), (1089: 4), (1094: 1), (1127: 2), (1130: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
