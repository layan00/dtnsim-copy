The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(1 to 12), 221(12 to 5), 240(7 to 3), 241(10 to 6), 242(11 to 1), 249(6 to 7), 281(3 to 4), 282(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 30.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 5), (221: 4), (240: 1), (241: 4), (242: 4), (249: 1), (281: 1), (282: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
