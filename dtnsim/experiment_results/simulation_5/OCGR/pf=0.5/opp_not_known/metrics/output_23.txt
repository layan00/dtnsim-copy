The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1483(1 to 12), 1484(12 to 5), 1505(7 to 3), 1506(10 to 6), 1507(11 to 1), 1511(6 to 7), 1542(3 to 4), 1543(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1543: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1483: 4), (1484: 6), (1505: 1), (1506: 4), (1507: 4), (1511: 1), (1542: 1), (1543: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
