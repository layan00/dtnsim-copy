The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(1 to 12), 218(12 to 5), 236(7 to 3), 237(10 to 6), 238(11 to 1), 246(6 to 7), 283(3 to 4), 285(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 30.000000), (238: 15.000000), (283: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 4), (218: 4), (236: 1), (237: 4), (238: 4), (246: 3), (283: 2), (285: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
