The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 12), 215(12 to 5), 232(7 to 3), 233(10 to 6), 234(11 to 1), 244(6 to 7), 280(3 to 4), 284(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 40.000000), (233: 45.000000), (234: 5.000000), (284: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 3), (215: 3), (232: 1), (233: 6), (234: 4), (244: 5), (280: 1), (284: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
