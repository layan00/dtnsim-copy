The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 12), 225(12 to 5), 244(7 to 3), 245(10 to 6), 246(11 to 1), 252(6 to 7), 285(3 to 4), 290(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 25.000000), (285: 10.000000), (290: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 4), (225: 1), (244: 1), (245: 6), (246: 5), (252: 1), (285: 2), (290: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
