The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
643(1 to 12), 644(12 to 5), 663(7 to 3), 664(10 to 6), 665(11 to 1), 668(6 to 7), 702(3 to 4), 706(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(643: 80.000000), (644: 70.000000), (665: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(643: 4), (644: 7), (663: 1), (664: 3), (665: 5), (668: 5), (702: 1), (706: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
