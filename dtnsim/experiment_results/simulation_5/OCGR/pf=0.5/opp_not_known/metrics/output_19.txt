The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1905(1 to 12), 1906(12 to 5), 1926(7 to 3), 1927(10 to 6), 1928(11 to 1), 1935(6 to 7), 1968(3 to 4), 1972(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1905: 80.000000), (1906: 30.000000), (1928: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1905: 4), (1906: 4), (1926: 1), (1927: 4), (1928: 5), (1935: 3), (1968: 1), (1972: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
