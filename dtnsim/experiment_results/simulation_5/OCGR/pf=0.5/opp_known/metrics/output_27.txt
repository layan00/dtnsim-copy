The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
792(1 to 12), 793(12 to 5), 802(7 to 3), 803(10 to 6), 804(11 to 1), 808(6 to 7), 831(3 to 4), 837(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(792: 80.000000), (793: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(792: 5), (793: 6), (802: 1), (803: 5), (804: 5), (808: 3), (831: 2), (837: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
