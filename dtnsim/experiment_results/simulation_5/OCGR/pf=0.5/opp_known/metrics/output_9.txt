The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1385(1 to 12), 1386(12 to 5), 1391(7 to 3), 1392(10 to 6), 1393(11 to 1), 1404(6 to 7), 1431(3 to 4), 1432(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1386: 40.000000), (1393: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1385: 7), (1386: 4), (1391: 1), (1392: 5), (1393: 4), (1404: 1), (1431: 1), (1432: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
