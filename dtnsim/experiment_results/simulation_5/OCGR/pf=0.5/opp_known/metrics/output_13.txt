The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1118(1 to 12), 1119(12 to 5), 1128(7 to 3), 1129(10 to 6), 1130(11 to 1), 1134(6 to 7), 1159(3 to 4), 1165(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1119: 30.000000), (1128: 25.000000), (1129: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1118: 4), (1119: 4), (1128: 3), (1129: 5), (1130: 2), (1134: 1), (1159: 2), (1165: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
