The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1411(1 to 12), 1412(12 to 5), 1418(7 to 3), 1419(10 to 6), 1420(11 to 1), 1427(6 to 7), 1453(3 to 4), 1454(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1411: 80.000000), (1419: 65.000000), (1420: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1411: 5), (1412: 6), (1418: 1), (1419: 5), (1420: 4), (1427: 5), (1453: 1), (1454: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
