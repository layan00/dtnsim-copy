The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 12), 216(12 to 5), 225(7 to 3), 226(10 to 6), 227(11 to 1), 235(6 to 7), 263(3 to 4), 265(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 30.000000), (216: 30.000000), (227: 15.000000), (263: 10.000000), (265: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 5), (216: 4), (225: 1), (226: 4), (227: 4), (235: 3), (263: 2), (265: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
