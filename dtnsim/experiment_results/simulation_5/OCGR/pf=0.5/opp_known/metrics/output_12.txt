The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
813(1 to 12), 814(12 to 5), 822(7 to 3), 823(10 to 6), 824(11 to 1), 829(6 to 7), 853(3 to 4), 856(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(813: 40.000000), (853: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(813: 7), (814: 6), (822: 1), (823: 4), (824: 2), (829: 1), (853: 2), (856: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
