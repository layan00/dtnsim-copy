The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(1 to 12), 209(12 to 5), 216(7 to 3), 217(10 to 6), 218(11 to 1), 225(6 to 7), 244(3 to 4), 245(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 30.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 5), (209: 4), (216: 1), (217: 4), (218: 2), (225: 1), (244: 1), (245: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
