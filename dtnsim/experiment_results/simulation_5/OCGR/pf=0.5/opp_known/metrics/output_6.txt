The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
509(1 to 12), 510(12 to 5), 513(7 to 3), 514(10 to 6), 515(11 to 1), 523(6 to 7), 550(3 to 4), 551(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(514: 15.000000), (551: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(509: 3), (510: 2), (513: 1), (514: 4), (515: 2), (523: 3), (550: 1), (551: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 509: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
