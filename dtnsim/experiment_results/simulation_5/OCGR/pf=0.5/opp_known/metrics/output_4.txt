The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1406(1 to 12), 1407(12 to 5), 1415(7 to 3), 1416(10 to 6), 1417(11 to 1), 1422(6 to 7), 1448(3 to 4), 1450(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1406: 40.000000), (1415: 45.000000), (1450: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1406: 6), (1407: 6), (1415: 3), (1416: 4), (1417: 2), (1422: 5), (1448: 1), (1450: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
