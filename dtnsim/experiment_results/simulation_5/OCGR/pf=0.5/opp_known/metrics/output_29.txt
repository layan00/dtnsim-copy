The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1395(1 to 12), 1396(12 to 5), 1402(7 to 3), 1403(10 to 6), 1404(11 to 1), 1412(6 to 7), 1437(3 to 4), 1438(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1395: 30.000000), (1404: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1395: 5), (1396: 2), (1402: 1), (1403: 5), (1404: 4), (1412: 3), (1437: 1), (1438: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
