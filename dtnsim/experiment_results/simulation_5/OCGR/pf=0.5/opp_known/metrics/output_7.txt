The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
804(1 to 12), 805(12 to 5), 810(7 to 3), 811(10 to 6), 812(11 to 1), 820(6 to 7), 841(3 to 4), 846(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(804: 5), (805: 2), (810: 3), (811: 6), (812: 2), (820: 3), (841: 1), (846: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
