The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
809(1 to 12), 810(12 to 5), 819(7 to 3), 820(10 to 6), 821(11 to 1), 827(6 to 7), 845(3 to 4), 849(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(809: 80.000000), (810: 30.000000), (845: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(809: 5), (810: 4), (819: 3), (820: 3), (821: 7), (827: 1), (845: 2), (849: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
