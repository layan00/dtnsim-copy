The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1095(1 to 12), 1096(12 to 5), 1104(7 to 3), 1105(10 to 6), 1106(11 to 1), 1110(6 to 7), 1135(3 to 4), 1136(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1096: 70.000000), (1106: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1095: 4), (1096: 7), (1104: 1), (1105: 4), (1106: 4), (1110: 3), (1135: 1), (1136: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
