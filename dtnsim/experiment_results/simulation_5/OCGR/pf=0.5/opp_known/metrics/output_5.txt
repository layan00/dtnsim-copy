The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(1 to 12), 206(12 to 5), 212(7 to 3), 213(10 to 6), 214(11 to 1), 222(6 to 7), 250(3 to 4), 252(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 30.000000), (214: 15.000000), (250: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 7), (206: 4), (212: 1), (213: 4), (214: 4), (222: 3), (250: 2), (252: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
