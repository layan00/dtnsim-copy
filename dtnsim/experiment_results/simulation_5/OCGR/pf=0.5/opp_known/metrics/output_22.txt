The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
816(1 to 12), 817(12 to 5), 821(7 to 3), 822(10 to 6), 823(11 to 1), 828(6 to 7), 855(3 to 4), 860(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(816: 40.000000), (823: 25.000000), (855: 10.000000), (860: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(816: 7), (817: 2), (821: 1), (822: 3), (823: 5), (828: 3), (855: 2), (860: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
