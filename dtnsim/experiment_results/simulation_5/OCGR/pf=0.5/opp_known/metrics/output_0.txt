The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(1 to 12), 213(12 to 5), 220(7 to 3), 221(10 to 6), 222(11 to 1), 228(6 to 7), 249(3 to 4), 254(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(222: 25.000000), (249: 10.000000), (254: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 4), (213: 2), (220: 1), (221: 6), (222: 5), (228: 1), (249: 2), (254: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
