The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1117(1 to 12), 1118(12 to 5), 1127(7 to 3), 1128(10 to 6), 1129(11 to 1), 1133(6 to 7), 1151(3 to 4), 1152(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1117: 4), (1118: 6), (1127: 1), (1128: 4), (1129: 2), (1133: 1), (1151: 1), (1152: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
