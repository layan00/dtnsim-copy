The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1093(1 to 12), 1094(12 to 5), 1101(7 to 3), 1102(10 to 6), 1103(11 to 1), 1113(6 to 7), 1138(3 to 4), 1142(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1094: 30.000000), (1102: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1093: 3), (1094: 4), (1101: 3), (1102: 4), (1103: 2), (1113: 7), (1138: 1), (1142: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
