The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
519(1 to 12), 520(12 to 5), 525(7 to 3), 526(10 to 6), 527(11 to 1), 533(6 to 7), 561(3 to 4), 563(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(520: 40.000000), (561: 10.000000), (563: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(519: 7), (520: 4), (525: 1), (526: 4), (527: 5), (533: 1), (561: 2), (563: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
