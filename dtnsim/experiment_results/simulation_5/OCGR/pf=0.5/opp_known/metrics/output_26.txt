The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
499(1 to 12), 500(12 to 5), 505(7 to 3), 506(10 to 6), 507(11 to 1), 513(6 to 7), 531(3 to 4), 537(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(505: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(499: 5), (500: 2), (505: 3), (506: 5), (507: 5), (513: 1), (531: 1), (537: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
