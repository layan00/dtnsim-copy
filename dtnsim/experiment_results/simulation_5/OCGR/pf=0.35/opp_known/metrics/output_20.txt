The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 12), 219(12 to 5), 228(7 to 3), 229(10 to 6), 230(11 to 1), 238(6 to 7), 271(3 to 4), 273(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 30.000000), (219: 30.000000), (230: 15.000000), (238: 5.000000), (271: 10.000000), (273: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 5), (219: 4), (228: 1), (229: 4), (230: 4), (238: 5), (271: 2), (273: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
