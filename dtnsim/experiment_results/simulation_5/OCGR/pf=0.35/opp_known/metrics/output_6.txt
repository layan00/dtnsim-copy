The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
540(1 to 12), 541(12 to 5), 549(7 to 3), 550(10 to 6), 551(11 to 1), 563(6 to 7), 590(3 to 4), 591(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(541: 30.000000), (550: 15.000000), (591: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(540: 4), (541: 4), (549: 1), (550: 4), (551: 5), (563: 3), (590: 1), (591: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
