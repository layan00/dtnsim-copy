The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
841(1 to 12), 842(12 to 5), 852(7 to 3), 853(10 to 6), 854(11 to 1), 860(6 to 7), 884(3 to 4), 894(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(841: 30.000000), (842: 50.000000), (852: 25.000000), (853: 45.000000), (884: 10.000000), (894: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(841: 5), (842: 6), (852: 3), (853: 5), (854: 5), (860: 3), (884: 2), (894: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
