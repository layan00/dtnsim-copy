The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1168(1 to 12), 1169(12 to 5), 1178(7 to 3), 1179(10 to 6), 1180(11 to 1), 1191(6 to 7), 1216(3 to 4), 1217(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1168: 30.000000), (1169: 30.000000), (1179: 15.000000), (1217: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1168: 5), (1169: 4), (1178: 1), (1179: 4), (1180: 2), (1191: 3), (1216: 1), (1217: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
