The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
554(1 to 12), 555(12 to 5), 564(7 to 3), 565(10 to 6), 566(11 to 1), 574(6 to 7), 601(3 to 4), 607(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(555: 50.000000), (566: 55.000000), (574: 5.000000), (601: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(554: 5), (555: 6), (564: 1), (565: 5), (566: 8), (574: 5), (601: 2), (607: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
