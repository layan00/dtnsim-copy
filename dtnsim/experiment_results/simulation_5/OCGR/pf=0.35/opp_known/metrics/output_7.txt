The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
857(1 to 12), 858(12 to 5), 864(7 to 3), 865(10 to 6), 866(11 to 1), 875(6 to 7), 904(3 to 4), 910(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(857: 80.000000), (858: 40.000000), (864: 45.000000), (866: 55.000000), (875: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(857: 5), (858: 4), (864: 3), (865: 6), (866: 9), (875: 5), (904: 1), (910: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
