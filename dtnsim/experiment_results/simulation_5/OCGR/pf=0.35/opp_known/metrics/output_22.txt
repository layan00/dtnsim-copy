The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
851(1 to 12), 852(12 to 5), 856(7 to 3), 857(10 to 6), 858(11 to 1), 866(6 to 7), 894(3 to 4), 901(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(851: 40.000000), (858: 25.000000), (894: 10.000000), (901: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(851: 7), (852: 2), (856: 1), (857: 5), (858: 5), (866: 3), (894: 2), (901: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
