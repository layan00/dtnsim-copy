The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1183(1 to 12), 1184(12 to 5), 1193(7 to 3), 1194(10 to 6), 1195(11 to 1), 1202(6 to 7), 1231(3 to 4), 1236(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1184: 30.000000), (1193: 25.000000), (1194: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1183: 4), (1184: 4), (1193: 3), (1194: 4), (1195: 2), (1202: 1), (1231: 2), (1236: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
