The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(1 to 12), 223(12 to 5), 233(7 to 3), 234(10 to 6), 235(11 to 1), 245(6 to 7), 277(3 to 4), 286(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(222: 30.000000), (223: 30.000000), (233: 25.000000), (235: 25.000000), (245: 5.000000), (277: 10.000000), (286: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 5), (223: 4), (233: 3), (234: 5), (235: 5), (245: 5), (277: 2), (286: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
