The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(1 to 12), 214(12 to 5), 222(7 to 3), 223(10 to 6), 224(11 to 1), 231(6 to 7), 256(3 to 4), 260(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 40.000000), (214: 30.000000), (222: 45.000000), (223: 45.000000), (256: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 6), (214: 4), (222: 3), (223: 5), (224: 2), (231: 1), (256: 2), (260: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
