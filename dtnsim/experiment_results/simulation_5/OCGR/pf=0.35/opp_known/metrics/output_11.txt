The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
525(1 to 12), 526(12 to 5), 535(7 to 3), 536(10 to 6), 537(11 to 1), 544(6 to 7), 574(3 to 4), 580(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(525: 40.000000), (526: 30.000000), (535: 45.000000), (544: 55.000000), (574: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(525: 7), (526: 4), (535: 3), (536: 5), (537: 2), (544: 9), (574: 2), (580: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
