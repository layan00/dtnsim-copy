The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(1 to 12), 528(12 to 5), 533(7 to 3), 534(10 to 6), 535(11 to 1), 544(6 to 7), 569(3 to 4), 575(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(527: 40.000000), (533: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 7), (528: 2), (533: 3), (534: 5), (535: 5), (544: 3), (569: 1), (575: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
