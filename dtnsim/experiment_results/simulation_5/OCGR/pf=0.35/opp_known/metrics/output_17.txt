The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
847(1 to 12), 848(12 to 5), 857(7 to 3), 858(10 to 6), 859(11 to 1), 868(6 to 7), 893(3 to 4), 900(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(847: 40.000000), (848: 30.000000), (893: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(847: 7), (848: 4), (857: 3), (858: 6), (859: 7), (868: 1), (893: 2), (900: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
