The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1163(1 to 12), 1164(12 to 5), 1171(7 to 3), 1172(10 to 6), 1173(11 to 1), 1184(6 to 7), 1214(3 to 4), 1216(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1164: 30.000000), (1172: 15.000000), (1184: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1163: 4), (1164: 4), (1171: 3), (1172: 4), (1173: 2), (1184: 5), (1214: 1), (1216: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
