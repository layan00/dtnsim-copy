The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1967(1 to 12), 1968(12 to 5), 1989(7 to 3), 1990(10 to 6), 1991(11 to 1), 2003(6 to 7), 2039(3 to 4), 2041(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1967: 80.000000), (1968: 30.000000), (1991: 5.000000), (2041: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1967: 4), (1968: 4), (1989: 1), (1990: 6), (1991: 4), (2003: 3), (2039: 2), (2041: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
