The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1972(1 to 12), 1973(12 to 5), 1991(7 to 3), 1992(10 to 6), 1993(11 to 1), 2001(6 to 7), 2042(3 to 4), 2051(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1972: 80.000000), (1991: 25.000000), (1992: 65.000000), (1993: 15.000000), (2001: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1972: 5), (1973: 7), (1991: 3), (1992: 5), (1993: 4), (2001: 10), (2042: 1), (2051: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 47 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
