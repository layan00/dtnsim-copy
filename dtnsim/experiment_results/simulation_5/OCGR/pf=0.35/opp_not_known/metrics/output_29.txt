The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1973(1 to 12), 1974(12 to 5), 1992(7 to 3), 1993(10 to 6), 1994(11 to 1), 2002(6 to 7), 2046(3 to 4), 2051(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1973: 30.000000), (1974: 40.000000), (1994: 15.000000), (2051: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1973: 5), (1974: 3), (1992: 3), (1993: 4), (1994: 4), (2002: 7), (2046: 1), (2051: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
