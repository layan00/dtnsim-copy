The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1981(1 to 12), 1982(12 to 5), 2002(7 to 3), 2003(10 to 6), 2004(11 to 1), 2016(6 to 7), 2054(3 to 4), 2061(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1981: 80.000000), (1982: 50.000000), (2004: 5.000000), (2061: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1981: 4), (1982: 6), (2002: 1), (2003: 6), (2004: 4), (2016: 7), (2054: 2), (2061: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
