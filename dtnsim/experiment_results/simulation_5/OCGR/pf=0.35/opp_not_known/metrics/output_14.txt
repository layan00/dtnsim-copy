The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1991(1 to 12), 1992(12 to 5), 2011(7 to 3), 2012(10 to 6), 2013(11 to 1), 2019(6 to 7), 2061(3 to 4), 2065(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1992: 40.000000), (2012: 65.000000), (2013: 15.000000), (2065: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1991: 9), (1992: 3), (2011: 1), (2012: 6), (2013: 4), (2019: 6), (2061: 2), (2065: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
