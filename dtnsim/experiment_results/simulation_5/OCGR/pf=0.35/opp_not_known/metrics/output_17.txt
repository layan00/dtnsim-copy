The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1093(1 to 12), 1094(12 to 5), 1115(7 to 3), 1116(10 to 6), 1117(11 to 1), 1126(6 to 7), 1159(3 to 4), 1166(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1093: 80.000000), (1094: 30.000000), (1159: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1093: 4), (1094: 4), (1115: 3), (1116: 6), (1117: 5), (1126: 1), (1159: 2), (1166: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
