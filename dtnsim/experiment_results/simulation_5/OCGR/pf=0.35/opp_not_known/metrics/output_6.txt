The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
670(1 to 12), 671(12 to 5), 691(7 to 3), 692(10 to 6), 693(11 to 1), 705(6 to 7), 744(3 to 4), 745(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(671: 30.000000), (692: 15.000000), (745: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(670: 4), (671: 4), (691: 1), (692: 4), (693: 4), (705: 3), (744: 1), (745: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
