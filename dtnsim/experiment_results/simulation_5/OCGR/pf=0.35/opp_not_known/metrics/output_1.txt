The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
686(1 to 12), 687(12 to 5), 708(7 to 3), 709(10 to 6), 710(11 to 1), 718(6 to 7), 757(3 to 4), 763(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(687: 50.000000), (718: 5.000000), (757: 10.000000), (763: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(686: 5), (687: 6), (708: 1), (709: 5), (710: 5), (718: 5), (757: 2), (763: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
