The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
667(1 to 12), 668(12 to 5), 685(7 to 3), 686(10 to 6), 687(11 to 1), 697(6 to 7), 737(3 to 4), 739(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(668: 40.000000), (686: 15.000000), (737: 10.000000), (739: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(667: 4), (668: 3), (685: 1), (686: 4), (687: 4), (697: 1), (737: 2), (739: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
