The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1531(1 to 12), 1532(12 to 5), 1553(7 to 3), 1554(10 to 6), 1555(11 to 1), 1566(6 to 7), 1604(3 to 4), 1605(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1531: 30.000000), (1532: 30.000000), (1554: 15.000000), (1605: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1531: 5), (1532: 4), (1553: 1), (1554: 4), (1555: 5), (1566: 3), (1604: 1), (1605: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
