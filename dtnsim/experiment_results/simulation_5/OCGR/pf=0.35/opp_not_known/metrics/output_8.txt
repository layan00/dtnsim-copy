The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1548(1 to 12), 1549(12 to 5), 1572(7 to 3), 1573(10 to 6), 1574(11 to 1), 1584(6 to 7), 1626(3 to 4), 1627(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1548: 30.000000), (1549: 30.000000), (1584: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1548: 5), (1549: 4), (1572: 1), (1573: 4), (1574: 4), (1584: 5), (1626: 1), (1627: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
