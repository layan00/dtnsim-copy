The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
230(1 to 12), 231(12 to 5), 252(7 to 3), 253(10 to 6), 254(11 to 1), 262(6 to 7), 307(3 to 4), 309(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(230: 30.000000), (231: 30.000000), (254: 15.000000), (262: 5.000000), (307: 10.000000), (309: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(230: 5), (231: 4), (252: 1), (253: 4), (254: 4), (262: 5), (307: 2), (309: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
