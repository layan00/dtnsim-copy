The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1097(1 to 12), 1098(12 to 5), 1114(7 to 3), 1115(10 to 6), 1116(11 to 1), 1124(6 to 7), 1160(3 to 4), 1167(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1097: 80.000000), (1116: 25.000000), (1160: 10.000000), (1167: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1097: 4), (1098: 1), (1114: 1), (1115: 5), (1116: 5), (1124: 3), (1160: 2), (1167: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
