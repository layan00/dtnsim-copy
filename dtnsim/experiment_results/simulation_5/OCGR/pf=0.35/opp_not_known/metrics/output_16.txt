The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
659(1 to 12), 660(12 to 5), 680(7 to 3), 681(10 to 6), 682(11 to 1), 688(6 to 7), 724(3 to 4), 732(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(659: 80.000000), (660: 70.000000), (680: 45.000000), (681: 45.000000), (682: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(659: 4), (660: 7), (680: 3), (681: 6), (682: 5), (688: 5), (724: 1), (732: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
