The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(1 to 12), 225(12 to 5), 243(7 to 3), 244(10 to 6), 245(11 to 1), 249(6 to 7), 292(3 to 4), 296(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 80.000000), (245: 15.000000), (249: 55.000000), (292: 10.000000), (296: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 5), (225: 6), (243: 1), (244: 5), (245: 4), (249: 9), (292: 2), (296: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
