The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(1 to 12), 226(12 to 5), 246(7 to 3), 247(10 to 6), 248(11 to 1), 255(6 to 7), 290(3 to 4), 298(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(226: 30.000000), (246: 45.000000), (247: 45.000000), (290: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 7), (226: 4), (246: 3), (247: 5), (248: 5), (255: 1), (290: 2), (298: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
