The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
661(1 to 12), 662(12 to 5), 679(7 to 3), 680(10 to 6), 681(11 to 1), 690(6 to 7), 723(3 to 4), 729(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(679: 45.000000), (729: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(661: 4), (662: 1), (679: 3), (680: 5), (681: 5), (690: 3), (723: 1), (729: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
