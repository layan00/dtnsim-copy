The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
602(1 to 12), 603(12 to 5), 609(7 to 3), 610(10 to 6), 611(11 to 1), 619(6 to 7), 636(3 to 4), 641(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(602: 30.000000), (603: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(602: 5), (603: 4), (609: 3), (610: 4), (611: 5), (619: 4), (636: 1), (641: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
