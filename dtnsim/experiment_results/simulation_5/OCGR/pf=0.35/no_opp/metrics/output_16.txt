The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(1 to 12), 209(12 to 5), 212(7 to 3), 213(10 to 6), 214(11 to 1), 220(6 to 7), 231(3 to 4), 233(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 2), (209: 2), (212: 3), (213: 2), (214: 2), (220: 2), (231: 1), (233: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 208: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
