The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
467(1 to 12), 468(12 to 5), 472(7 to 3), 473(10 to 6), 474(11 to 1), 484(6 to 7), 506(3 to 4), 509(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(468: 40.000000), (473: 15.000000), (484: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(467: 4), (468: 3), (472: 3), (473: 4), (474: 5), (484: 5), (506: 1), (509: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
