The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
476(1 to 12), 477(12 to 5), 483(7 to 3), 484(10 to 6), 485(11 to 1), 491(6 to 7), 512(3 to 4), 520(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(477: 40.000000), (483: 25.000000), (484: 15.000000), (485: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(476: 4), (477: 3), (483: 3), (484: 4), (485: 6), (491: 1), (512: 2), (520: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
