The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
578(1 to 12), 579(12 to 5), 583(7 to 3), 584(10 to 6), 585(11 to 1), 596(6 to 7), 608(3 to 4), 610(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(578: 80.000000), (585: 5.000000), (610: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(578: 4), (579: 1), (583: 1), (584: 6), (585: 4), (596: 3), (608: 2), (610: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
