The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
626(1 to 12), 627(12 to 5), 633(7 to 3), 634(10 to 6), 635(11 to 1), 645(6 to 7), 657(3 to 4), 660(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(626: 80.000000), (633: 45.000000), (635: 5.000000), (660: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(626: 7), (627: 2), (633: 3), (634: 2), (635: 4), (645: 2), (657: 1), (660: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
