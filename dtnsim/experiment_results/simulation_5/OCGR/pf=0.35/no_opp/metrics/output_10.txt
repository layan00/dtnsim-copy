The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(1 to 12), 82(12 to 5), 87(7 to 3), 88(10 to 6), 89(11 to 1), 95(6 to 7), 106(3 to 4), 112(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(87: 45.000000), (88: 45.000000), (106: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 5), (82: 1), (87: 3), (88: 5), (89: 5), (95: 1), (106: 2), (112: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
