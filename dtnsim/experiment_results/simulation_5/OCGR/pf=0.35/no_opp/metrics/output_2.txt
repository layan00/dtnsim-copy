The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
368(1 to 12), 369(12 to 5), 375(7 to 3), 376(10 to 6), 377(11 to 1), 386(6 to 7), 397(3 to 4), 401(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(375: 45.000000), (397: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(368: 4), (369: 2), (375: 3), (376: 2), (377: 5), (386: 4), (397: 2), (401: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
