The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
336(1 to 12), 337(12 to 5), 341(7 to 3), 342(10 to 6), 343(11 to 1), 350(6 to 7), 364(3 to 4), 366(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(336: 80.000000), (342: 65.000000), (364: 10.000000), (366: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(336: 4), (337: 2), (341: 1), (342: 6), (343: 4), (350: 4), (364: 2), (366: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
