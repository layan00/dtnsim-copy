The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
352(1 to 12), 353(12 to 5), 355(7 to 3), 356(10 to 6), 357(11 to 1), 365(6 to 7), 377(3 to 4), 379(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(352: 80.000000), (377: 10.000000), (379: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(352: 4), (353: 1), (355: 1), (356: 2), (357: 2), (365: 3), (377: 2), (379: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
