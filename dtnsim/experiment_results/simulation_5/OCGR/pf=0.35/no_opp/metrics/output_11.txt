The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(1 to 12), 210(12 to 5), 214(7 to 3), 215(10 to 6), 216(11 to 1), 222(6 to 7), 236(3 to 4), 240(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 45.000000), (236: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 2), (210: 2), (214: 3), (215: 2), (216: 5), (222: 2), (236: 2), (240: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
