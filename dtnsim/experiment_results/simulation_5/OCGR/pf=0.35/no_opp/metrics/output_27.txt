The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
332(1 to 12), 333(12 to 5), 340(7 to 3), 341(10 to 6), 342(11 to 1), 348(6 to 7), 360(3 to 4), 366(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(332: 30.000000), (340: 25.000000), (341: 45.000000), (360: 10.000000), (366: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(332: 5), (333: 1), (340: 3), (341: 5), (342: 2), (348: 3), (360: 2), (366: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
