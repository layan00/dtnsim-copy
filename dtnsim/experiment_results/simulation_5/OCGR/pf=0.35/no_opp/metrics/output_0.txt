The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
90(1 to 12), 91(12 to 5), 98(7 to 3), 99(10 to 6), 100(11 to 1), 109(6 to 7), 130(3 to 4), 136(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(90: 30.000000), (98: 25.000000), (109: 5.000000), (130: 10.000000), (136: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(90: 5), (91: 2), (98: 3), (99: 5), (100: 2), (109: 5), (130: 2), (136: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
