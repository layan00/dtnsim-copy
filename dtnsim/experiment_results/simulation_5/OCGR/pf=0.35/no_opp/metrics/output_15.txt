The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 12), 81(12 to 5), 84(7 to 3), 85(10 to 6), 86(11 to 1), 90(6 to 7), 109(3 to 4), 112(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 80.000000), (81: 40.000000), (86: 25.000000), (109: 10.000000), (112: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 5), (81: 3), (84: 1), (85: 5), (86: 4), (90: 2), (109: 2), (112: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
