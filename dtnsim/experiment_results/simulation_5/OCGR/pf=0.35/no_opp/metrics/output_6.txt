The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
218(1 to 12), 219(12 to 5), 224(7 to 3), 225(10 to 6), 226(11 to 1), 237(6 to 7), 252(3 to 4), 253(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 15.000000), (253: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(218: 4), (219: 1), (224: 1), (225: 4), (226: 4), (237: 3), (252: 1), (253: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
