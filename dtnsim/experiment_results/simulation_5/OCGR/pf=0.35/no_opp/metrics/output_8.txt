The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
483(1 to 12), 484(12 to 5), 492(7 to 3), 493(10 to 6), 494(11 to 1), 503(6 to 7), 523(3 to 4), 525(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(483: 30.000000), (484: 50.000000), (503: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(483: 5), (484: 4), (492: 1), (493: 4), (494: 4), (503: 5), (523: 1), (525: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
