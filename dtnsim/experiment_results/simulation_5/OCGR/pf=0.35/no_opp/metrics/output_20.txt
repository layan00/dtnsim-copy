The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
86(1 to 12), 87(12 to 5), 93(7 to 3), 94(10 to 6), 95(11 to 1), 102(6 to 7), 123(3 to 4), 128(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(86: 30.000000), (87: 50.000000), (95: 25.000000), (102: 5.000000), (123: 10.000000), (128: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(86: 5), (87: 4), (93: 1), (94: 4), (95: 5), (102: 5), (123: 2), (128: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
