The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(1 to 12), 223(12 to 5), 226(7 to 3), 227(10 to 6), 228(11 to 1), 238(6 to 7), 254(3 to 4), 256(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 40.000000), (227: 15.000000), (254: 10.000000), (256: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 4), (223: 3), (226: 1), (227: 4), (228: 4), (238: 1), (254: 2), (256: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
