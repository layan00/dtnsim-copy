The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
493(1 to 12), 494(12 to 5), 498(7 to 3), 499(10 to 6), 500(11 to 1), 511(6 to 7), 524(3 to 4), 528(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(500: 5.000000), (524: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(493: 4), (494: 1), (498: 3), (499: 5), (500: 4), (511: 3), (524: 2), (528: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
