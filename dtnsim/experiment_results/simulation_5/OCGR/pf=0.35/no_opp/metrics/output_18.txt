The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
449(1 to 12), 450(12 to 5), 454(7 to 3), 455(10 to 6), 456(11 to 1), 464(6 to 7), 476(3 to 4), 479(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(449: 80.000000), (454: 45.000000), (476: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(449: 5), (450: 2), (454: 3), (455: 2), (456: 2), (464: 4), (476: 2), (479: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
