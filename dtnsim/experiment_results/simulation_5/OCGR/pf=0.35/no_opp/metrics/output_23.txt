The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
481(1 to 12), 482(12 to 5), 488(7 to 3), 489(10 to 6), 490(11 to 1), 500(6 to 7), 514(3 to 4), 515(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(481: 30.000000), (489: 15.000000), (515: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(481: 5), (482: 1), (488: 1), (489: 4), (490: 4), (500: 3), (514: 1), (515: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
