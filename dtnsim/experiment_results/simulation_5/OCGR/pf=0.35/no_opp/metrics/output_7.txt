The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
351(1 to 12), 352(12 to 5), 356(7 to 3), 357(10 to 6), 358(11 to 1), 367(6 to 7), 382(3 to 4), 385(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(356: 45.000000), (367: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(351: 2), (352: 2), (356: 3), (357: 2), (358: 5), (367: 5), (382: 1), (385: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
