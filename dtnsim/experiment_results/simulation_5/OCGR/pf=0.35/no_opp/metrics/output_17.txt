The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
326(1 to 12), 327(12 to 5), 331(7 to 3), 332(10 to 6), 333(11 to 1), 341(6 to 7), 350(3 to 4), 354(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(350: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(326: 2), (327: 1), (331: 3), (332: 2), (333: 5), (341: 1), (350: 2), (354: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
