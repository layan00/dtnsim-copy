The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(1 to 12), 81(12 to 5), 87(7 to 3), 88(10 to 6), 89(11 to 1), 101(6 to 7), 112(3 to 4), 115(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(89: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 3), (81: 2), (87: 3), (88: 2), (89: 4), (101: 2), (112: 2), (115: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
