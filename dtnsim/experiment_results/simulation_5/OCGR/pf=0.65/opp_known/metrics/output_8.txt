The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1045(1 to 12), 1046(12 to 5), 1052(7 to 3), 1053(10 to 6), 1054(11 to 1), 1057(6 to 7), 1077(3 to 4), 1080(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1046: 70.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1045: 4), (1046: 7), (1052: 1), (1053: 4), (1054: 5), (1057: 5), (1077: 1), (1080: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
