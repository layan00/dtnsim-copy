The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
501(1 to 12), 502(12 to 5), 507(7 to 3), 508(10 to 6), 509(11 to 1), 515(6 to 7), 536(3 to 4), 538(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(502: 40.000000), (536: 10.000000), (538: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(501: 5), (502: 4), (507: 1), (508: 3), (509: 5), (515: 1), (536: 2), (538: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
