The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
488(1 to 12), 489(12 to 5), 494(7 to 3), 495(10 to 6), 496(11 to 1), 500(6 to 7), 532(3 to 4), 539(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(488: 40.000000), (489: 40.000000), (532: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(488: 7), (489: 4), (494: 1), (495: 5), (496: 5), (500: 9), (532: 2), (539: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
