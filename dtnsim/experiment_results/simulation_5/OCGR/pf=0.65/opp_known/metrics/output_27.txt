The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
750(1 to 12), 751(12 to 5), 760(7 to 3), 761(10 to 6), 762(11 to 1), 765(6 to 7), 786(3 to 4), 792(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(750: 80.000000), (751: 50.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(750: 5), (751: 6), (760: 1), (761: 5), (762: 5), (765: 1), (786: 2), (792: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
