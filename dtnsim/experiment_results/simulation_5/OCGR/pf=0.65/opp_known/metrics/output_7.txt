The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
767(1 to 12), 768(12 to 5), 773(7 to 3), 774(10 to 6), 775(11 to 1), 782(6 to 7), 800(3 to 4), 804(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(767: 5), (768: 2), (773: 3), (774: 5), (775: 2), (782: 1), (800: 1), (804: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
