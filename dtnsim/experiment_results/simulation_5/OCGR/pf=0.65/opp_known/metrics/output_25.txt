The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(1 to 12), 195(12 to 5), 198(7 to 3), 199(10 to 6), 200(11 to 1), 203(6 to 7), 221(3 to 4), 224(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 3), (195: 2), (198: 1), (199: 3), (200: 5), (203: 5), (221: 1), (224: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
