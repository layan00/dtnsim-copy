The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1324(1 to 12), 1325(12 to 5), 1329(7 to 3), 1330(10 to 6), 1331(11 to 1), 1336(6 to 7), 1361(3 to 4), 1363(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1324: 80.000000), (1325: 40.000000), (1331: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1324: 5), (1325: 4), (1329: 1), (1330: 5), (1331: 4), (1336: 1), (1361: 1), (1363: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
