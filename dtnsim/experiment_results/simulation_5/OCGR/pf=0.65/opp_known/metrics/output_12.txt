The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
790(1 to 12), 791(12 to 5), 798(7 to 3), 799(10 to 6), 800(11 to 1), 803(6 to 7), 821(3 to 4), 826(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(790: 80.000000), (821: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(790: 5), (791: 6), (798: 1), (799: 4), (800: 5), (803: 1), (821: 2), (826: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
