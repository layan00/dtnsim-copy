The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(1 to 12), 199(12 to 5), 205(7 to 3), 206(10 to 6), 207(11 to 1), 211(6 to 7), 239(3 to 4), 242(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 15.000000), (239: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 7), (199: 6), (205: 1), (206: 4), (207: 4), (211: 3), (239: 2), (242: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
