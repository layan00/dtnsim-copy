The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1317(1 to 12), 1318(12 to 5), 1322(7 to 3), 1323(10 to 6), 1324(11 to 1), 1326(6 to 7), 1348(3 to 4), 1352(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1317: 40.000000), (1322: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1317: 6), (1318: 2), (1322: 3), (1323: 3), (1324: 5), (1326: 1), (1348: 1), (1352: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
