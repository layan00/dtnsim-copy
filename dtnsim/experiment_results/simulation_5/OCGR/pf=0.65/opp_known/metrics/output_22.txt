The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
788(1 to 12), 789(12 to 5), 793(7 to 3), 794(10 to 6), 795(11 to 1), 799(6 to 7), 827(3 to 4), 837(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(788: 40.000000), (795: 25.000000), (827: 10.000000), (837: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(788: 7), (789: 2), (793: 1), (794: 3), (795: 5), (799: 11), (827: 2), (837: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
