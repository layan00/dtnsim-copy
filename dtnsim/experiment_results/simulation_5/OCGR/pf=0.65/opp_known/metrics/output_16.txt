The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
486(1 to 12), 487(12 to 5), 490(7 to 3), 491(10 to 6), 492(11 to 1), 494(6 to 7), 515(3 to 4), 519(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(486: 80.000000), (492: 25.000000), (519: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(486: 5), (487: 2), (490: 1), (491: 3), (492: 5), (494: 5), (515: 1), (519: 7), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
