The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
485(1 to 12), 486(12 to 5), 489(7 to 3), 490(10 to 6), 491(11 to 1), 499(6 to 7), 519(3 to 4), 522(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(522: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(485: 3), (486: 2), (489: 1), (490: 5), (491: 2), (499: 3), (519: 1), (522: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
