The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
209(1 to 12), 210(12 to 5), 218(7 to 3), 219(10 to 6), 220(11 to 1), 224(6 to 7), 249(3 to 4), 253(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 80.000000), (210: 50.000000), (220: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(209: 5), (210: 6), (218: 1), (219: 3), (220: 4), (224: 3), (249: 2), (253: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
