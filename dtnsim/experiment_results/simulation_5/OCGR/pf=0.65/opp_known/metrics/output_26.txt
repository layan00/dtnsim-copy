The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
465(1 to 12), 466(12 to 5), 471(7 to 3), 472(10 to 6), 473(11 to 1), 476(6 to 7), 493(3 to 4), 499(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(471: 45.000000), (499: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(465: 5), (466: 2), (471: 3), (472: 5), (473: 5), (476: 1), (493: 1), (499: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
