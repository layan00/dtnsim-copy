The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1087(1 to 12), 1088(12 to 5), 1095(7 to 3), 1096(10 to 6), 1097(11 to 1), 1101(6 to 7), 1115(3 to 4), 1116(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1087: 80.000000), (1096: 65.000000), (1116: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1087: 5), (1088: 6), (1095: 1), (1096: 4), (1097: 2), (1101: 1), (1115: 1), (1116: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
