The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(1 to 12), 204(12 to 5), 207(7 to 3), 208(10 to 6), 209(11 to 1), 211(6 to 7), 237(3 to 4), 238(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 80.000000), (209: 15.000000), (238: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 5), (204: 2), (207: 1), (208: 4), (209: 4), (211: 5), (237: 1), (238: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
