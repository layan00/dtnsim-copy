The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1320(1 to 12), 1321(12 to 5), 1325(7 to 3), 1326(10 to 6), 1327(11 to 1), 1331(6 to 7), 1347(3 to 4), 1351(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1327: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1320: 5), (1321: 2), (1325: 1), (1326: 4), (1327: 5), (1331: 1), (1347: 1), (1351: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
