The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
766(1 to 12), 767(12 to 5), 772(7 to 3), 773(10 to 6), 774(11 to 1), 776(6 to 7), 792(3 to 4), 795(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(766: 80.000000), (792: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(766: 5), (767: 2), (772: 3), (773: 3), (774: 2), (776: 1), (792: 2), (795: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
