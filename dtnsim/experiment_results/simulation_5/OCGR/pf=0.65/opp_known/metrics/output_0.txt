The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(1 to 12), 203(12 to 5), 209(7 to 3), 210(10 to 6), 211(11 to 1), 216(6 to 7), 234(3 to 4), 238(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 5), (203: 2), (209: 1), (210: 6), (211: 5), (216: 1), (234: 2), (238: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
