The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1082(1 to 12), 1083(12 to 5), 1090(7 to 3), 1091(10 to 6), 1092(11 to 1), 1096(6 to 7), 1123(3 to 4), 1128(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1082: 40.000000), (1083: 30.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1082: 6), (1083: 4), (1090: 3), (1091: 5), (1092: 2), (1096: 1), (1123: 2), (1128: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
