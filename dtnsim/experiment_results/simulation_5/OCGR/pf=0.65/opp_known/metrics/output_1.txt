The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
485(1 to 12), 486(12 to 5), 490(7 to 3), 491(10 to 6), 492(11 to 1), 497(6 to 7), 521(3 to 4), 523(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(485: 40.000000), (521: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(485: 7), (486: 2), (490: 1), (491: 3), (492: 2), (497: 3), (521: 2), (523: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
