The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
265(1 to 12), 266(12 to 5), 268(7 to 3), 269(10 to 6), 270(11 to 1), 275(6 to 7), 277(3 to 4), 279(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(265: 2), (266: 1), (268: 1), (269: 2), (270: 3), (275: 1), (277: 2), (279: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 265: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
