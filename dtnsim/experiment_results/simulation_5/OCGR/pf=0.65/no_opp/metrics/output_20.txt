The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
77(1 to 12), 78(12 to 5), 81(7 to 3), 82(10 to 6), 83(11 to 1), 87(6 to 7), 98(3 to 4), 101(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(77: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(77: 4), (78: 1), (81: 1), (82: 3), (83: 5), (87: 3), (98: 2), (101: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
