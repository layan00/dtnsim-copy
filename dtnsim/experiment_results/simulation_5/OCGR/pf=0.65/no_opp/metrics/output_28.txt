The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
350(1 to 12), 351(12 to 5), 355(7 to 3), 356(10 to 6), 357(11 to 1), 363(6 to 7), 375(3 to 4), 377(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(351: 40.000000), (356: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(350: 3), (351: 3), (355: 3), (356: 4), (357: 3), (363: 1), (375: 1), (377: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
