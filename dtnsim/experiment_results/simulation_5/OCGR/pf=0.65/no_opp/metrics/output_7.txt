The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
264(1 to 12), 265(12 to 5), 268(7 to 3), 269(10 to 6), 270(11 to 1), 277(6 to 7), 284(3 to 4), 287(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(264: 2), (265: 1), (268: 3), (269: 2), (270: 5), (277: 1), (284: 1), (287: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
