The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
183(1 to 12), 184(12 to 5), 187(7 to 3), 188(10 to 6), 189(11 to 1), 195(6 to 7), 202(3 to 4), 204(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 10.000000), (204: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(183: 3), (184: 2), (187: 1), (188: 3), (189: 4), (195: 1), (202: 2), (204: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
