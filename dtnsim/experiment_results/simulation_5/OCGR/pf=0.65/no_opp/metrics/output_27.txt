The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
250(1 to 12), 251(12 to 5), 255(7 to 3), 256(10 to 6), 257(11 to 1), 260(6 to 7), 269(3 to 4), 271(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(250: 2), (251: 1), (255: 1), (256: 5), (257: 2), (260: 1), (269: 2), (271: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
