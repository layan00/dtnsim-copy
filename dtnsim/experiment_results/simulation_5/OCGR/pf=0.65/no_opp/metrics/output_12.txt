The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
275(1 to 12), 276(12 to 5), 278(7 to 3), 279(10 to 6), 280(11 to 1), 283(6 to 7), 289(3 to 4), 291(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(289: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(275: 2), (276: 1), (278: 1), (279: 4), (280: 2), (283: 1), (289: 2), (291: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 275: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
