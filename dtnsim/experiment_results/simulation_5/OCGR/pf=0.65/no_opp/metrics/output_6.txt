The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
163(1 to 12), 164(12 to 5), 167(7 to 3), 168(10 to 6), 169(11 to 1), 177(6 to 7), 186(3 to 4), 187(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(187: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(163: 3), (164: 1), (167: 1), (168: 2), (169: 4), (177: 3), (186: 1), (187: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 163: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
