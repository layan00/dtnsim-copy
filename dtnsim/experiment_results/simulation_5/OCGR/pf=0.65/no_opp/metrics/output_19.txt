The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
449(1 to 12), 450(12 to 5), 452(7 to 3), 453(10 to 6), 454(11 to 1), 458(6 to 7), 462(3 to 4), 463(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(449: 2), (450: 1), (452: 1), (453: 4), (454: 2), (458: 1), (462: 1), (463: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
