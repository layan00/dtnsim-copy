The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
62(1 to 12), 63(12 to 5), 66(7 to 3), 67(10 to 6), 68(11 to 1), 71(6 to 7), 75(3 to 4), 76(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(62: 3), (63: 1), (66: 1), (67: 3), (68: 2), (71: 2), (75: 1), (76: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 62: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 62: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 75: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Bundle 71: (to: 9, time: 30.000000), 
Node 7:

Bundle 76: (to: 4, time: 70.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 76: (to: 5, time: 50.000000), (to: 7, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 71: (to: 12, time: 30.000000), 
Node 10:
