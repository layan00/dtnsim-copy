The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
149(1 to 12), 150(12 to 5), 153(7 to 3), 154(10 to 6), 155(11 to 1), 158(6 to 7), 163(3 to 4), 165(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(153: 45.000000), (165: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(149: 4), (150: 1), (153: 3), (154: 2), (155: 2), (158: 1), (163: 1), (165: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 149: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2:
