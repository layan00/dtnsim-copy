The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
346(1 to 12), 347(12 to 5), 348(7 to 3), 349(10 to 6), 350(11 to 1), 353(6 to 7), 363(3 to 4), 368(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(346: 2), (347: 1), (348: 3), (349: 4), (350: 5), (353: 2), (363: 2), (368: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
