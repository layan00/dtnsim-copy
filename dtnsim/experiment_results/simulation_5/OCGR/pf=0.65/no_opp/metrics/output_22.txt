The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
287(1 to 12), 288(12 to 5), 290(7 to 3), 291(10 to 6), 292(11 to 1), 296(6 to 7), 306(3 to 4), 308(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(287: 80.000000), (306: 10.000000), (308: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(287: 4), (288: 1), (290: 1), (291: 3), (292: 2), (296: 2), (306: 2), (308: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 287: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000),
