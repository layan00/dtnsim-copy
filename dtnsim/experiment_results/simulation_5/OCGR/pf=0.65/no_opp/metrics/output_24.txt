The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
493(1 to 12), 494(12 to 5), 496(7 to 3), 497(10 to 6), 498(11 to 1), 503(6 to 7), 507(3 to 4), 508(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(493: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(493: 5), (494: 1), (496: 1), (497: 2), (498: 2), (503: 1), (507: 1), (508: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 493: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
