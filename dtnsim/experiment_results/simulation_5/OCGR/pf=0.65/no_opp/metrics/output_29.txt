The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
455(1 to 12), 456(12 to 5), 462(7 to 3), 463(10 to 6), 464(11 to 1), 472(6 to 7), 481(3 to 4), 482(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(455: 30.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(455: 5), (456: 1), (462: 1), (463: 4), (464: 2), (472: 3), (481: 1), (482: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
