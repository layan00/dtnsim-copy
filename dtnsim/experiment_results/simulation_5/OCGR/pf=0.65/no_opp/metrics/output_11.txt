The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
170(1 to 12), 171(12 to 5), 174(7 to 3), 175(10 to 6), 176(11 to 1), 180(6 to 7), 192(3 to 4), 194(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(192: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(170: 2), (171: 2), (174: 1), (175: 2), (176: 2), (180: 2), (192: 2), (194: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 170: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 192: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 192: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Bundle 194: (to: 1, time: 50.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 180: (to: 9, time: 30.000000), 
Node 7: 
Bundle 174: (to: 2, time: 50.000000), 
Node 8: 
Bundle 194: (to: 5, time: 50.000000), 
Node 9: 
Bundle 180: (to: 12, time: 30.000000), 
Node 10:
