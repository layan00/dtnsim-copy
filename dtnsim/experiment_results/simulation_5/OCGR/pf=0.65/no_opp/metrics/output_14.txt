The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
484(1 to 12), 485(12 to 5), 487(7 to 3), 488(10 to 6), 489(11 to 1), 494(6 to 7), 504(3 to 4), 506(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(488: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(484: 4), (485: 4), (487: 1), (488: 6), (489: 4), (494: 2), (504: 2), (506: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
