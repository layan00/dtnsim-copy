The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
616(1 to 12), 617(12 to 5), 632(7 to 3), 633(10 to 6), 634(11 to 1), 642(6 to 7), 675(3 to 4), 678(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(678: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(616: 3), (617: 1), (632: 1), (633: 5), (634: 5), (642: 3), (675: 1), (678: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
