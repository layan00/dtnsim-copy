The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1458(1 to 12), 1459(12 to 5), 1478(7 to 3), 1479(10 to 6), 1480(11 to 1), 1484(6 to 7), 1510(3 to 4), 1511(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1458: 80.000000), (1479: 65.000000), (1511: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1458: 4), (1459: 6), (1478: 1), (1479: 4), (1480: 3), (1484: 1), (1510: 1), (1511: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
