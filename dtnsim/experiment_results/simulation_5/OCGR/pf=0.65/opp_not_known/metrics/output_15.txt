The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(1 to 12), 216(12 to 5), 231(7 to 3), 232(10 to 6), 233(11 to 1), 235(6 to 7), 273(3 to 4), 274(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 80.000000), (233: 15.000000), (274: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 5), (216: 1), (231: 1), (232: 4), (233: 4), (235: 5), (273: 1), (274: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
