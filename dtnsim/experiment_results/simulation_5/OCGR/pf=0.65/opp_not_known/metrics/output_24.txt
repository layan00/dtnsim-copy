The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1862(1 to 12), 1863(12 to 5), 1880(7 to 3), 1881(10 to 6), 1882(11 to 1), 1887(6 to 7), 1915(3 to 4), 1921(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1862: 80.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1862: 5), (1863: 6), (1880: 1), (1881: 6), (1882: 5), (1887: 1), (1915: 1), (1921: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 48 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
