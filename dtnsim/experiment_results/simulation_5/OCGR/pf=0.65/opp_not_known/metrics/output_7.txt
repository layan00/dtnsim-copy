The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1019(1 to 12), 1020(12 to 5), 1037(7 to 3), 1038(10 to 6), 1039(11 to 1), 1046(6 to 7), 1077(3 to 4), 1082(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1019: 4), (1020: 1), (1037: 3), (1038: 5), (1039: 5), (1046: 1), (1077: 1), (1082: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
