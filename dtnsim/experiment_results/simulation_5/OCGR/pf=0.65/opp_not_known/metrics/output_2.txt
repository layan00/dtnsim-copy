The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1016(1 to 12), 1017(12 to 5), 1036(7 to 3), 1037(10 to 6), 1038(11 to 1), 1043(6 to 7), 1069(3 to 4), 1074(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1016: 4), (1017: 6), (1036: 1), (1037: 5), (1038: 3), (1043: 1), (1069: 2), (1074: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
