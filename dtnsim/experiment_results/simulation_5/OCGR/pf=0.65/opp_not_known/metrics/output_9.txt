The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1820(1 to 12), 1821(12 to 5), 1837(7 to 3), 1838(10 to 6), 1839(11 to 1), 1844(6 to 7), 1881(3 to 4), 1883(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1820: 80.000000), (1821: 40.000000), (1839: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1820: 4), (1821: 3), (1837: 1), (1838: 5), (1839: 4), (1844: 1), (1881: 1), (1883: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
