The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(1 to 12), 207(12 to 5), 222(7 to 3), 223(10 to 6), 224(11 to 1), 227(6 to 7), 257(3 to 4), 260(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(260: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 3), (207: 1), (222: 1), (223: 3), (224: 5), (227: 5), (257: 1), (260: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 206: (to: 2, time: 0.000000),
