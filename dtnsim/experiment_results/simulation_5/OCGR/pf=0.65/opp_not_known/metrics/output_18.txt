The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1411(1 to 12), 1412(12 to 5), 1427(7 to 3), 1428(10 to 6), 1429(11 to 1), 1434(6 to 7), 1464(3 to 4), 1468(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1411: 80.000000), (1427: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1411: 5), (1412: 1), (1427: 3), (1428: 3), (1429: 5), (1434: 3), (1464: 1), (1468: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
