The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1811(1 to 12), 1812(12 to 5), 1828(7 to 3), 1829(10 to 6), 1830(11 to 1), 1834(6 to 7), 1862(3 to 4), 1866(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1830: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1811: 4), (1812: 1), (1828: 1), (1829: 4), (1830: 5), (1834: 1), (1862: 1), (1866: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
