The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1868(1 to 12), 1869(12 to 5), 1885(7 to 3), 1886(10 to 6), 1887(11 to 1), 1892(6 to 7), 1931(3 to 4), 1934(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1869: 40.000000), (1886: 65.000000), (1887: 15.000000), (1934: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1868: 4), (1869: 3), (1885: 1), (1886: 6), (1887: 4), (1892: 6), (1931: 2), (1934: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
