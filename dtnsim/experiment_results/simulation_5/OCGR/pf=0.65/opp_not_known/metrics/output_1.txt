The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
618(1 to 12), 619(12 to 5), 635(7 to 3), 636(10 to 6), 637(11 to 1), 642(6 to 7), 674(3 to 4), 676(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(674: 10.000000), (676: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(618: 4), (619: 1), (635: 1), (636: 3), (637: 3), (642: 3), (674: 2), (676: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
