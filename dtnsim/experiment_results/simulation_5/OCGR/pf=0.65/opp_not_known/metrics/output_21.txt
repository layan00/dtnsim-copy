The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
635(1 to 12), 636(12 to 5), 653(7 to 3), 654(10 to 6), 655(11 to 1), 661(6 to 7), 694(3 to 4), 696(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(636: 40.000000), (694: 10.000000), (696: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(635: 4), (636: 3), (653: 1), (654: 3), (655: 4), (661: 1), (694: 2), (696: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
