The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
599(1 to 12), 600(12 to 5), 617(7 to 3), 618(10 to 6), 619(11 to 1), 622(6 to 7), 651(3 to 4), 657(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(617: 45.000000), (657: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(599: 4), (600: 1), (617: 3), (618: 5), (619: 5), (622: 1), (651: 1), (657: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
