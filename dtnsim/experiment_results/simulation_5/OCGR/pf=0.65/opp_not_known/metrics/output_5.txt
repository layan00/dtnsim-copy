The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(1 to 12), 211(12 to 5), 229(7 to 3), 230(10 to 6), 231(11 to 1), 235(6 to 7), 272(3 to 4), 275(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(231: 15.000000), (272: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 4), (211: 6), (229: 1), (230: 4), (231: 4), (235: 3), (272: 2), (275: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
