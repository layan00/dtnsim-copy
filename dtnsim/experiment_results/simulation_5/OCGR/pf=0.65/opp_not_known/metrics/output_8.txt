The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1420(1 to 12), 1421(12 to 5), 1439(7 to 3), 1440(10 to 6), 1441(11 to 1), 1444(6 to 7), 1476(3 to 4), 1479(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1421: 70.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1420: 4), (1421: 7), (1439: 1), (1440: 4), (1441: 5), (1444: 5), (1476: 1), (1479: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 49 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
