The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1042(1 to 12), 1043(12 to 5), 1062(7 to 3), 1063(10 to 6), 1064(11 to 1), 1067(6 to 7), 1097(3 to 4), 1102(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1042: 80.000000), (1097: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1042: 4), (1043: 6), (1062: 1), (1063: 4), (1064: 5), (1067: 1), (1097: 2), (1102: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
