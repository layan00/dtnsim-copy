The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
619(1 to 12), 620(12 to 5), 635(7 to 3), 636(10 to 6), 637(11 to 1), 639(6 to 7), 672(3 to 4), 676(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(619: 80.000000), (637: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(619: 4), (620: 1), (635: 1), (636: 3), (637: 5), (639: 5), (672: 1), (676: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
