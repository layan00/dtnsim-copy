The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(1 to 12), 215(12 to 5), 233(7 to 3), 234(10 to 6), 235(11 to 1), 240(6 to 7), 270(3 to 4), 274(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(270: 10.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 4), (215: 1), (233: 1), (234: 6), (235: 5), (240: 1), (270: 2), (274: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
