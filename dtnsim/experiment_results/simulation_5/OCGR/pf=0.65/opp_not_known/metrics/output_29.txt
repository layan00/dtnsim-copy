The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1824(1 to 12), 1825(12 to 5), 1843(7 to 3), 1844(10 to 6), 1845(11 to 1), 1853(6 to 7), 1886(3 to 4), 1889(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1824: 30.000000), (1889: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1824: 5), (1825: 1), (1843: 1), (1844: 4), (1845: 5), (1853: 3), (1886: 1), (1889: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
