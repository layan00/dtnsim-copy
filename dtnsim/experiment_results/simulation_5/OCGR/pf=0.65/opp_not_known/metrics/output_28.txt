The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1416(1 to 12), 1417(12 to 5), 1436(7 to 3), 1437(10 to 6), 1438(11 to 1), 1445(6 to 7), 1478(3 to 4), 1480(8 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1417: 30.000000), (1437: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1416: 3), (1417: 4), (1436: 3), (1437: 4), (1438: 3), (1445: 1), (1478: 1), (1480: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
