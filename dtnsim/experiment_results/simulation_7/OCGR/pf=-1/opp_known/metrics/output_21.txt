The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
530(2 to 10), 531(8 to 3), 538(3 to 11), 539(12 to 10), 545(10 to 5), 571(11 to 6), 575(1 to 9), 587(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(530: 55.000000), (531: 25.000000), (538: 45.000000), (539: 45.000000), (545: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(530: 4), (531: 7), (538: 6), (539: 4), (545: 4), (571: 4), (575: 2), (587: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
