The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
532(2 to 10), 533(8 to 3), 538(3 to 11), 539(12 to 10), 546(10 to 5), 566(11 to 6), 573(1 to 9), 587(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(532: 35.000000), (539: 45.000000), (546: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(532: 2), (533: 2), (538: 6), (539: 4), (546: 4), (566: 3), (573: 5), (587: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
