The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
523(2 to 10), 524(8 to 3), 529(3 to 11), 530(12 to 10), 536(10 to 5), 558(11 to 6), 561(1 to 9), 578(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(523: 55.000000), (536: 35.000000), (561: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(523: 4), (524: 2), (529: 6), (530: 3), (536: 4), (558: 4), (561: 4), (578: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
