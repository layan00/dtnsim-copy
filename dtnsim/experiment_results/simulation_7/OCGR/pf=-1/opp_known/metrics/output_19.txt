The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1445(2 to 10), 1446(8 to 3), 1450(3 to 11), 1451(12 to 10), 1456(10 to 5), 1476(11 to 6), 1480(1 to 9), 1485(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1450: 75.000000), (1480: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1445: 2), (1446: 2), (1450: 9), (1451: 4), (1456: 2), (1476: 4), (1480: 3), (1485: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
