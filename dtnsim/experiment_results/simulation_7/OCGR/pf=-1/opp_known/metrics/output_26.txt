The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
517(2 to 10), 518(8 to 3), 523(3 to 11), 524(12 to 10), 529(10 to 5), 549(11 to 6), 552(1 to 9), 565(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(517: 55.000000), (523: 35.000000), (552: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(517: 4), (518: 2), (523: 4), (524: 3), (529: 2), (549: 4), (552: 5), (565: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
