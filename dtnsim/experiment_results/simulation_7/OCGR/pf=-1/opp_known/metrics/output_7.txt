The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
843(2 to 10), 844(8 to 3), 851(3 to 11), 852(12 to 10), 861(10 to 5), 884(11 to 6), 888(1 to 9), 899(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(844: 25.000000), (851: 45.000000), (861: 35.000000), (888: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(843: 2), (844: 7), (851: 6), (852: 3), (861: 4), (884: 4), (888: 3), (899: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
