The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1464(2 to 10), 1465(8 to 3), 1471(3 to 11), 1472(12 to 10), 1479(10 to 5), 1499(11 to 6), 1504(1 to 9), 1517(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1471: 35.000000), (1479: 35.000000), (1504: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1464: 2), (1465: 2), (1471: 4), (1472: 3), (1479: 4), (1499: 4), (1504: 4), (1517: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
