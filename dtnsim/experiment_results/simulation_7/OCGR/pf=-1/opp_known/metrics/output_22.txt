The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
841(2 to 10), 842(8 to 3), 846(3 to 11), 847(12 to 10), 852(10 to 5), 873(11 to 6), 876(1 to 9), 888(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(841: 55.000000), (873: 35.000000), (876: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(841: 4), (842: 2), (846: 6), (847: 3), (852: 2), (873: 5), (876: 5), (888: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
