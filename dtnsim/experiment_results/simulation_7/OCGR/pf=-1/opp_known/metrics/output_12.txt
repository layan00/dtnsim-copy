The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
835(2 to 10), 836(8 to 3), 840(3 to 11), 841(12 to 10), 847(10 to 5), 865(11 to 6), 872(1 to 9), 884(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(835: 35.000000), (847: 35.000000), (872: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(835: 2), (836: 2), (840: 2), (841: 4), (847: 4), (865: 4), (872: 5), (884: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
