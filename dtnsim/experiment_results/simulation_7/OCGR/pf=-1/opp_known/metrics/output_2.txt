The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
843(2 to 10), 844(8 to 3), 848(3 to 11), 849(12 to 10), 855(10 to 5), 877(11 to 6), 881(1 to 9), 896(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(843: 55.000000), (848: 35.000000), (855: 35.000000), (881: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(843: 4), (844: 2), (848: 4), (849: 3), (855: 4), (877: 4), (881: 5), (896: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
