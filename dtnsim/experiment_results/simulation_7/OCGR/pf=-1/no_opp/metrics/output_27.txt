The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
321(2 to 10), 322(8 to 3), 331(3 to 11), 332(12 to 10), 341(10 to 5), 345(11 to 6), 352(1 to 9), 359(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(321: 35.000000), (322: 5.000000), (345: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(321: 2), (322: 3), (331: 7), (341: 2), (345: 3), (352: 2), (359: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
