The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
339(2 to 10), 340(8 to 3), 347(3 to 11), 348(12 to 10), 358(10 to 5), 362(11 to 6), 366(1 to 9), 377(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(347: 45.000000), (358: 35.000000), (366: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(339: 2), (340: 3), (347: 6), (358: 4), (362: 4), (366: 3), (377: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
