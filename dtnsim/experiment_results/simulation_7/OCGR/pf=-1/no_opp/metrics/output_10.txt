The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
73(2 to 10), 74(8 to 3), 81(3 to 11), 82(12 to 10), 90(10 to 5), 95(11 to 6), 97(1 to 9), 102(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(73: 1), (74: 3), (81: 8), (90: 4), (95: 3), (97: 2), (102: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
