The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
593(2 to 10), 594(8 to 3), 599(3 to 11), 600(12 to 10), 605(10 to 5), 609(11 to 6), 613(1 to 9), 619(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(593: 1), (594: 3), (599: 3), (605: 7), (609: 4), (613: 2), (619: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
