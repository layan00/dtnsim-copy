The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
572(2 to 10), 573(8 to 3), 579(3 to 11), 580(12 to 10), 589(10 to 5), 593(11 to 6), 598(1 to 9), 608(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(579: 35.000000), (589: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 2), (573: 2), (579: 4), (589: 4), (593: 4), (598: 2), (608: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
