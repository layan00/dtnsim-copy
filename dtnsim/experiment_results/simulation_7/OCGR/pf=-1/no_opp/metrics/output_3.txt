The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
457(2 to 10), 458(8 to 3), 464(3 to 11), 465(12 to 10), 473(10 to 5), 477(11 to 6), 482(1 to 9), 489(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(464: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(457: 2), (458: 2), (464: 5), (473: 7), (477: 4), (482: 2), (489: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
