The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
318(2 to 10), 319(8 to 3), 324(3 to 11), 325(12 to 10), 330(10 to 5), 332(11 to 6), 335(1 to 9), 344(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(335: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(318: 1), (319: 2), (324: 6), (330: 2), (332: 6), (335: 4), (344: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
