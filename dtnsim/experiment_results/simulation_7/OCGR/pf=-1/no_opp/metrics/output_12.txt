The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
316(2 to 10), 317(8 to 3), 321(3 to 11), 322(12 to 10), 328(10 to 5), 332(11 to 6), 338(1 to 9), 349(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(316: 35.000000), (328: 35.000000), (338: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(316: 2), (317: 2), (321: 2), (328: 4), (332: 4), (338: 4), (349: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
