The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
210(2 to 10), 211(8 to 3), 216(3 to 11), 217(12 to 10), 224(10 to 5), 228(11 to 6), 231(1 to 9), 243(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(216: 35.000000), (224: 35.000000), (228: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(210: 1), (211: 2), (216: 4), (224: 4), (228: 5), (231: 2), (243: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
