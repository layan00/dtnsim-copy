The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
455(2 to 10), 456(8 to 3), 463(3 to 11), 464(12 to 10), 473(10 to 5), 476(11 to 6), 480(1 to 9), 495(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(463: 35.000000), (495: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(455: 2), (456: 3), (463: 4), (473: 5), (476: 4), (480: 3), (495: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
