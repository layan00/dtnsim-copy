The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
443(2 to 10), 444(8 to 3), 449(3 to 11), 450(12 to 10), 458(10 to 5), 463(11 to 6), 467(1 to 9), 479(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(463: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(443: 1), (444: 2), (449: 6), (458: 4), (463: 4), (467: 2), (479: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
