The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
436(2 to 10), 437(8 to 3), 444(3 to 11), 445(12 to 10), 451(10 to 5), 457(11 to 6), 462(1 to 9), 472(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(451: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(436: 1), (437: 3), (444: 6), (451: 5), (457: 3), (462: 4), (472: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
