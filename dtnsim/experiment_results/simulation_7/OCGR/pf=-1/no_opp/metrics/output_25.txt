The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
76(2 to 10), 77(8 to 3), 82(3 to 11), 83(12 to 10), 90(10 to 5), 94(11 to 6), 97(1 to 9), 107(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(90: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(76: 1), (77: 2), (82: 6), (90: 4), (94: 4), (97: 2), (107: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
