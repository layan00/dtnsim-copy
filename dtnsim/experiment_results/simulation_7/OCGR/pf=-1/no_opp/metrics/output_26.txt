The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
197(2 to 10), 198(8 to 3), 203(3 to 11), 204(12 to 10), 211(10 to 5), 213(11 to 6), 216(1 to 9), 226(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(197: 1), (198: 2), (203: 4), (211: 2), (213: 4), (216: 2), (226: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
