The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
587(2 to 10), 588(8 to 3), 593(3 to 11), 594(12 to 10), 602(10 to 5), 606(11 to 6), 609(1 to 9), 617(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(593: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(587: 2), (588: 2), (593: 5), (602: 7), (606: 4), (609: 2), (617: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
