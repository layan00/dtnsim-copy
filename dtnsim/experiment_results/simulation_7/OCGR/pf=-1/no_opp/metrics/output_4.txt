The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
579(2 to 10), 580(8 to 3), 585(3 to 11), 586(12 to 10), 592(10 to 5), 596(11 to 6), 600(1 to 9), 610(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(585: 75.000000), (592: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(579: 1), (580: 2), (585: 5), (592: 4), (596: 3), (600: 4), (610: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
