The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
192(2 to 10), 193(8 to 3), 198(3 to 11), 199(12 to 10), 207(10 to 5), 211(11 to 6), 214(1 to 9), 227(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(192: 1), (193: 2), (198: 6), (207: 4), (211: 4), (214: 2), (227: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
