The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(2 to 10), 212(8 to 3), 219(3 to 11), 220(12 to 10), 227(10 to 5), 232(11 to 6), 235(1 to 9), 245(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 45.000000), (227: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(211: 1), (212: 3), (219: 6), (227: 4), (232: 4), (235: 2), (245: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
