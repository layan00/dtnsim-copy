The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(2 to 10), 82(8 to 3), 86(3 to 11), 87(12 to 10), 96(10 to 5), 102(11 to 6), 107(1 to 9), 116(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 2), (82: 2), (86: 6), (96: 4), (102: 4), (107: 2), (116: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
