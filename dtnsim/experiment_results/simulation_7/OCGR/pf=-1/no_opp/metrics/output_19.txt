The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
557(2 to 10), 558(8 to 3), 562(3 to 11), 563(12 to 10), 570(10 to 5), 574(11 to 6), 577(1 to 9), 582(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(562: 75.000000), (577: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(557: 2), (558: 2), (562: 8), (570: 2), (574: 4), (577: 3), (582: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
