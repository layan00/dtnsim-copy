The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
572(2 to 10), 573(8 to 3), 578(3 to 11), 579(12 to 10), 586(10 to 5), 595(11 to 6), 600(1 to 9), 605(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(573: 25.000000), (586: 5.000000), (595: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(572: 1), (573: 4), (578: 4), (586: 3), (595: 5), (600: 2), (605: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
