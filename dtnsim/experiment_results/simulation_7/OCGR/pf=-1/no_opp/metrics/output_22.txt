The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
331(2 to 10), 332(8 to 3), 336(3 to 11), 337(12 to 10), 344(10 to 5), 347(11 to 6), 350(1 to 9), 359(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(347: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(331: 1), (332: 2), (336: 6), (344: 2), (347: 5), (350: 2), (359: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
