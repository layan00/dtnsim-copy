The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(2 to 10), 81(8 to 3), 83(3 to 11), 84(12 to 10), 91(10 to 5), 95(11 to 6), 101(1 to 9), 112(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 35.000000), (83: 75.000000), (91: 35.000000), (95: 35.000000), (101: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 2), (81: 2), (83: 4), (91: 4), (95: 5), (101: 4), (112: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
