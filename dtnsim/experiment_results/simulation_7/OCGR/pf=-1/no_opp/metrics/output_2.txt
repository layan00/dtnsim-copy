The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
336(2 to 10), 337(8 to 3), 341(3 to 11), 342(12 to 10), 350(10 to 5), 354(11 to 6), 358(1 to 9), 370(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(341: 35.000000), (350: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(336: 1), (337: 2), (341: 4), (350: 4), (354: 4), (358: 2), (370: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
