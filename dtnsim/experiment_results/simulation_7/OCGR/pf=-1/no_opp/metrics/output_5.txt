The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
78(2 to 10), 79(8 to 3), 83(3 to 11), 84(12 to 10), 93(10 to 5), 97(11 to 6), 105(1 to 9), 115(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(83: 75.000000), (93: 35.000000), (97: 15.000000), (105: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 2), (79: 2), (83: 10), (93: 4), (97: 3), (105: 4), (115: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
