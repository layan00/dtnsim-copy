The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
449(2 to 10), 450(8 to 3), 457(3 to 11), 458(12 to 10), 466(10 to 5), 472(11 to 6), 477(1 to 9), 489(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(457: 45.000000), (466: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(449: 1), (450: 3), (457: 6), (466: 5), (472: 4), (477: 3), (489: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
