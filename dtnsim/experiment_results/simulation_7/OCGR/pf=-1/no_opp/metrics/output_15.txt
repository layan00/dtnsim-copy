The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
77(2 to 10), 78(8 to 3), 83(3 to 11), 84(12 to 10), 90(10 to 5), 95(11 to 6), 100(1 to 9), 108(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(83: 75.000000), (95: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(77: 1), (78: 2), (83: 5), (90: 5), (95: 5), (100: 2), (108: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
