The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1956(2 to 10), 1957(8 to 3), 1975(3 to 11), 1976(12 to 10), 1985(10 to 5), 2015(11 to 6), 2020(1 to 9), 2045(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1975: 35.000000), (1985: 35.000000), (2020: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1956: 2), (1957: 2), (1975: 4), (1976: 3), (1985: 4), (2015: 4), (2020: 4), (2045: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
