The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(2 to 10), 226(8 to 3), 242(3 to 11), 243(12 to 10), 252(10 to 5), 284(11 to 6), 289(1 to 9), 313(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(252: 85.000000), (289: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 2), (226: 2), (242: 6), (243: 3), (252: 11), (284: 4), (289: 4), (313: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 46 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
