The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1959(2 to 10), 1960(8 to 3), 1977(3 to 11), 1978(12 to 10), 1983(10 to 5), 2017(11 to 6), 2021(1 to 9), 2041(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1959: 55.000000), (1977: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1959: 4), (1960: 3), (1977: 6), (1978: 3), (1983: 7), (2017: 4), (2021: 2), (2041: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
