The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1080(2 to 10), 1081(8 to 3), 1098(3 to 11), 1099(12 to 10), 1104(10 to 5), 1134(11 to 6), 1140(1 to 9), 1163(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1080: 55.000000), (1099: 45.000000), (1134: 35.000000), (1140: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1080: 4), (1081: 2), (1098: 6), (1099: 4), (1104: 2), (1134: 4), (1140: 5), (1163: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
