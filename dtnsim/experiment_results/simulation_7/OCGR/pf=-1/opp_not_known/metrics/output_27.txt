The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1081(2 to 10), 1082(8 to 3), 1103(3 to 11), 1104(12 to 10), 1113(10 to 5), 1143(11 to 6), 1150(1 to 9), 1172(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1081: 35.000000), (1082: 5.000000), (1143: 15.000000), (1150: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1081: 2), (1082: 3), (1103: 7), (1104: 3), (1113: 2), (1143: 3), (1150: 4), (1172: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
