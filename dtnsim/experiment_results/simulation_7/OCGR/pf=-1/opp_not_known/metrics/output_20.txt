The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(2 to 10), 225(8 to 3), 239(3 to 11), 240(12 to 10), 247(10 to 5), 280(11 to 6), 287(1 to 9), 312(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 35.000000), (225: 25.000000), (239: 75.000000), (240: 45.000000), (247: 35.000000), (280: 35.000000), (287: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 2), (225: 5), (239: 4), (240: 4), (247: 4), (280: 5), (287: 5), (312: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
