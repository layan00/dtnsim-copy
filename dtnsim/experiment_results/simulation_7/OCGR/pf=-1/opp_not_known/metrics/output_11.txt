The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
655(2 to 10), 656(8 to 3), 673(3 to 11), 674(12 to 10), 682(10 to 5), 714(11 to 6), 719(1 to 9), 746(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(655: 55.000000), (682: 35.000000), (719: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(655: 4), (656: 2), (673: 6), (674: 3), (682: 4), (714: 4), (719: 4), (746: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
