The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
649(2 to 10), 650(8 to 3), 667(3 to 11), 668(12 to 10), 675(10 to 5), 705(11 to 6), 708(1 to 9), 733(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(649: 55.000000), (667: 35.000000), (708: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(649: 4), (650: 2), (667: 4), (668: 3), (675: 2), (705: 4), (708: 5), (733: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
