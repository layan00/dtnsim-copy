The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(2 to 10), 665(8 to 3), 682(3 to 11), 683(12 to 10), 692(10 to 5), 722(11 to 6), 729(1 to 9), 755(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(664: 35.000000), (683: 45.000000), (692: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(664: 2), (665: 2), (682: 6), (683: 4), (692: 4), (722: 3), (729: 5), (755: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
