The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
651(2 to 10), 652(8 to 3), 669(3 to 11), 670(12 to 10), 677(10 to 5), 709(11 to 6), 714(1 to 9), 737(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(651: 55.000000), (670: 45.000000), (677: 85.000000), (714: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(651: 4), (652: 2), (669: 6), (670: 4), (677: 10), (709: 4), (714: 5), (737: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
