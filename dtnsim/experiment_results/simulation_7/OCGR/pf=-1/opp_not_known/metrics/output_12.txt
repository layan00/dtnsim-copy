The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1087(2 to 10), 1088(8 to 3), 1104(3 to 11), 1105(12 to 10), 1111(10 to 5), 1141(11 to 6), 1148(1 to 9), 1172(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1087: 35.000000), (1111: 35.000000), (1148: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1087: 2), (1088: 2), (1104: 2), (1105: 4), (1111: 4), (1141: 4), (1148: 5), (1172: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
