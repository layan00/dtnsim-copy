The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1970(2 to 10), 1971(8 to 3), 1988(3 to 11), 1989(12 to 10), 1997(10 to 5), 2027(11 to 6), 2030(1 to 9), 2052(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1988: 75.000000), (1997: 85.000000), (2030: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1970: 2), (1971: 2), (1988: 5), (1989: 3), (1997: 10), (2027: 4), (2030: 5), (2052: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 43 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
