The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1937(2 to 10), 1938(8 to 3), 1954(3 to 11), 1955(12 to 10), 1962(10 to 5), 1992(11 to 6), 1996(1 to 9), 2013(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1954: 75.000000), (1996: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1937: 2), (1938: 2), (1954: 9), (1955: 4), (1962: 2), (1992: 4), (1996: 3), (2013: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
