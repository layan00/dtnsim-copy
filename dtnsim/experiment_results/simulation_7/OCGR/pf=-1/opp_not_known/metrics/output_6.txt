The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
659(2 to 10), 660(8 to 3), 677(3 to 11), 678(12 to 10), 685(10 to 5), 717(11 to 6), 720(1 to 9), 747(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(659: 55.000000), (677: 35.000000), (685: 35.000000), (717: 35.000000), (720: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(659: 4), (660: 2), (677: 4), (678: 3), (685: 4), (717: 5), (720: 5), (747: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
