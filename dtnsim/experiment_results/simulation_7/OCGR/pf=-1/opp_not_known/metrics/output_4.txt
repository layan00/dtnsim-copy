The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1951(2 to 10), 1952(8 to 3), 1969(3 to 11), 1970(12 to 10), 1976(10 to 5), 2008(11 to 6), 2013(1 to 9), 2038(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1951: 55.000000), (1969: 75.000000), (1970: 45.000000), (1976: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1951: 4), (1952: 2), (1969: 5), (1970: 4), (1976: 4), (2008: 3), (2013: 5), (2038: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
