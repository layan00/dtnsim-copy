The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(2 to 10), 223(8 to 3), 239(3 to 11), 240(12 to 10), 249(10 to 5), 279(11 to 6), 288(1 to 9), 312(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(239: 55.000000), (249: 35.000000), (279: 15.000000), (288: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 2), (223: 2), (239: 12), (240: 4), (249: 4), (279: 3), (288: 4), (312: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
