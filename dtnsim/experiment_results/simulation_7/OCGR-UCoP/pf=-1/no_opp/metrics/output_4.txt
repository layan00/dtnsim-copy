The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
589(2 to 10), 590(8 to 3), 595(3 to 11), 596(12 to 10), 603(10 to 5), 608(11 to 6), 611(1 to 9), 620(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(590: 25.000000), (595: 75.000000), (603: 35.000000), (608: 35.000000), (611: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(589: 1), (590: 3), (595: 5), (603: 2), (608: 3), (611: 2), (620: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
