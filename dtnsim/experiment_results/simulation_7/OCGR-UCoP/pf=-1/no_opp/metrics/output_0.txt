The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(2 to 10), 82(8 to 3), 86(3 to 11), 87(12 to 10), 96(10 to 5), 100(11 to 6), 103(1 to 9), 114(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 55.000000), (86: 75.000000), (100: 35.000000), (103: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 3), (82: 1), (86: 7), (96: 2), (100: 3), (103: 2), (114: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 9 calls to RUCoP, which took 65 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
