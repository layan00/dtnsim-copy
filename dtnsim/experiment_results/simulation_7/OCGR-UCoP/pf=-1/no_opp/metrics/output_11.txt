The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(2 to 10), 197(8 to 3), 202(3 to 11), 203(12 to 10), 212(10 to 5), 217(11 to 6), 220(1 to 9), 231(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(197: 25.000000), (202: 75.000000), (212: 35.000000), (220: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 1), (197: 3), (202: 7), (212: 2), (217: 3), (220: 2), (231: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
