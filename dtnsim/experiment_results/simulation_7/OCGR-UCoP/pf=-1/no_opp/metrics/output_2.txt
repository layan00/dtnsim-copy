The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
342(2 to 10), 343(8 to 3), 346(3 to 11), 347(12 to 10), 355(10 to 5), 359(11 to 6), 362(1 to 9), 374(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(346: 35.000000), (355: 35.000000), (359: 35.000000), (362: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(342: 1), (343: 1), (346: 4), (355: 2), (359: 3), (362: 2), (374: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 17 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
