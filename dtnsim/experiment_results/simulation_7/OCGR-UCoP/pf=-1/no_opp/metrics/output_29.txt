The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
582(2 to 10), 583(8 to 3), 588(3 to 11), 589(12 to 10), 596(10 to 5), 603(11 to 6), 606(1 to 9), 611(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(583: 25.000000), (596: 35.000000), (606: 35.000000), (611: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(582: 1), (583: 3), (588: 4), (596: 2), (603: 2), (606: 2), (611: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
