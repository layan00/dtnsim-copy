The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
592(2 to 10), 593(8 to 3), 596(3 to 11), 597(12 to 10), 602(10 to 5), 606(11 to 6), 608(1 to 9), 614(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(592: 1), (593: 1), (596: 3), (602: 5), (606: 5), (608: 1), (614: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
