The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
560(2 to 10), 561(8 to 3), 564(3 to 11), 565(12 to 10), 572(10 to 5), 576(11 to 6), 578(1 to 9), 586(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(564: 75.000000), (576: 35.000000), (578: 35.000000), (586: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(560: 2), (561: 1), (564: 7), (572: 2), (576: 3), (578: 2), (586: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
