The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
320(2 to 10), 321(8 to 3), 326(3 to 11), 327(12 to 10), 332(10 to 5), 334(11 to 6), 337(1 to 9), 343(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(326: 75.000000), (337: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(320: 1), (321: 2), (326: 8), (332: 2), (334: 5), (337: 2), (343: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
