The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
468(2 to 10), 469(8 to 3), 474(3 to 11), 475(12 to 10), 484(10 to 5), 489(11 to 6), 493(1 to 9), 501(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(469: 25.000000), (484: 35.000000), (489: 35.000000), (493: 35.000000), (501: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(468: 2), (469: 3), (474: 5), (484: 2), (489: 3), (493: 2), (501: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
