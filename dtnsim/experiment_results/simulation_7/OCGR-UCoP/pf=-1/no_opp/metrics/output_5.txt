The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
78(2 to 10), 79(8 to 3), 83(3 to 11), 84(12 to 10), 94(10 to 5), 99(11 to 6), 103(1 to 9), 111(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(79: 25.000000), (94: 35.000000), (99: 35.000000), (111: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(78: 2), (79: 3), (83: 5), (94: 2), (99: 3), (103: 2), (111: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
