The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
333(2 to 10), 334(8 to 3), 340(3 to 11), 341(12 to 10), 352(10 to 5), 357(11 to 6), 359(1 to 9), 370(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(334: 25.000000), (340: 75.000000), (352: 35.000000), (357: 35.000000), (359: 35.000000), (370: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(333: 2), (334: 3), (340: 7), (352: 2), (357: 3), (359: 2), (370: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
