The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
80(2 to 10), 81(8 to 3), 83(3 to 11), 84(12 to 10), 91(10 to 5), 95(11 to 6), 100(1 to 9), 110(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(80: 35.000000), (83: 75.000000), (91: 35.000000), (95: 35.000000), (100: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(80: 2), (81: 1), (83: 4), (91: 2), (95: 3), (100: 2), (110: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
