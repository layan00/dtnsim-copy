The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
454(2 to 10), 455(8 to 3), 461(3 to 11), 462(12 to 10), 472(10 to 5), 477(11 to 6), 480(1 to 9), 494(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(455: 25.000000), (461: 35.000000), (472: 35.000000), (494: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(454: 2), (455: 3), (461: 4), (472: 2), (477: 3), (480: 2), (494: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
