The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
464(2 to 10), 465(8 to 3), 471(3 to 11), 472(12 to 10), 481(10 to 5), 486(11 to 6), 489(1 to 9), 495(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(465: 25.000000), (471: 75.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(464: 2), (465: 3), (471: 5), (481: 5), (486: 5), (489: 2), (495: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
