The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(2 to 10), 209(8 to 3), 215(3 to 11), 216(12 to 10), 223(10 to 5), 228(11 to 6), 230(1 to 9), 240(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 35.000000), (228: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 1), (209: 2), (215: 6), (223: 2), (228: 3), (230: 1), (240: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
