The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
459(2 to 10), 460(8 to 3), 466(3 to 11), 467(12 to 10), 476(10 to 5), 482(11 to 6), 485(1 to 9), 496(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(460: 25.000000), (476: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(459: 1), (460: 3), (466: 6), (476: 2), (482: 3), (485: 2), (496: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
