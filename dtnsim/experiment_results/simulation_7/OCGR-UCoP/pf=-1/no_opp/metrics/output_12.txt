The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
325(2 to 10), 326(8 to 3), 329(3 to 11), 330(12 to 10), 336(10 to 5), 339(11 to 6), 344(1 to 9), 353(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(325: 35.000000), (339: 35.000000), (353: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(325: 2), (326: 1), (329: 2), (336: 2), (339: 3), (344: 1), (353: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
