The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
206(2 to 10), 207(8 to 3), 212(3 to 11), 213(12 to 10), 220(10 to 5), 224(11 to 6), 226(1 to 9), 238(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 35.000000), (220: 35.000000), (224: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(206: 1), (207: 2), (212: 4), (220: 2), (224: 3), (226: 1), (238: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
