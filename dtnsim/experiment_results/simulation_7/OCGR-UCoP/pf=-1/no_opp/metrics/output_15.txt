The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
77(2 to 10), 78(8 to 3), 83(3 to 11), 84(12 to 10), 91(10 to 5), 97(11 to 6), 100(1 to 9), 107(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(78: 25.000000), (83: 75.000000), (100: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(77: 1), (78: 3), (83: 5), (91: 3), (97: 3), (100: 2), (107: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
