The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
446(2 to 10), 447(8 to 3), 452(3 to 11), 453(12 to 10), 462(10 to 5), 467(11 to 6), 471(1 to 9), 483(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(447: 25.000000), (462: 35.000000), (467: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(446: 1), (447: 3), (452: 6), (462: 2), (467: 3), (471: 2), (483: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
