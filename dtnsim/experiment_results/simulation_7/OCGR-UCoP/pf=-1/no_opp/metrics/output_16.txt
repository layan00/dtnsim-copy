The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
199(2 to 10), 200(8 to 3), 205(3 to 11), 206(12 to 10), 213(10 to 5), 217(11 to 6), 220(1 to 9), 225(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(205: 75.000000), (220: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(199: 1), (200: 2), (205: 8), (213: 5), (217: 5), (220: 2), (225: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
