The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
76(2 to 10), 77(8 to 3), 82(3 to 11), 83(12 to 10), 90(10 to 5), 94(11 to 6), 96(1 to 9), 106(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(82: 75.000000), (90: 35.000000), (94: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(76: 1), (77: 2), (82: 7), (90: 2), (94: 3), (96: 1), (106: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
