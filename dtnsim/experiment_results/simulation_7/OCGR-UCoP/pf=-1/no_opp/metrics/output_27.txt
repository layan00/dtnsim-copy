The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
328(2 to 10), 329(8 to 3), 336(3 to 11), 337(12 to 10), 347(10 to 5), 353(11 to 6), 358(1 to 9), 365(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(328: 35.000000), (329: 25.000000), (336: 75.000000), (347: 35.000000), (358: 35.000000), (365: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(328: 2), (329: 3), (336: 7), (347: 2), (353: 2), (358: 2), (365: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
