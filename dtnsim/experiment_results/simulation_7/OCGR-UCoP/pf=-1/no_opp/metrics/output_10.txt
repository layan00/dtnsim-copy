The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
73(2 to 10), 74(8 to 3), 80(3 to 11), 81(12 to 10), 90(10 to 5), 95(11 to 6), 97(1 to 9), 101(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(74: 25.000000), (80: 75.000000), (97: 35.000000), (101: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(73: 1), (74: 3), (80: 8), (90: 5), (95: 2), (97: 2), (101: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
