The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
586(2 to 10), 587(8 to 3), 592(3 to 11), 593(12 to 10), 602(10 to 5), 607(11 to 6), 609(1 to 9), 616(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(587: 25.000000), (592: 75.000000), (609: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(586: 2), (587: 3), (592: 5), (602: 5), (607: 5), (609: 2), (616: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
