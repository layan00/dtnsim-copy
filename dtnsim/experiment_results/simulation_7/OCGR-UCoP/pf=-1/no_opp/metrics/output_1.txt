The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(2 to 10), 214(8 to 3), 219(3 to 11), 220(12 to 10), 230(10 to 5), 234(11 to 6), 239(1 to 9), 249(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 35.000000), (214: 25.000000), (219: 75.000000), (239: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 2), (214: 3), (219: 7), (230: 2), (234: 3), (239: 2), (249: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
