The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
439(2 to 10), 440(8 to 3), 446(3 to 11), 447(12 to 10), 453(10 to 5), 457(11 to 6), 460(1 to 9), 469(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(446: 75.000000), (457: 35.000000), (460: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(439: 1), (440: 2), (446: 7), (453: 2), (457: 3), (460: 2), (469: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
