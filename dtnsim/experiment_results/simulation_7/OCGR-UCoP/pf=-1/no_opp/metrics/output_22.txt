The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
329(2 to 10), 330(8 to 3), 333(3 to 11), 334(12 to 10), 341(10 to 5), 345(11 to 6), 347(1 to 9), 358(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(341: 35.000000), (345: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(329: 1), (330: 1), (333: 6), (341: 2), (345: 3), (347: 2), (358: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
