The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
578(2 to 10), 579(8 to 3), 585(3 to 11), 586(12 to 10), 595(10 to 5), 599(11 to 6), 602(1 to 9), 612(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(585: 35.000000), (595: 35.000000), (599: 35.000000), (602: 35.000000), (612: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(578: 2), (579: 2), (585: 4), (595: 2), (599: 3), (602: 2), (612: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
