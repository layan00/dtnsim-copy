The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
657(2 to 10), 658(8 to 3), 678(3 to 11), 679(12 to 10), 686(10 to 5), 717(11 to 6), 723(1 to 9), 744(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(657: 55.000000), (658: 25.000000), (678: 75.000000), (679: 45.000000), (686: 85.000000), (717: 35.000000), (723: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(657: 3), (658: 3), (678: 8), (679: 5), (686: 8), (717: 3), (723: 5), (744: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 106 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
