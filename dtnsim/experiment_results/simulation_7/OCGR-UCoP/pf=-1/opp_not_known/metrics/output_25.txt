The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(2 to 10), 221(8 to 3), 241(3 to 11), 242(12 to 10), 249(10 to 5), 280(11 to 6), 284(1 to 9), 308(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 55.000000), (221: 25.000000), (241: 75.000000), (249: 35.000000), (280: 35.000000), (284: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 3), (221: 3), (241: 7), (242: 4), (249: 2), (280: 3), (284: 5), (308: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
