The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
662(2 to 10), 663(8 to 3), 684(3 to 11), 685(12 to 10), 692(10 to 5), 727(11 to 6), 731(1 to 9), 754(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(662: 55.000000), (663: 25.000000), (684: 95.000000), (685: 45.000000), (692: 35.000000), (727: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(662: 3), (663: 3), (684: 8), (685: 7), (692: 2), (727: 3), (731: 2), (754: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 97 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
