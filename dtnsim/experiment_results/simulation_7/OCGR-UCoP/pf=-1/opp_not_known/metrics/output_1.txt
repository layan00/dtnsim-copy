The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(2 to 10), 665(8 to 3), 685(3 to 11), 686(12 to 10), 694(10 to 5), 724(11 to 6), 731(1 to 9), 756(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(664: 55.000000), (665: 25.000000), (685: 75.000000), (686: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(664: 3), (665: 3), (685: 7), (686: 5), (694: 2), (724: 3), (731: 5), (756: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 18 calls to RUCoP, which took 112 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
