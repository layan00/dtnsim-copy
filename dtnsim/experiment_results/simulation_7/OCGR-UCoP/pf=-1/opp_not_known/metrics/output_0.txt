The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(2 to 10), 226(8 to 3), 245(3 to 11), 246(12 to 10), 254(10 to 5), 285(11 to 6), 290(1 to 9), 315(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 55.000000), (226: 25.000000), (245: 75.000000), (285: 35.000000), (290: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 3), (226: 3), (245: 7), (246: 4), (254: 2), (285: 3), (290: 4), (315: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 19 calls to RUCoP, which took 123 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
