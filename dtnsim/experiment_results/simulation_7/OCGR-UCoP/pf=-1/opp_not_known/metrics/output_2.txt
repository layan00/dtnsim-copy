The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1099(2 to 10), 1100(8 to 3), 1119(3 to 11), 1120(12 to 10), 1128(10 to 5), 1159(11 to 6), 1164(1 to 9), 1190(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1099: 55.000000), (1100: 25.000000), (1119: 35.000000), (1128: 35.000000), (1159: 35.000000), (1164: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1099: 3), (1100: 3), (1119: 4), (1120: 4), (1128: 2), (1159: 3), (1164: 5), (1190: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 109 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
