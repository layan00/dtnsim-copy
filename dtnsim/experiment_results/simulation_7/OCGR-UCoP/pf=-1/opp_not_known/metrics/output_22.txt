The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1097(2 to 10), 1098(8 to 3), 1117(3 to 11), 1118(12 to 10), 1125(10 to 5), 1156(11 to 6), 1160(1 to 9), 1185(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1097: 55.000000), (1098: 25.000000), (1117: 95.000000), (1125: 35.000000), (1156: 35.000000), (1160: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1097: 3), (1098: 3), (1117: 8), (1118: 4), (1125: 2), (1156: 3), (1160: 5), (1185: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 110 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
