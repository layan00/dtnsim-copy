The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1953(2 to 10), 1954(8 to 3), 1973(3 to 11), 1974(12 to 10), 1980(10 to 5), 2011(11 to 6), 2016(1 to 9), 2034(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1954: 25.000000), (1973: 75.000000), (2011: 35.000000), (2016: 35.000000), (2034: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1953: 3), (1954: 3), (1973: 7), (1974: 5), (1980: 1), (2011: 3), (2016: 2), (2034: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 104 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
