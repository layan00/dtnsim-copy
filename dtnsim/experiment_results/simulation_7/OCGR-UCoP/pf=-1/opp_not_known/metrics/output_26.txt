The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
654(2 to 10), 655(8 to 3), 675(3 to 11), 676(12 to 10), 683(10 to 5), 712(11 to 6), 716(1 to 9), 742(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(654: 55.000000), (675: 35.000000), (683: 35.000000), (712: 35.000000), (716: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(654: 3), (655: 3), (675: 4), (676: 4), (683: 2), (712: 3), (716: 5), (742: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 107 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
