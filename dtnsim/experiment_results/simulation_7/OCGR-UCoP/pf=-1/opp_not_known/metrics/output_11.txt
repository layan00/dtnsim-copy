The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
651(2 to 10), 652(8 to 3), 672(3 to 11), 673(12 to 10), 681(10 to 5), 715(11 to 6), 720(1 to 9), 748(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(651: 55.000000), (652: 25.000000), (672: 75.000000), (673: 45.000000), (681: 35.000000), (720: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(651: 3), (652: 3), (672: 7), (673: 7), (681: 2), (715: 3), (720: 4), (748: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 12 calls to RUCoP, which took 79 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
