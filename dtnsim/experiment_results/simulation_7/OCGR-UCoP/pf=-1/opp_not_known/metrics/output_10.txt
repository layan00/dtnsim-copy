The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(2 to 10), 218(8 to 3), 239(3 to 11), 240(12 to 10), 248(10 to 5), 279(11 to 6), 283(1 to 9), 302(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(218: 25.000000), (239: 75.000000), (248: 85.000000), (283: 25.000000), (302: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 3), (218: 3), (239: 8), (240: 3), (248: 8), (279: 3), (283: 5), (302: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 24 calls to RUCoP, which took 153 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
