The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
224(2 to 10), 225(8 to 3), 243(3 to 11), 244(12 to 10), 250(10 to 5), 281(11 to 6), 288(1 to 9), 313(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(224: 55.000000), (225: 25.000000), (243: 75.000000), (244: 45.000000), (250: 35.000000), (281: 35.000000), (288: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(224: 3), (225: 3), (243: 4), (244: 5), (250: 2), (281: 3), (288: 5), (313: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 68 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
