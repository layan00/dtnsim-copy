The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
222(2 to 10), 223(8 to 3), 242(3 to 11), 243(12 to 10), 251(10 to 5), 282(11 to 6), 289(1 to 9), 311(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(223: 25.000000), (242: 55.000000), (251: 35.000000), (282: 35.000000), (289: 0.000000), (311: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(222: 3), (223: 3), (242: 6), (243: 5), (251: 2), (282: 3), (289: 4), (311: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 109 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
