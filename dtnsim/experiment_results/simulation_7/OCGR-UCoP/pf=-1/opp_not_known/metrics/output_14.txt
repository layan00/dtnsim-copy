The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1965(2 to 10), 1966(8 to 3), 1987(3 to 11), 1988(12 to 10), 1996(10 to 5), 2027(11 to 6), 2032(1 to 9), 2056(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1966: 25.000000), (1987: 35.000000), (1996: 35.000000), (2027: 35.000000), (2032: 0.000000), (2056: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1965: 3), (1966: 3), (1987: 4), (1988: 4), (1996: 2), (2027: 3), (2032: 4), (2056: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 105 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
