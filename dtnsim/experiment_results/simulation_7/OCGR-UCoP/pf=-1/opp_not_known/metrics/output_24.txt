The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1976(2 to 10), 1977(8 to 3), 1997(3 to 11), 1998(12 to 10), 2005(10 to 5), 2036(11 to 6), 2040(1 to 9), 2062(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1976: 55.000000), (1977: 25.000000), (1997: 75.000000), (2005: 85.000000), (2036: 35.000000), (2040: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1976: 3), (1977: 3), (1997: 5), (1998: 4), (2005: 8), (2036: 3), (2040: 5), (2062: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 17 calls to RUCoP, which took 115 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
