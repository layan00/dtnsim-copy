The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(2 to 10), 222(8 to 3), 242(3 to 11), 243(12 to 10), 249(10 to 5), 284(11 to 6), 289(1 to 9), 314(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 55.000000), (222: 25.000000), (242: 75.000000), (243: 45.000000), (284: 35.000000), (289: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 3), (222: 3), (242: 5), (243: 7), (249: 3), (284: 3), (289: 4), (314: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 70 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
