The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1092(2 to 10), 1093(8 to 3), 1112(3 to 11), 1113(12 to 10), 1118(10 to 5), 1148(11 to 6), 1155(1 to 9), 1177(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1093: 25.000000), (1148: 35.000000), (1155: 25.000000), (1177: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1092: 3), (1093: 3), (1112: 2), (1113: 5), (1118: 2), (1148: 3), (1155: 5), (1177: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 15 calls to RUCoP, which took 95 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
