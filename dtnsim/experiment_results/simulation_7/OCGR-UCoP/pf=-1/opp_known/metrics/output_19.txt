The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1453(2 to 10), 1454(8 to 3), 1461(3 to 11), 1462(12 to 10), 1468(10 to 5), 1486(11 to 6), 1491(1 to 9), 1497(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1461: 55.000000), (1486: 35.000000), (1491: 35.000000), (1497: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1453: 2), (1454: 2), (1461: 8), (1462: 5), (1468: 2), (1486: 3), (1491: 3), (1497: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
