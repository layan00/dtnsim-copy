The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
520(2 to 10), 521(8 to 3), 529(3 to 11), 530(12 to 10), 537(10 to 5), 554(11 to 6), 558(1 to 9), 571(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(529: 35.000000), (537: 45.000000), (554: 35.000000), (558: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(520: 2), (521: 2), (529: 5), (530: 4), (537: 4), (554: 3), (558: 5), (571: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
