The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(2 to 10), 206(8 to 3), 215(3 to 11), 216(12 to 10), 224(10 to 5), 242(11 to 6), 246(1 to 9), 253(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 75.000000), (224: 85.000000), (246: 25.000000), (253: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 2), (206: 2), (215: 10), (216: 4), (224: 9), (242: 3), (246: 5), (253: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
