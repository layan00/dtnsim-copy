The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1155(2 to 10), 1156(8 to 3), 1165(3 to 11), 1166(12 to 10), 1175(10 to 5), 1195(11 to 6), 1200(1 to 9), 1209(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1165: 75.000000), (1175: 85.000000), (1200: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1155: 2), (1156: 2), (1165: 12), (1166: 4), (1175: 9), (1195: 3), (1200: 4), (1209: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
