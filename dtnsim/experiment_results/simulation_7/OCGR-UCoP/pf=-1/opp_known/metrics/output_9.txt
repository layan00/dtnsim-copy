The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1471(2 to 10), 1472(8 to 3), 1479(3 to 11), 1480(12 to 10), 1485(10 to 5), 1505(11 to 6), 1509(1 to 9), 1516(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1479: 35.000000), (1485: 45.000000), (1505: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1471: 2), (1472: 2), (1479: 5), (1480: 4), (1485: 4), (1505: 3), (1509: 2), (1516: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
