The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
523(2 to 10), 524(8 to 3), 532(3 to 11), 533(12 to 10), 540(10 to 5), 558(11 to 6), 564(1 to 9), 572(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(532: 75.000000), (533: 45.000000), (540: 85.000000), (558: 35.000000), (564: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(523: 2), (524: 2), (532: 10), (533: 5), (540: 9), (558: 3), (564: 5), (572: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
