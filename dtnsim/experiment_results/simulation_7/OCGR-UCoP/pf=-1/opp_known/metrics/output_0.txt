The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(2 to 10), 214(8 to 3), 221(3 to 11), 222(12 to 10), 230(10 to 5), 248(11 to 6), 253(1 to 9), 265(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 55.000000), (248: 35.000000), (253: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 2), (214: 2), (221: 8), (222: 4), (230: 2), (248: 3), (253: 4), (265: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 10 calls to RUCoP, which took 81 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
