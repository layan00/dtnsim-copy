The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
527(2 to 10), 528(8 to 3), 536(3 to 11), 537(12 to 10), 544(10 to 5), 562(11 to 6), 566(1 to 9), 579(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(536: 35.000000), (544: 45.000000), (562: 35.000000), (566: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(527: 2), (528: 2), (536: 5), (537: 4), (544: 4), (562: 3), (566: 5), (579: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
