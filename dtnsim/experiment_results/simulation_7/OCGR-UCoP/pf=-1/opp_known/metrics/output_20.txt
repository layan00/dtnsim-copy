The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(2 to 10), 213(8 to 3), 219(3 to 11), 220(12 to 10), 226(10 to 5), 244(11 to 6), 251(1 to 9), 263(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 75.000000), (220: 45.000000), (226: 35.000000), (244: 35.000000), (251: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 2), (213: 2), (219: 4), (220: 5), (226: 3), (244: 3), (251: 5), (263: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
