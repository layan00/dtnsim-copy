The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1162(2 to 10), 1163(8 to 3), 1171(3 to 11), 1172(12 to 10), 1179(10 to 5), 1197(11 to 6), 1204(1 to 9), 1214(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1179: 35.000000), (1197: 35.000000), (1204: 0.000000), (1214: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1162: 2), (1163: 2), (1171: 6), (1172: 5), (1179: 3), (1197: 3), (1204: 4), (1214: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
