The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
838(2 to 10), 839(8 to 3), 849(3 to 11), 850(12 to 10), 859(10 to 5), 883(11 to 6), 889(1 to 9), 900(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(849: 55.000000), (859: 35.000000), (883: 35.000000), (889: 0.000000), (900: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(838: 2), (839: 2), (849: 10), (850: 6), (859: 3), (883: 3), (889: 4), (900: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
