The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
845(2 to 10), 846(8 to 3), 855(3 to 11), 856(12 to 10), 865(10 to 5), 883(11 to 6), 887(1 to 9), 896(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(855: 55.000000), (865: 35.000000), (883: 35.000000), (887: 35.000000), (896: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(845: 2), (846: 2), (855: 8), (856: 4), (865: 3), (883: 3), (887: 3), (896: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
