The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
837(2 to 10), 838(8 to 3), 845(3 to 11), 846(12 to 10), 851(10 to 5), 868(11 to 6), 875(1 to 9), 885(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(868: 35.000000), (875: 25.000000), (885: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(837: 2), (838: 2), (845: 2), (846: 5), (851: 2), (868: 3), (875: 5), (885: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
