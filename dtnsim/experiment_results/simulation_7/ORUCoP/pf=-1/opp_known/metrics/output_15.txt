The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(2 to 10), 195(8 to 3), 203(3 to 11), 204(12 to 10), 211(10 to 5), 242(11 to 6), 259(1 to 9), 277(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(194: 55.000000), (195: 25.000000), (204: 45.000000), (242: 35.000000), (259: 0.000000), (277: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(194: 6), (195: 4), (203: 3), (204: 14), (211: 2), (242: 10), (259: 5), (277: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
