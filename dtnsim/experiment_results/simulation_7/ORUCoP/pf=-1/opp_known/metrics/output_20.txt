The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
201(2 to 10), 202(8 to 3), 208(3 to 11), 209(12 to 10), 218(10 to 5), 241(11 to 6), 256(1 to 9), 274(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 55.000000), (202: 25.000000), (208: 75.000000), (209: 45.000000), (218: 35.000000), (241: 35.000000), (256: 25.000000), (274: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(201: 7), (202: 4), (208: 3), (209: 8), (218: 3), (241: 7), (256: 5), (274: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
