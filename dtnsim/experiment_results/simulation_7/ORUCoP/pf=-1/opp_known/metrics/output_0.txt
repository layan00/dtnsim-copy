The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(2 to 10), 203(8 to 3), 213(3 to 11), 214(12 to 10), 228(10 to 5), 259(11 to 6), 269(1 to 9), 283(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 55.000000), (203: 25.000000), (213: 55.000000), (228: 85.000000), (259: 35.000000), (269: 0.000000), (283: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 5), (203: 14), (213: 10), (214: 4), (228: 8), (259: 6), (269: 5), (283: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 128 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
