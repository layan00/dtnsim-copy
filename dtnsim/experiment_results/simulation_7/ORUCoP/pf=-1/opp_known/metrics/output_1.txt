The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
548(2 to 10), 549(8 to 3), 557(3 to 11), 558(12 to 10), 567(10 to 5), 592(11 to 6), 607(1 to 9), 626(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(548: 55.000000), (549: 25.000000), (557: 55.000000), (558: 45.000000), (567: 35.000000), (607: 35.000000), (626: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(548: 7), (549: 4), (557: 7), (558: 8), (567: 3), (592: 7), (607: 5), (626: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
