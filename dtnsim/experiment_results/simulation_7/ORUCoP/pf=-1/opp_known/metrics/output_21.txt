The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
526(2 to 10), 527(8 to 3), 536(3 to 11), 537(12 to 10), 544(10 to 5), 575(11 to 6), 591(1 to 9), 608(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(526: 55.000000), (527: 25.000000), (536: 55.000000), (537: 45.000000), (544: 35.000000), (575: 35.000000), (608: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(526: 6), (527: 4), (536: 6), (537: 14), (544: 5), (575: 10), (608: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
