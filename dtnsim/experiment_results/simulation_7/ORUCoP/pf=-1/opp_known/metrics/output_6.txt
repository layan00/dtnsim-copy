The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
524(2 to 10), 525(8 to 3), 533(3 to 11), 534(12 to 10), 541(10 to 5), 568(11 to 6), 576(1 to 9), 594(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(524: 55.000000), (525: 25.000000), (533: 35.000000), (541: 35.000000), (568: 35.000000), (576: 25.000000), (594: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(524: 6), (525: 4), (533: 4), (534: 4), (541: 5), (568: 6), (576: 4), (594: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
