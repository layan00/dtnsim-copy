The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
523(2 to 10), 524(8 to 3), 532(3 to 11), 533(12 to 10), 540(10 to 5), 567(11 to 6), 579(1 to 9), 592(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(523: 55.000000), (524: 25.000000), (532: 75.000000), (533: 45.000000), (540: 85.000000), (567: 35.000000), (579: 25.000000), (592: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(523: 6), (524: 4), (532: 6), (533: 8), (540: 7), (567: 9), (579: 5), (592: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
