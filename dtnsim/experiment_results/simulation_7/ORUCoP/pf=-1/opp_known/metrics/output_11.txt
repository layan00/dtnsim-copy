The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
504(2 to 10), 505(8 to 3), 513(3 to 11), 514(12 to 10), 522(10 to 5), 552(11 to 6), 556(1 to 9), 579(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(504: 55.000000), (505: 25.000000), (513: 55.000000), (514: 45.000000), (522: 35.000000), (556: 0.000000), (579: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(504: 6), (505: 4), (513: 8), (514: 9), (522: 3), (552: 4), (556: 5), (579: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
