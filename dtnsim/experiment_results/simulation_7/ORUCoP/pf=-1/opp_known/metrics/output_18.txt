The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1155(2 to 10), 1156(8 to 3), 1165(3 to 11), 1166(12 to 10), 1172(10 to 5), 1201(11 to 6), 1214(1 to 9), 1231(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1155: 55.000000), (1156: 25.000000), (1165: 55.000000), (1166: 45.000000), (1172: 35.000000), (1201: 35.000000), (1214: 35.000000), (1231: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1155: 6), (1156: 4), (1165: 6), (1166: 8), (1172: 4), (1201: 7), (1214: 5), (1231: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
