The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1191(2 to 10), 1192(8 to 3), 1201(3 to 11), 1202(12 to 10), 1211(10 to 5), 1236(11 to 6), 1246(1 to 9), 1258(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1191: 55.000000), (1192: 25.000000), (1201: 75.000000), (1211: 85.000000), (1246: 0.000000), (1258: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1191: 5), (1192: 4), (1201: 6), (1202: 4), (1211: 7), (1236: 5), (1246: 5), (1258: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
