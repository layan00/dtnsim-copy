The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
643(2 to 10), 644(8 to 3), 671(3 to 11), 672(12 to 10), 687(10 to 5), 722(11 to 6), 728(1 to 9), 758(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(643: 55.000000), (671: 75.000000), (687: 35.000000), (728: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(643: 6), (644: 10), (671: 9), (672: 4), (687: 5), (722: 4), (728: 5), (758: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 58 calls to RUCoP, which took 266 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
