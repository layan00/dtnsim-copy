The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
651(2 to 10), 652(8 to 3), 679(3 to 11), 680(12 to 10), 694(10 to 5), 727(11 to 6), 732(1 to 9), 760(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(651: 55.000000), (679: 35.000000), (694: 35.000000), (727: 35.000000), (732: 25.000000), (760: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(651: 6), (652: 10), (679: 6), (680: 4), (694: 2), (727: 5), (732: 5), (760: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 217 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
