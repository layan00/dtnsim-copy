The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
646(2 to 10), 647(8 to 3), 674(3 to 11), 675(12 to 10), 689(10 to 5), 724(11 to 6), 733(1 to 9), 758(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(646: 55.000000), (674: 75.000000), (675: 45.000000), (724: 35.000000), (733: 25.000000), (758: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(646: 6), (647: 12), (674: 10), (675: 8), (689: 7), (724: 5), (733: 5), (758: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 30 calls to RUCoP, which took 166 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
