The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2005(2 to 10), 2006(8 to 3), 2031(3 to 11), 2032(12 to 10), 2040(10 to 5), 2078(11 to 6), 2083(1 to 9), 2105(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2005: 55.000000), (2006: 25.000000), (2031: 35.000000), (2078: 35.000000), (2105: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2005: 6), (2006: 6), (2031: 6), (2032: 4), (2040: 7), (2078: 5), (2105: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 172 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
