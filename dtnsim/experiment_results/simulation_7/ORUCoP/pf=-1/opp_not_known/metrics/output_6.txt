The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
659(2 to 10), 660(8 to 3), 687(3 to 11), 688(12 to 10), 702(10 to 5), 737(11 to 6), 742(1 to 9), 772(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(659: 55.000000), (687: 35.000000), (702: 35.000000), (737: 35.000000), (742: 25.000000), (772: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(659: 6), (660: 10), (687: 7), (688: 4), (702: 5), (737: 7), (742: 4), (772: 4), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 48 calls to RUCoP, which took 218 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
