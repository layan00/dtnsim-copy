The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
214(2 to 10), 215(8 to 3), 241(3 to 11), 242(12 to 10), 257(10 to 5), 292(11 to 6), 298(1 to 9), 327(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 55.000000), (241: 75.000000), (257: 35.000000), (292: 35.000000), (298: 0.000000), (327: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(214: 6), (215: 10), (241: 10), (242: 4), (257: 3), (292: 5), (298: 5), (327: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 42 calls to RUCoP, which took 191 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
