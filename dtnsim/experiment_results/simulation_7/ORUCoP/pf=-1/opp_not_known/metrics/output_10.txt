The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(2 to 10), 199(8 to 3), 227(3 to 11), 228(12 to 10), 243(10 to 5), 278(11 to 6), 285(1 to 9), 306(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 75.000000), (285: 25.000000), (306: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(198: 4), (199: 10), (227: 8), (228: 4), (243: 7), (278: 4), (285: 5), (306: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 52 calls to RUCoP, which took 213 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
