The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(2 to 10), 214(8 to 3), 239(3 to 11), 240(12 to 10), 249(10 to 5), 285(11 to 6), 294(1 to 9), 324(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 55.000000), (214: 25.000000), (239: 75.000000), (240: 45.000000), (249: 35.000000), (285: 35.000000), (294: 25.000000), (324: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 6), (214: 9), (239: 3), (240: 8), (249: 5), (285: 7), (294: 5), (324: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 28 calls to RUCoP, which took 152 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
