The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(2 to 10), 209(8 to 3), 234(3 to 11), 235(12 to 10), 246(10 to 5), 282(11 to 6), 291(1 to 9), 316(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(209: 25.000000), (234: 75.000000), (246: 35.000000), (282: 35.000000), (291: 0.000000), (316: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 5), (209: 6), (234: 10), (235: 8), (246: 5), (282: 5), (291: 6), (316: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 223 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
