The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1993(2 to 10), 1994(8 to 3), 2023(3 to 11), 2024(12 to 10), 2036(10 to 5), 2070(11 to 6), 2076(1 to 9), 2103(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1994: 5.000000), (2023: 35.000000), (2036: 35.000000), (2070: 35.000000), (2076: 0.000000), (2103: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1993: 4), (1994: 6), (2023: 7), (2024: 4), (2036: 5), (2070: 5), (2076: 5), (2103: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 188 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
