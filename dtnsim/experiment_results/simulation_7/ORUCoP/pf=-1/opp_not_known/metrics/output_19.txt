The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1979(2 to 10), 1980(8 to 3), 2006(3 to 11), 2007(12 to 10), 2020(10 to 5), 2054(11 to 6), 2062(1 to 9), 2081(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2006: 75.000000), (2054: 35.000000), (2062: 35.000000), (2081: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1979: 4), (1980: 12), (2006: 10), (2007: 6), (2054: 5), (2062: 6), (2081: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 206 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
