The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1108(2 to 10), 1109(8 to 3), 1135(3 to 11), 1136(12 to 10), 1150(10 to 5), 1184(11 to 6), 1189(1 to 9), 1216(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1108: 55.000000), (1135: 95.000000), (1150: 35.000000), (1184: 35.000000), (1189: 25.000000), (1216: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1108: 6), (1109: 10), (1135: 9), (1136: 4), (1150: 2), (1184: 7), (1189: 6), (1216: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 50 calls to RUCoP, which took 227 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
