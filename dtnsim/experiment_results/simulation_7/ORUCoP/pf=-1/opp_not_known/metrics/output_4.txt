The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2004(2 to 10), 2005(8 to 3), 2032(3 to 11), 2033(12 to 10), 2044(10 to 5), 2078(11 to 6), 2086(1 to 9), 2115(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2004: 55.000000), (2032: 75.000000), (2033: 45.000000), (2044: 35.000000), (2078: 35.000000), (2086: 35.000000), (2115: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2004: 6), (2005: 6), (2032: 6), (2033: 8), (2044: 5), (2078: 4), (2086: 5), (2115: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 36 calls to RUCoP, which took 196 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
