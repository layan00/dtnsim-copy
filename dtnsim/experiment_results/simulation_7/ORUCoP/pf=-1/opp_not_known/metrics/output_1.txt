The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
669(2 to 10), 670(8 to 3), 697(3 to 11), 698(12 to 10), 713(10 to 5), 747(11 to 6), 757(1 to 9), 787(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(669: 55.000000), (698: 45.000000), (713: 35.000000), (757: 35.000000), (787: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(669: 6), (670: 12), (697: 8), (698: 8), (713: 3), (747: 3), (757: 5), (787: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 46 calls to RUCoP, which took 231 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
