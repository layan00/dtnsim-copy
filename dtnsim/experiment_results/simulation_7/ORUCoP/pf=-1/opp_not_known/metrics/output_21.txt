The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(2 to 10), 665(8 to 3), 693(3 to 11), 694(12 to 10), 708(10 to 5), 744(11 to 6), 752(1 to 9), 779(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(664: 55.000000), (693: 95.000000), (694: 45.000000), (708: 35.000000), (744: 35.000000), (779: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(664: 6), (665: 12), (693: 8), (694: 8), (708: 5), (744: 5), (779: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 34 calls to RUCoP, which took 184 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
