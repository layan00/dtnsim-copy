The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
64(2 to 10), 65(8 to 3), 72(3 to 11), 73(12 to 10), 84(10 to 5), 90(11 to 6), 97(1 to 9), 108(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(65: 25.000000), (72: 75.000000), (84: 35.000000), (90: 15.000000), (97: 35.000000), (108: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(65: 4), (72: 6), (84: 3), (90: 5), (97: 6), (108: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
