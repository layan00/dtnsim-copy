The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
198(2 to 10), 199(8 to 3), 207(3 to 11), 208(12 to 10), 217(10 to 5), 222(11 to 6), 226(1 to 9), 241(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(207: 35.000000), (217: 35.000000), (222: 35.000000), (241: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(199: 2), (207: 4), (217: 4), (222: 5), (241: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
