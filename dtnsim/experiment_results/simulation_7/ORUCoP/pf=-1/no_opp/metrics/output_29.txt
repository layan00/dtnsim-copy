The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
567(2 to 10), 568(8 to 3), 576(3 to 11), 577(12 to 10), 587(10 to 5), 596(11 to 6), 602(1 to 9), 609(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(568: 25.000000), (587: 35.000000), (596: 35.000000), (609: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(568: 6), (576: 3), (587: 3), (596: 4), (602: 4), (609: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
