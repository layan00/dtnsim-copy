The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
60(2 to 10), 61(8 to 3), 69(3 to 11), 70(12 to 10), 79(10 to 5), 84(11 to 6), 88(1 to 9), 100(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(69: 75.000000), (79: 35.000000), (84: 35.000000), (100: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(61: 2), (69: 9), (79: 3), (84: 5), (100: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
