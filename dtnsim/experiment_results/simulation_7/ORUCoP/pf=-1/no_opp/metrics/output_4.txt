The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
584(2 to 10), 585(8 to 3), 593(3 to 11), 594(12 to 10), 603(10 to 5), 609(11 to 6), 614(1 to 9), 625(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(585: 25.000000), (593: 75.000000), (603: 35.000000), (609: 35.000000), (614: 35.000000), (625: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(585: 4), (593: 4), (603: 3), (609: 4), (614: 6), (625: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
