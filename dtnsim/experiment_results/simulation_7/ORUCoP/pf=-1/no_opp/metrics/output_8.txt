The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
466(2 to 10), 467(8 to 3), 475(3 to 11), 476(12 to 10), 486(10 to 5), 492(11 to 6), 499(1 to 9), 509(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(467: 25.000000), (486: 35.000000), (492: 35.000000), (499: 35.000000), (509: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(467: 4), (475: 4), (486: 3), (492: 6), (499: 6), (509: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
