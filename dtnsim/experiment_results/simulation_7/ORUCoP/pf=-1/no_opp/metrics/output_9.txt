The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
588(2 to 10), 589(8 to 3), 596(3 to 11), 597(12 to 10), 604(10 to 5), 609(11 to 6), 614(1 to 9), 622(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(596: 75.000000), (622: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(589: 2), (596: 4), (604: 4), (609: 5), (622: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
