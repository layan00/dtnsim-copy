The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
62(2 to 10), 63(8 to 3), 71(3 to 11), 72(12 to 10), 81(10 to 5), 88(11 to 6), 94(1 to 9), 103(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(63: 25.000000), (71: 75.000000), (88: 35.000000), (94: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(63: 4), (71: 4), (81: 2), (88: 5), (94: 6), (103: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
