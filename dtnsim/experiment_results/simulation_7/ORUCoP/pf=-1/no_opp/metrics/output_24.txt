The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
570(2 to 10), 571(8 to 3), 579(3 to 11), 580(12 to 10), 590(10 to 5), 596(11 to 6), 600(1 to 9), 609(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(571: 25.000000), (579: 75.000000), (600: 35.000000), (609: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(571: 4), (579: 5), (590: 4), (596: 5), (600: 6), (609: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
