The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
183(2 to 10), 184(8 to 3), 192(3 to 11), 193(12 to 10), 203(10 to 5), 206(11 to 6), 210(1 to 9), 222(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(192: 35.000000), (206: 35.000000), (222: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(184: 3), (192: 5), (206: 5), (210: 4), (222: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 210: (to: 5, time: 80.000000), (to: 5, time: 80.000000),
