The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
194(2 to 10), 195(8 to 3), 205(3 to 11), 206(12 to 10), 215(10 to 5), 221(11 to 6), 225(1 to 9), 238(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 35.000000), (221: 35.000000), (238: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(195: 3), (205: 4), (215: 4), (221: 5), (238: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
