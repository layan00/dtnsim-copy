The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
70(2 to 10), 71(8 to 3), 78(3 to 11), 79(12 to 10), 94(10 to 5), 100(11 to 6), 106(1 to 9), 121(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(70: 55.000000), (78: 75.000000), (94: 35.000000), (100: 35.000000), (106: 35.000000), (121: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(70: 6), (71: 1), (78: 10), (94: 3), (100: 5), (106: 6), (121: 3), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 16 calls to RUCoP, which took 79 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
