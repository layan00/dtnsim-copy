The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
308(2 to 10), 309(8 to 3), 315(3 to 11), 316(12 to 10), 323(10 to 5), 328(11 to 6), 334(1 to 9), 346(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(323: 35.000000), (328: 35.000000), (346: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(309: 1), (323: 3), (328: 5), (346: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
