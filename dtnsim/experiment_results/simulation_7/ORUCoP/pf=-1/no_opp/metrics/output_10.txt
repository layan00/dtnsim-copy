The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
54(2 to 10), 55(8 to 3), 65(3 to 11), 66(12 to 10), 77(10 to 5), 83(11 to 6), 86(1 to 9), 92(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(55: 25.000000), (65: 75.000000), (86: 35.000000), (92: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(55: 5), (65: 6), (77: 4), (86: 4), (92: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
