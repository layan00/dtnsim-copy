The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
343(2 to 10), 344(8 to 3), 350(3 to 11), 351(12 to 10), 361(10 to 5), 366(11 to 6), 371(1 to 9), 386(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(350: 35.000000), (361: 35.000000), (366: 35.000000), (386: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(344: 1), (350: 4), (361: 4), (366: 5), (371: 4), (386: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
