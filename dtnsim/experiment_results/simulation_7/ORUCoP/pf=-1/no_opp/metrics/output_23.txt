The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
442(2 to 10), 443(8 to 3), 453(3 to 11), 454(12 to 10), 465(10 to 5), 470(11 to 6), 475(1 to 9), 491(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(443: 25.000000), (453: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(443: 5), (453: 4), (465: 3), (470: 4), (475: 2), (491: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
