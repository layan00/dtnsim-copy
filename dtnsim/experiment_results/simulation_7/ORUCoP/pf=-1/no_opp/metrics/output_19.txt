The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
540(2 to 10), 541(8 to 3), 547(3 to 11), 548(12 to 10), 556(10 to 5), 561(11 to 6), 565(1 to 9), 574(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(547: 75.000000), (561: 35.000000), (565: 35.000000), (574: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(541: 1), (547: 6), (561: 5), (565: 6), (574: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
