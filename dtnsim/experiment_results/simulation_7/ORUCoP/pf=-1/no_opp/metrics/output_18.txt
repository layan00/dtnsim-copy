The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
419(2 to 10), 420(8 to 3), 430(3 to 11), 431(12 to 10), 439(10 to 5), 445(11 to 6), 450(1 to 9), 462(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(430: 75.000000), (439: 35.000000), (445: 35.000000), (450: 35.000000), (462: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(420: 3), (430: 6), (439: 3), (445: 4), (450: 6), (462: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
