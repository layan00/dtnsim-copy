The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
315(2 to 10), 316(8 to 3), 328(3 to 11), 329(12 to 10), 340(10 to 5), 345(11 to 6), 352(1 to 9), 360(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(316: 5.000000), (328: 75.000000), (345: 15.000000), (352: 35.000000), (360: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(316: 5), (328: 9), (345: 3), (352: 6), (360: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
