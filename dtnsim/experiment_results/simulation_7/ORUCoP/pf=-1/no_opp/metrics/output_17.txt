The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
302(2 to 10), 303(8 to 3), 311(3 to 11), 312(12 to 10), 319(10 to 5), 322(11 to 6), 326(1 to 9), 333(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(311: 75.000000), (326: 35.000000), (333: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(303: 2), (311: 6), (322: 3), (326: 6), (333: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
