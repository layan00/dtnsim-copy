The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
565(2 to 10), 566(8 to 3), 575(3 to 11), 576(12 to 10), 586(10 to 5), 591(11 to 6), 597(1 to 9), 609(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(575: 35.000000), (586: 35.000000), (591: 35.000000), (597: 35.000000), (609: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(566: 2), (575: 6), (586: 3), (591: 5), (597: 6), (609: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
