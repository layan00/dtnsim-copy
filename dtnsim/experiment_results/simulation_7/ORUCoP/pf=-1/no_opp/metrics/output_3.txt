The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
462(2 to 10), 463(8 to 3), 472(3 to 11), 473(12 to 10), 483(10 to 5), 489(11 to 6), 495(1 to 9), 503(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(463: 25.000000), (472: 75.000000), (503: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(463: 4), (472: 4), (483: 4), (489: 5), (495: 2), (503: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
