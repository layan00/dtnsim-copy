The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
324(2 to 10), 325(8 to 3), 335(3 to 11), 336(12 to 10), 348(10 to 5), 354(11 to 6), 359(1 to 9), 374(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(325: 25.000000), (335: 75.000000), (348: 35.000000), (354: 35.000000), (359: 35.000000), (374: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(325: 5), (335: 9), (348: 6), (354: 5), (359: 6), (374: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
