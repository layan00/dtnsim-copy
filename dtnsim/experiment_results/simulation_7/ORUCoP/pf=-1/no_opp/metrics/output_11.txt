The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
176(2 to 10), 177(8 to 3), 185(3 to 11), 186(12 to 10), 197(10 to 5), 203(11 to 6), 207(1 to 9), 221(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(177: 25.000000), (185: 75.000000), (197: 35.000000), (207: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(177: 4), (185: 9), (197: 3), (203: 5), (207: 4), (221: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
