The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(2 to 10), 216(8 to 3), 224(3 to 11), 225(12 to 10), 236(10 to 5), 242(11 to 6), 248(1 to 9), 261(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(216: 25.000000), (224: 75.000000), (236: 35.000000), (248: 35.000000), (261: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(216: 4), (224: 7), (236: 3), (242: 3), (248: 4), (261: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
