The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
185(2 to 10), 186(8 to 3), 194(3 to 11), 195(12 to 10), 204(10 to 5), 209(11 to 6), 214(1 to 9), 221(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(194: 75.000000), (214: 35.000000), (221: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 2), (194: 6), (204: 4), (209: 5), (214: 6), (221: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
