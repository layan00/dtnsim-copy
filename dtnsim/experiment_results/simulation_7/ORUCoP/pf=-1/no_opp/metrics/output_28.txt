The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
446(2 to 10), 447(8 to 3), 457(3 to 11), 458(12 to 10), 469(10 to 5), 476(11 to 6), 481(1 to 9), 495(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(447: 25.000000), (469: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(447: 5), (457: 4), (469: 4), (476: 4), (481: 2), (495: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
