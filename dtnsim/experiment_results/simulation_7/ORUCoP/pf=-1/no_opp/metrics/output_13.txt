The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
429(2 to 10), 430(8 to 3), 438(3 to 11), 439(12 to 10), 450(10 to 5), 456(11 to 6), 461(1 to 9), 476(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(430: 25.000000), (450: 35.000000), (456: 35.000000), (476: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(430: 4), (438: 5), (450: 3), (456: 4), (461: 4), (476: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
