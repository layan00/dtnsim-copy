The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
69(2 to 10), 70(8 to 3), 74(3 to 11), 75(12 to 10), 83(10 to 5), 88(11 to 6), 94(1 to 9), 106(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(74: 75.000000), (83: 35.000000), (88: 35.000000), (94: 35.000000), (106: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(74: 3), (83: 3), (88: 5), (94: 6), (106: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
