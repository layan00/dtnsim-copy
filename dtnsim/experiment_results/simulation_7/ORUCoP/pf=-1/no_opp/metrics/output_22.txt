The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
312(2 to 10), 313(8 to 3), 319(3 to 11), 320(12 to 10), 329(10 to 5), 333(11 to 6), 337(1 to 9), 348(7 to 12), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(333: 35.000000), (337: 35.000000), (348: 5.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(313: 1), (319: 6), (333: 5), (337: 6), (348: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
