# Hierarchical Inter-Regional Routing Implementation

This is the beginning of an implementation of the HIRR procedure as presented by Nicola Alessi in his Master's Thesis titled "Hierarchical Inter-Regional Routing Algorithm for Interplanetary Networks". It is not fully finished yet. Some details are not yet implemented, nor has its correctness been verified.
